To assess the performance of the GenoType\u00ae MTBDRsl assay in the detection of resistance to kanamycin (KM), capreomycin (CPM) and ofloxacin (OFX), and of XDR-TB. Consecutive acid-fast bacilli smear-positive sputum specimens identified as MDR-TB using the MTBDRplus test were evaluated with the MTBDRsl assay and conventional second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST). Among 159 specimens, amplification was adequate in 154 (97%), including 9 of 9 culture-negative and 2 of 3 contaminated specimens. Second-line DST revealed that 17 (12%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were XDR-TB. Compared to DST, the MTBDRsl had 41% sensitivity and 98% specificity in detecting XDR-TB and 81% sensitivity and 99% specificity in detecting OFX resistance. Sensitivity was low in detecting resistance to KM (29%) and CPM (57%), while specificity was respectively 99% and 94%. Median times from sputum collection to second-line DST and MTBDRsl results were 70-104 vs. 10 days. Although the MTBDRsl assay had a rapid turnaround time, detection of second-line drug resistance was poor compared to DST. Further genetic mutations associated with resistance to second-line drugs should be included in the assay to improve test performance and clinical utility."}

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Microbiological confirmation is rare, and treatment is often delayed, increasing mortality and morbidity. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF test was evaluated in a large cohort of patients with suspected tuberculous meningitis. Three hundred seventy-nine patients presenting with suspected tuberculous meningitis to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, between 17 April 2011 and 31 December 2012 were included in the study. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were tested by Ziehl-Neelsen smear, mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Rifampin (RIF) resistance results by Xpert were confirmed by an MTBDR-Plus line probe assay and all positive cultures were tested by phenotypic MGIT drug susceptibility testing. Overall, 182/379 included patients (48.0%) were diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis. Sensitivities of Xpert, smear, and MGIT culture among patients diagnosed with TBM were 59.3% (108/182 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 51.8 to 66.5%]), 78.6% (143/182 [95% CI, 71.9 to 84.3%]) and 66.5% (121/182 [95% CI, 59.1 to 73.3%]), respectively. There was one false-positive Xpert MTB/RIF test (99.5% specificity). Four cases of RIF resistance (4/109; 3.7%) were identified by Xpert, of which 3 were confirmed to be multidrug-resistant (MDR) TBM and one was culture negative. Xpert MTB/RIF is a rapid and specific test for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. The addition of a vortexing step to sample processing increased sensitivity for confirmed TBM by 20% (P = 0.04). Meticulous examination of a smear from a large volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains the most sensitive technique but is not practical in most laboratories. The Xpert MTB/RIF represents a significant advance in the early diagnosis of this devastating condition."}

Given the increases in drug-resistant tuberculosis, laboratory capacities for drug susceptibility testing are being scaled up worldwide. A laboratory must decide among several endorsed methodologies. We evaluated 87 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates for concordance of susceptibility results across six methods: the L-J proportion method, MGIT 960 SIRE AST, Gene/Xpert MTB/RIF, GenoType MTBDRplus line probe assay, MycoTB MIC plate, and a laboratory-developed mycobacteriophage quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based method. Most (80%) isolates were multidrug resistant. Of the culture-based methods, the mycobacteriophage qPCR method was fastest, the L-J proportion method was the slowest, and the MGIT method required the most repeat testing (P < 0.05). For isoniazid (INH), 82% of isolates were susceptible by all methods or resistant by all methods, whereas for rifampin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), and streptomycin (STR), such complete concordance was observed in 77%, 50%, and 51% of isolates, respectively (P < 0.05 for INH or RIF versus EMB or STR). The discrepancies of EMB and STR stemmed largely from diminished concordance of the MGIT EMB results (kappa coefficient range, 0.26 to 0.30) and the L-J STR result (kappa range, 0.35 to 0.45) versus other methods. Phage qPCR and the MycoTB MIC plate were the only methods that yielded second-line susceptibilities and revealed significant quantitative correlations for all drugs except cycloserine, as well as moderate to excellent kappa coefficients for all drugs except for para-aminosalicylic acid. In summary, the performance of M. tuberculosis susceptibility testing differs by platform and by drug. Laboratories should carefully consider these factors before choosing one methodology, particularly in settings where EMB and STR results are clinically important."}

In addition, we were unable to evaluate critical concentration thresholds for the colorimetric tests. Rapid tests for rifampicin resistance alone cannot accurately predict rifampicin resistance or MDR-TB in areas with a low prevalence of rifampicin resistance.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the new, novel GenoType\u00ae MTBDRplus assay for rapid detection of drug susceptibility testing (DST) of MDR-TB cases in Northern India. A total of 550 specimens were collected from highly suspected drug resistant from pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB cases.

Resistance to drugs is due to particular genomic mutations in the specific genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Timely genetic characterization will allow identification of resistance mutations that will optimize an effective antibiotic treatment regimen. We determine the magnitude of gene mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and ethambutol (EMB) among tuberculosis (TB) lymphadenitis patients. A cross sectional prospective study was conducted among 226 M.tuberculosis isolates from culture positive lymph node aspirates collected from TB lymphadenitis patients between April 2012 and May 2012. Detection of mutations conferring resistance to drugs was carried out using GenoType(\u00ae) MTBDRplus and GenoType\u00ae MTBDRsl assay. Out of the 226 strains, mutations conferring resistance to INH, RMP, multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and EMB were 8, 3, 2 and 2 isolates, respectively. There was no isolated strain that showed mutation in the inhA promoter region gene. All INH resistant strains had mutations in the katG gene at codon 315 with amino acid change of S315T1. Among rifampicin resistant strains, two isolates displayed mutations at codon 531 in the rpoB gene with amino acid change of S531L and one isolate was by omission of wild type probes at Q513L. According to mutations associated with ethambutol resistance, all of the isolates had mutations in the embB gene with aminoacid change of M306I. All isolates resistant to INH, RMP and MDR using BacT/AlerT 3D system were correctly identified by GenoType\u00ae MTBDRplus assay. We observed mutations conferring resistance to INH at S315T1 of the katG gene, RMP at S531L and Q513L in the rpoB genes and EMB at M306I of the embB gene. In the absence of conventional drug susceptibility testing, the effort to develop easy, rapid and cost effective molecular assays for drug resistance TB monitoring is definitely desirable and the GenoType\u00ae MTBDRplus assay was found to be a useful method for diagnosis of resistance to INH, RMP and MDR from lymph node aspirates. Further molecular cluster analysis to determine transmission dynamics of mutated strain is required."}

In this cross-sectional study, 269 previously treated sputum-smear acid-fast bacilli (AFB) positive MDR-TB suspects were enrolled from January to September 2012 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital, New Delhi. Line probe assay (LPA) was performed directly on the sputum specimens and the results were compared with that of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST) on solid media [Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) method]. DST results by LPA and LJ methods were compared in 242 MDR-TB suspects. The LPA detected rifampicin (RIF) resistance in 70 of 71 cases, isoniazid (INH) resistance in 86 of 93 cases, and MDR-TB in 66 of 68 cases as compared to the conventional method. Overall (rifampicin, isoniazid and MDR-TB) concordance of the LPA with the conventional DST was 96%. Sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 99% respectively for detection of RIF resistance; 92% and 99% respectively for detection of INH resistance; 97% and 100% respectively for detection of MDR-TB. Frequencies of katG gene, inhA gene and combined katG and inhA gene mutations conferring all INH resistance were 72/87 (83%), 10/87 (11%) and 5/87 (6%) respectively. The turnaround time of the LPA test was 48 hours. The LPA test provides an early diagnosis of monoresistance to isoniazid and rifampicin and is highly sensitive and specific for an early diagnosis of MDR-TB. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the LPA test can be useful in early diagnosis of drug resistant TB in high TB burden countries."}

We conducted a detailed reference laboratory cost analysis of new rapid molecular assays (Xpert and MTBDRplus) for tuberculosis testing and drug-resistance testing in South Africa, and compared with the costs of conventional approaches involving sputum microscopy, liquid mycobacterial culture, and phenotypic drug sensitivity testing. From a laboratory perspective, Xpert MTB/RIF cost $14.93/sample and the MTBDRplus line probe assay cost $23.46/sample, compared to $16.88/sample using conventional automated liquid culture-based methods. Laboratory costs of Xpert and MTBDRplus were most influenced by cost of consumables (60-80%).

Rifampicin resistance was confirmed by genotypical and/or phenotypical tests in 73 isolates (76.8%). Nineteen isolates, defined as rifampicin resistant and rifabutin susceptible according to the present breakpoint, exhibited significantly higher MICs of rifabutin (0.064-0.5 mg/L) than rifabutin-susceptible isolates without any detectable mutations in rpoB (P\u200a<\u200a0.001). These 19 isolates were clearly resistant to rifampicin (MIC 2-256 mg/L) and all but one had mutations in rpoB, with 9 (47.4%) specifically in Asp516Val. Our results indicate that rifampicin-resistant but rifabutin-susceptible isolates according to the present breakpoints harbour rpoB mutations and have a rifabutin MIC significantly higher than strains without any detectable mutations in rpoB.

At regular clinical visits over a 12-month period, we collected sputa from HIV-infected patients presenting with signs or symptoms of TB at 2 Nigerian clinics. Sputa were stained for AFB and tested using the Genotype MTBDRplus to confirm the presence of Mtb. Other species were identified using 16S rRNA sequence. In 56% (233/415) of AFB-positive patients, Mtb was confirmed. The patients on antiretroviral therapy were less likely than those not on antiretroviral therapy to be infected with Mtb [odds ratio (OR) = 0.25, P = 0.003]. In a multivariate logistic regression model using clinical features and diagnostic results, abnormal respiratory findings on auscultation (OR = 3.28, P = 0.03) and a direct sputum smear grade >3/100 (OR = 6.4, 4.6, P < 0.02) were significant predictors of Mtb infection. Concentrated sputum smear was predictive of Mtb infection only at the highest grades (2+, 3+).

The search terms of \"MTBDRsl\" and \"tuberculosis\" were used on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. QUADAS-2 was used to assess the quality of included studies. Data were analyzed by Meta-Disc 1.4. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study. From these calculations, forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were produced. Patient selection bias as well as flow and timing bias were observed in most studies. The summarized sensitivity (95% CI) was 0.874(0.845-0.899), 0.826(0.777-0.869), 0.820(0.772-0.862), 0.444(0.396-0.492), and 0.679(0.652-0.706) for fluoroquinolones, amikacin, capreomycin, kanamycin, and ethambutol, respectively. The specificity (95% CI) was 0.971(0.961-0.980), 0.995(0.987-0.998), 0.973(0.963-0.981), 0.993(0.985-0.997), and 0.799(0.773-0.823), respectively. The AUC (standard error) were 0.9754(0.0203), 0.9300(0.0598), 0.9885(0.0038), 0.9689(0.0359), and 0.6846(0.0550), respectively. Genotype MTBDRsl showed good accuracy for detecting drug resistance to fluoroquinolones, amikacin and capreomycin, but it may not be an appropriate choice for kanamycin and ethambutol. The lack of data did not allow for proper evaluation of the test on clinical specimens. Further systematic assessment of diagnostic performance should be carried out on direct clinical samples."}

A total of 183 consecutive MDR-TB isolates collected between September 2009 and February 2012 were characterised using molecular typing. Prior to the study, the isolates were confirmed as MDR-TB using GenoType MTBDRplus. Recent transmission index was used to analyse the clusters. Spoligotyping identified 43 different patterns, of which 17 consisted of at least two isolates forming clusters, while 26 had only a single isolate. The most frequent patterns were spoligo international typing (SIT) number 21 and 149. Twenty-four patterns did not match existing patterns in the SpolDB4 database. The strains belonged to three lineages, the predominant lineages being Euro-American and Indo-Oceanic, each consisting of 65 isolates. High proportions (86%) of patients were infected with clustered strains, suggesting probable recent transmission of MDR-TB in the study area. The observation of cluster formation of the spoligotype patterns of MDR-TB isolates could suggest transmission of MDR-TB strains among the population, thus warranting further attention."}

The MTBDR assay was performed on 428 samples, and the results were retrospectively compared with the results of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). The interval between treatment and diagnosis of drug resistance was also compared. The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the MTBDR assay were respectively 96.6%, 98.9%, 93.4% and 99.5% for the detection of rifampicin (RMP) resistance; 93.8%, 98.3%, 92.7% and 98.6% for isoniazid (INH) resistance; and 91.1%, 99.2%, 99.4% and 98.7% for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The median interval between the start of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy and the reporting of results was 88.9 days for conventional DST and 19.8 days for MTBDR using clinical specimens. The specificity of the MTBDR assay in detecting MDR-TB was very high, although the sensitivity in detecting INH resistance and MDR-TB was not optimal (<95%).

Sequencing suggested that 36.9% (55/149) of ethambutol-resistant strains had no embB306 mutation and that 26.8% (40/149) had embB497 mutation not covered by MTBDRsl. Furthermore, MTBDRsl indicated ethambutol resistance in 23.2% (26/112) of ethambutol-susceptible strains, of which 92.3% (24/26) were confirmed resistant by sequencing. This study demonstrated that genotypic resistance to ethambutol, kanamycin, and ofloxacin in MTB can be quickly determined with the MTBDRsl. As a rapid and convenient genetic method, this assay could function as a supplement to traditional DST. More relevant genetic markers are needed to improve sensitivity."}

Diagnosis of drug resistance and timely initiation of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis therapy are essential to reduce transmission and improve patient outcomes. We sought to determine whether implementation of the rapid MTBDRplus diagnostic shortened the time from specimen collection to patient MDR tuberculosis therapy initiation. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 197 MDR tuberculosis patients treated at Brewelskloof, a rural tuberculosis hospital in Western Cape Province, South Africa, between 2007 and 2011. Eighty-nine patients (45%) were tested using conventional liquid culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) on solid medium and 108 (55%) were tested using the MTBDRplus assay after positive acid-fast bacilli or culture. Median time from sample taken to therapy initiation was reduced from 80 days (interquartile range [IQR] 62-100) for conventional DST to 55 days (IQR 37.5-78) with the MTBDRplus. Although the laboratory processing time declined significantly, operational delays persisted both in the laboratory and the clinical infrastructure for getting patients started on treatment. In multivariate analysis, patients tested using the MTBDRplus test had a reduced risk of starting treatment 60 days or more after sputum collection of 0.52 (P < .0001) compared with patients tested with culture-based DST, after adjustment for smear status and site of disease. Use of MTBDRplus significantly reduced time to MDR tuberculosis treatment initiation. However, DST reporting to clinics was delayed by more than 1 week due, in part, to laboratory operational delays, including dependence on smear and culture positivity prior to MTBDRplus performance. In addition, once MDR tuberculosis was reported, delays in contacting patients and initiating therapy require improvements in clinical infrastructure."}

Spontaneously expectorated sputum samples of 140 consecutive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were examined with direct fluorescence microscopy, Genotype MTBDRplus assay (MTBDR), Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert), and liquid mycobacterial culture. The methods detected mycobacteria or mycobacterial DNA in 96.8%, 90.5%, 92.9%, and 92.1% of samples, respectively. MTBDR, Xpert, and liquid culture were 100% concordant for detection of resistance to rifampin. Sensitivity and specificity of MTBDR for detection of isoniazid resistance were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. For quantification of mycobacterial sputum load, we found a correlation between Xpert DNA amplification cycle thresholds, time to positivity, and microscopy smear grade. The best correlation was found between Xpert and time to positivity (r = 0.54), which were both correlated with smear microscopy with r values equal to -0.40 and -0.48, respectively.

We assessed the clinical impact of routine DST using MTBDRplus in a single health district in South Africa. Data were collected on all adult pulmonary TB patients registered at 25 public health clinics in the periods before and after introduction of an expanded DST algorithm using MTBDRplus version 1.0. We collected data on 1176 TB patients before implementation and 1177 patients afterwards. In the before period, measured MDR-TB prevalence among new cases was 0.7% (95% CI1.4-3.1%), and among retreatment cases 6.2% (95% CI:3.5-8.8%), versus 3.7% (95% CI:2.4-5.0, p<0.01) and 6.6% (95% CI:3.8-9.4%, p\u200a=\u200a0.83) respectively after MTBDRplus introduction. The median times from sputum collection to MDR treatment in the before and after periods were 78 days (IQR:52-93) and 62 days (IQR:32-86, p\u200a=\u200a0.05), respectively. Among MDR-TB cases, 27% (95%CI:10-44) in the before period converted sputum cultures to negative by 8 months following treatment initiation, while 52% (95%CI:38-66) converted in the intervention period (p\u200a=\u200a0.04). The expanded use of MTBDRplus DST resulted in a substantial increase in the proportion of new cases identified as MDR-TB; though time to MDR treatment was reduced, it was still over two months. Culture conversion for MDR-TB patients improved after introduction of MTBDRplus.

Two hundred samples (100 mL each) were obtained from a dairy farm in the Nkonkobe region of South Africa. The samples were processed using the modified Petroff method. DNA was isolated using a Zymo Bacterial DNA kit and amplified using Seeplex(\u00ae) MTB Nested ACE assay. The Genotype(\u00ae) Mycobacterium tuberculosis-multidrug resistantplus (MTBDRplus) assay was used to perform drug susceptibility and detection of mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF). Eleven samples tested positive for MTBC DNA using the Seeplex(\u00ae) MTB Nested ACE assay. The Genotype(\u00ae) MTBDRplus assay showed that 10/11 samples were resistant to both INH and RIF i.e., multi-drug resistant (MDR). The most and least frequent rpoB mutations detected in RIF resistant samples were H526Y (9/10) and D516V (2/10) respectively. None of the INH resistant samples harbored mutations in the katG gene. However, all of them harbored the T8A mutation in the inhA gene. These results have clinical and epidemiological significance and calls for further studies and necessary actions to delineate the situation."}

An in-house IS6110 real-time PCR (IH IS6110), MTB Q-PCR Alert (Q-PCR) and GenoType MTBDRplus (MTBDR; Hain Lifescience) were compared for the direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in 87 specimens following automated NucliSENS easyMAG DNA extraction. This included 82 first smear-positive specimens and three smear-negative specimens. Another in-house real-time PCR with a Mycobacterium genus-specific probe for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (IH ITS) was used to allow a full comparison with culture results. The sensitivities of IH IS6110, Q-PCR, MTBDR and IH ITS for MTBC detection were 100, 92, 87 and 87\u200a%, respectively, compared with culture. Both IS6110-based real-time PCRs (in-house and Q-PCR) were similar in performance, with 91.2\u200a% concordant results for MTBC detection. Inhibition rates were low, with zero to three specimens producing uninterpretable results. However, the Q-PCR failed to detect MTBC in five samples that were smear negative or had few acid-fast bacilli (one to 10 bacilli in 10 microscopic fields) detected by IH IS6110. IH ITS was the least sensitive assay but may be useful when used in conjunction with IS6110 PCR results to determine the presence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in smear-negative specimens. None of the real-time PCR assays tested provided drug-resistance data. It was concluded that an IH IS6110 assay could easily be incorporated into the workflow of a diagnostic laboratory for rapid and accurate identification of MTBC from clinical specimens. The inclusion of an internal control and amplification of an ITS target enhance the diagnostic utility of the test."}

Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a growing problem in resource-limited settings. Adequate infrastructure for testing drug sensitivity and sufficient evidence of first-line resistance are currently unavailable in Nigeria. We collected sputum samples from HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Harvard PEPFAR/APIN Plus program over 12 months at two PEPFAR antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the southwest and north central regions in Nigeria. Smear-positive sputum samples were submitted for GenoType MTBDRplus testing (n = 415); mutations were confirmed through sequencing. Our results show high rates of DR-TB in Nigerian HIV-infected individuals (7.0% for rifampin [RIF] and 9.3% for RIF or isoniazid [INH]). Total RIF resistance indicative of MDR-TB in treatment-naive patients was 5.52%, far exceeding the World Health Organization predictions (0 to 4.3%). RIF resistance was found in 6/213 (2.8%) cases, INH resistance was found in 3/215 (1.4%) cases, and MDR-TB was found in 8/223 (3.6%) cases. We found significantly different amounts of DR-TB by location (18.18% in the south of the country versus 3.91% in the north central region [P < 0.01]). Furthermore, RIF resistance was genetically distinct, suggesting possible location-specific strains are responsible for the transmission of drug resistance (P < 0.04). Finally, GenoType MTBDRplus correctly identified the drug-resistant samples compared to sequencing in 96.8% of cases. We found that total DR-TB in HIV-infection is high and that transmission of drug-resistant TB in HIV-infected patients in Nigeria is higher than predicted."}

All isolates with rpoB mutations were sent to the New York State reference laboratory for conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). All isolates were also tested with the GenoType MTBDRplus line-probe assay. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from 906 patients. Twenty-six (2.9%) of the isolates had missense mutations or deletions in rpoB and were resistant to rifampin by DST. All 26 were also resistant to isoniazid and classified as MDR-TB. Forty-six control isolates without rpoB mutations were found to be rifampin sensitive by DST. The GenoType MTBDRplus line-probe assay correctly identified 26 MDR-TB strains.

The GenoType MTBDRplus assay was used to determine mutations associated with isoniazid and rifampicin resistance and their correlation with treatment outcomes. It was performed on a convenience sample comprising 88 onset and 67 fifth month isolates for which phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) was determined by the Buddemeyer technique for an earlier study. Simultaneous presence of wild type and mutant bands was referred to as \"mixed patterns\" (heteroresistance). Phenotypically 41 isolates were sensitive; 11 isoniazid, 2 rifampicin, 2 pyrazinamide and 5 ethambutol monoresistant; 16 polyresistant and 78 MDR. The agreement between both methods was excellent (kappa = 0.72-0.92).

Of the 64 rifampicin resistant fifth month isolates, the most frequent mutations were in WT8 (n = 31) with a further 9 showing the S531L mutation. Mixed patterns were seen in 22 (34%) isolates, most frequently for the D516V mutation (n = 21). Of the 22 onset and 35 fifth month katG mutants, 13 and 12 respectively showed the S315T1 mutation with loss of the WT. Mixed patterns involving both S315T1 and S315T2 were seen in 9 and 23 isolates respectively. Seventeen of 23 and 23/35 inhA mutant onset and fifth month isolates showed mixed A16G profiles. Additionally, 10 fifth month isolates lacked WT2. Five onset and 6 fifth month isolates had both katG and inhA mutations. An association was noted between only katG but not only inhA resistance and poor outcome (p = 0.037); and additional resistance to ethambutol (p = 0.0033). More fifth month than onset isolates had mixed profiles for at least 1 gene (p = 0.000001). The use of the assay to rapidly diagnose MDR could guide simultaneous first- and second-line DST, and reduce the delay in administering appropriate regimens.

For specimens positive for M. tuberculosis by MTBDRplus, this assay's sensitivity and specificity for rifampin resistance were 85.7% (95% CI, 57.2, 98.2) and 96.6% (95% CI, 93.2, 98.6) and for isoniazid resistance they were 62.1% (95% CI, 42.3, 79.3) and 97.9% (95% CI, 94.8, 99.4). For sputum testing, the sensitivity of MTBDRplus is directly related to the specimen's bacillary burden. Our results support recommendations that the MTBDRplus test not be used for direct testing of smear-negative or paucibacillary sputum samples."}

The sensitivity and specificity of the MTBDRsl assay were respectively 70.3% and 97.7% for OFX, 25.0% and 98.7% for KM, 21.2% and 98.7% for CPM and 56.3% and 56.0% for EMB. DNA sequencing identified mutations that were not detected by the MTBDRsl assay. The 8/11 phenotypically OFX-resistant isolates had mutations in gyrA (2/8 had an additional mutation in the gyrB gene), 1/11 had mutations only in the gyrB gene, 6/21 phenotypically KM-resistant isolates had mutations in the rrs gene, and 7/26 and 20/26 phenotypically CPM-resistant isolates had mutations in the rrs and tlyA genes. The MTBDRsl assay showed lower sensitivity than previous studies. The assay performed favourably for OFX; however, it was less sensitive in the detection of KM/CPM resistance and demonstrated low sensitivity and specificity for EMB resistance. It is recommended that the MTBDRsl assay include additional genes to achieve better sensitivity for all the drugs tested."}

A total of 34 clinical strains were characterized with the Bactec 460 TB system. Fifty-four clinical samples from 16 patients (5 were smear negative and 49 were smear positive) were also tested directly. The corresponding isolates of the clinical specimens were also analyzed with the Bactec 460TB. When there was a discrepancy between assays, pyrosequencing was performed. The overall rates of concordance of the MTBDRsl and the Bactec 460TB for the detection of FLQ, KM/CM, and EMB susceptibility in clinical strains were 72.4% (21/29), 88.8% (24/27), and 67.6% (23/34), whereas for clinical samples, rates were 86.5% (45/52), 92.3% (48/52), and 56% (28/50), respectively. In conclusion, the GenoType MTBDRsl assay may be a useful tool for making early decisions regarding KM/CM susceptibility and to a lesser extent regarding FLQ and EMB susceptibility. The test is able to detect mutations in both clinical strains and samples with a short turnaround time. However, for correct management of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, results must be confirmed by a phenotypical method."}

A total of 1,045 primary samples, 1045\u00a0TB cultures derived from these specimens and 306 separate M. tuberculosis isolates tested in 2007-2010 at four participating sites (Tartu, Estonia; Riga, Latvia; Vilnius, Lithuania; and Samara, Russian Federation) were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values for RIF and INH were 95.3% and 95.5%, 89.9 and 87.1%, respectively; there were no statistically significant variations in performance across sites. The proportion of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains in the collections ranged from 21.8% (in Estonia) to 55.9% (in Russia). In a routine non-trial context, the assay reliably detected both rifampicin and isoniazid resistance.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and causes high mortality and morbidity. Isoniazid resistance is strongly predictive of death in patients with TBM. In the present study, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Genotype MTBDRplus line-probe assay, we investigated the drug resistance in patients with TBM living in Southwest China. Our results showed that only one-third of patients with TBM had a positive result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PCR-based detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in CSF is not only an alternative diagnostic approach for TBM but also can be further used for the detection of drug resistance when combined with the MTBDRplus assay, the results of which were consistent with the classic drug susceptibility test. However, it further provided the molecular profile of the mutations can be conducted much faster than the classic drug susceptibility test can (1 day vs 30-40 days, respectively). In the studied 30 CSF samples from patients with TMB, we found a rate of 64.29% for isoniazid resistance, 39.29% for rifampicin resistance, and 32.14% for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, which is relatively higher than the reported resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis. However, the molecular profile indicated that the most frequently observed mutations in the rpoB and katG genes are also responsible for drug resistance in TBM. Our data suggest that the MTBDRplus line-probe assay is capable of detecting drug resistance for the CSF samples that have a PCR-positive result. We recommend PCR-based diagnosis and drug resistance test as routine assays for patients with suspected TBM."}

Drug susceptibility testing (DST) remains an important concern for implementing treatment of MDR tuberculosis patients. Implementation of molecular tests for drug resistance identification would facilitate DST particularly in developing countries where culturing is difficult to perform. We have characterized multidrug resistant strains in Cambodia using MDTDRsl tests, drug target sequencing and phenotypic tests. A total of 65 non-MDR and 101 MDR TB isolates collected between May 2007 and June 2009 were tested for resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides/cyclic peptides using the GenoType\u00ae MTBDRsl assay and gene sequencing. Rifampicin resistance (RMP-R) was tested using gene sequencing and genotyping was assessed by spoligotyping. A total of 95 of the 101 MDR strains were confirmed to be RMP-R by rpoB gene sequencing. Fourteen of the 101 MDR isolates (14%) carried a gyrA mutation associated with fluoroquinolone-resistance (FQ-R) (detected by the MTBDRsl assay and sequencing) compared with only 1 (1.5%) of the 65 non-MDR strains. Only 1 (1%) of the MDR isolates was found to be XDR TB. The MDR group contained a higher proportion of Beijing or Beijing like strains (58%) than the non MDR group (28%). This percentage is higher in MDR FQ-R strains (71%). The new GenoType\u00ae MTBDRsl assay combined with molecular tests to detect RMP-R and isoniazid resistance (INH-R) represents a valuable tool for the detection of XDR TB. In Cambodia there is a low rate of XDR amongst MDR TB including MDR FQ-R TB. This suggests a low association between FQ-R and XDR TB. Strain spoligotyping confirms Beijing strains to be more prone to accumulate antibiotic resistance."}

The specificity for RFP and INH was 100%. The sensitivity of GenoType MTBDRplus was almost equivalent to the sequencing method for RFP, but that for INH was slightly inferior to the sequencing without significant difference.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates tested at the Tanzanian Central TB Reference Laboratory (CTRL) were submitted for quality assurance of phenotypic DST to its supranational reference laboratory (SRL), together with ethanol-preserved sputum specimens for LPA DST. Only 321 samples could be tested using LPA; of these, three were identified as being non-tuberculous mycobacteria using CTRL DST. Both tests had 269 sets with interpretable results. CTRL DST yielded almost the same number of interpretable results as LPA, with 90% concordance (\u03ba = 0.612, P < 0.001). Five (1.9%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, 46 (17.1%) resistant to INH only and 0 RMP only, were found by CTRL DST. For the LPA, these results were respectively 5 (1.9%), 26 (9.7%) and 2 (0.7%). With SRL DST as the gold standard, LPA was more accurate than CTRL DST for RMP, but missed almost half the INH-resistant samples. LPA applied directly on ethanol-preserved sputum specimens was similar to phenotypic DST in terms of yield of interpretable results.

Among the 221 MTB isolates tested, 19 were resistant to isoniazid based on PM DST. The MTBDRplus assay identified 18 INH-resistant strains. Of these, 12 strains gave positive hybridization results with the mutation-specific probe katG Ser315Thr. The other six INH-resistant strains carried the mutation 15C\u2192T in the inhA promoter region. One INH-sensitive strain, as determined by PM DST, had a katG gene mutation. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of MTBDRplus for INH were 89.5, 99.5, 94.7 and 99%, respectively. The single rifampicin-resistant strain that was also the only multidrug resistance isolate gave a positive hybridization result with the mutation-specific probe MUT1: D516V, which confers resistance to rifampicin. Despite the advantages of MTBDRplus (turn-around time of only 1 working day) compared with PM DST, the latter is still required in every case of a MTB clinical isolate, as the molecular assay does not detect 100% of drug resistance, especially INH resistance."}

Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces, South Africa. To assess the potential association between the evolution of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mutations in the inhA promoter or the katG gene. Analysis of the frequency distribution of isoniazid (INH) resistance conferring mutations in a population sample of drug-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis. In the Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces, the percentage of isolates exhibiting inhA promoter mutations increased significantly from respectively 48.4% and 62.4% in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates to 85.5% and 91.9% in XDR isolates. Data from the Western Cape revealed that significantly more XDR-TB isolates showed mutations in the inhA promoter than in katG (85.5% vs. 60.9%, P < 0.01), while the respective proportions were equal for INH-resistant non-MDR-TB isolates (\u223c30%). inhA promoter mutations are strongly associated with XDR-TB in South Africa. We suggest that this is due to the dual resistance to ethionamide and (low-dose) INH conferred by inhA promoter mutations. The use of molecular probe assays such as the GenoType\u00ae MTBDRplus assay, which allows the detection of inhA promoter mutations, could enable treatment regimens to be adjusted depending on the pharmacogenetic properties of the mutations detected."}

The alarmingly worsening epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) call urgent need for a simple method for the rapid detection of drug-resistant TB in clinical settings. In an attempt to establish a rapid procedure for laboratory diagnosis of TB and investigate the local TB epidemiology, molecular line probe assay of the Genotype MTBDRplus was used to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and detect mutations conferring resistance to two most active first-line drugs against TB: Rifampin and Isoniazid. 96 acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear- positive sputums and 18 PCR-positive non-sputum specimens have been determined for the MTBC and resistance to Rifampin and Isoniazid. The MTBC detection rates in two sources of specimens were 93.8% (90/96) and 77.8% (14/18) respectively. The overall drug resistance (Rifampin or Isoniazid) occurred in 34.6% (36/104). Resistance to rifampin (RMP) was 28.8% (30/104) and 25% (26/104) was to Isoniazid (INH), in which high level drug resistance accounted for 88.5% (23/26) and low level drug resistance accounted for 7.7% (2/26). Multidrug resistance (MDR), defined as resistant to both RMP and INH, was found in 19.2% (20/104) of clinical samples, which was double that of official statistics. In addition, 63.3% (19/30) RMP-resistant mutations were identified in the region of RopB 530-533 and 57.9% (11/19) were the S531L mutation. 84.6% (22/26) of resistance to INH was mediated by Kat S315T1 mutations which conferred the high-level resistance to INH.

A reverse line blot DNA hybridization format for rapid detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was developed. Simultaneous detection of rifampin and isoniazid resistance in clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was based on the same amplification/reverse hybridization principle of the widely used spoligotyping. The test involved probing nine DNA regions that are targets of common drug resistance-associated mutations in the genes rpoB, katG, and inhA. Addition of quaternary amine tetramethyl ammonium chloride to the hybridization buffer promoted multiple hybrid formations at a single annealing temperature irrespective of the different GC contents of probes. The assay was standardized using 20 well-documented strains from the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium) and evaluated blindly in a central laboratory with 100 DNA samples that were obtained from cultured clinical isolates and shipped dried from three other countries. Compared with drug susceptibility testing, both sensitivity and specificity for rifampin resistance detection were 93.0% while for isoniazid the values were 87.7% and 97.7%, respectively. Compared with sequencing and GenoType MTBDRplus methods, sensitivity and specificity reached 96.4% and 95.5% for rifampin and 92.7% and 100% for isoniazid. Altogether, 40/45 (89%) multidrug-resistant isolates were correctly identified. Advantages of this in-house development include versatility, capacity to run up to 41 samples by triplicate in a single run, and reuse of the membrane at least 10 times. These features substantially reduce cost per reaction and make the assay an attractive tool for use in reference laboratories of countries that have a high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis but that cannot afford expensive commercial tests because of limited resources."}

The assay format is identical to the MTBDR Hain assay. The assay was evaluated for the detection of second-line-drug resistance in Vietnamese isolates using two sample sets from the microbiology department of Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, with existing conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility results for second-line drugs: 41 consecutive fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates and 21 consecutive multidrug-resistant but fluoroquinolone-sensitive isolates. The sensitivity for detection of fluoroquinolone resistance was 75.6% (31/41) (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 59.7% to 87.6%), and for kanamycin resistance, the sensitivity was 100% (5/5) (95% CI, 47.8% to 100%).

We performed a comparative study of the current gold standard in the Netherlands, the Middlebrook 7H10 agar dilution method, the MGIT960 system, and the GenoType MTBDRsl genotypic method for rapid screening of aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance. We selected 28 clinical multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis complex strains and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. We included amikacin, capreomycin, moxifloxacin, prothionamide, clofazimine, linezolid, and rifabutin in the phenotypic test panels. For prothionamide and moxifloxacin, the various proposed breakpoint concentrations were tested by using the MGIT960 method. The MGIT960 method yielded results 10 days faster than the agar dilution method. For amikacin, capreomycin, linezolid, and rifabutin, results obtained by all methods were fully concordant. Applying a breakpoint of 0.5 microg/ml for moxifloxacin led to results concordant with those of both the agar dilution method and the genotypic method. For prothionamide, concordance was noted only at the lowest and highest MICs. The phenotypic methods yielded largely identical results, except for those for prothionamide. Our study supports the following breakpoints for the MGIT960 method: 1 microg/ml for amikacin, linezolid, and clofazimine, 0.5 microg/ml for moxifloxacin and rifabutin, and 2.5 microg/ml for capreomycin. No breakpoint was previously proposed for clofazimine. For prothionamide, a division into susceptible, intermediate, and resistant seems warranted, although the boundaries require additional study.

The sensitivity of the assay was tested with 79 phylogenetically and geographically diverse M. tuberculosis isolates, including 42 drug-susceptible isolates and 37 RIF-resistant isolates containing 13 different rpoB mutations or mutation combinations. The specificity of the assay was tested with 89 nontuberculosis bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay correctly identified all 79 M. tuberculosis isolates and correctly excluded all 89 nontuberculosis isolates. RIF resistance was correctly identified in all 37 resistant isolates and in none of the 42 susceptible isolates. Dynamic range was assessed by adding 10(2) to 10(7) CFU of M. tuberculosis into M. tuberculosis-negative sputum samples. The assay showed a log-linear relationship between cycle threshold and input CFU over the entire concentration range. Resistance detection in the presence of different mixtures of RIF-resistant and RIF-susceptible DNA was assessed. Resistance detection was dependent on the particular mutation and required between 65% and 100% mutant DNA to be present in the sample for 95% certainty of resistance detection. Finally, we studied whether assay specificity could be affected by cross-contaminating amplicons generated by the GenoType MTBDRplus assay. M. tuberculosis was not detected until at least 10(8) copies of an MTBDRplus amplicon were spiked into 1 ml of sputum, suggesting that false-positive results would be unlikely to occur."}

A set of 41 multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis strains, 8 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis strains, and 3 non-MDR M. tuberculosis strains were tested by the MTBDRsl test and by DNA sequencing of the resistance-determining regions in gyrA and gyrB (fluoroquinolones [FQ]), rpsL (streptomycin), rrs and tlyA (aminoglycosides and/or cyclic peptide), and embB (ethambutol).

Analysis of the discrepant results indicated that three FQ-resistant strains (including one XDR strain) with mutations in gyrB were missed by the MTBDRsl test and that one FQ-susceptible strain, identified as resistant by the MTBDRsl test, had a double mutation (T80A-A90G) in GyrA that did not confer resistance to FQ. Five strains (including two XDR strains) without mutations in rrs were monoresistant to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide and were missed by the MTBDRsl test. Finally, 12/28 ethambutol-resistant strains had no mutation at codon 306 in embB, while 2/24 ethambutol-susceptible strains had such a mutation. In conclusion, the MTBDRsl test efficiently detects the most common mutations involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides/cyclic peptide, and ethambutol and accurately assesses susceptibility to amikacin. However, due to mutations not included in the test (particularly in gyrB) or resistance mechanisms not yet characterized (particularly those related to ethambutol resistance and to monoresistance to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide), the wild-type results yielded by the MTBDRsl test should be confirmed by drug susceptibility testing."}

We evaluated the molecular assay GenoType MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience, Germany) in order to detect DR-TB directly in clinical specimens as a means of providing a more accurate management of chronic TB patients in Burkina Faso, a country with a high TB-HIV co-infection prevalence. Samples were collected in Burkina Faso where culture and DST are not currently available, and where chronic cases are therefore classified and treated based on clinical evaluation and sputum-smear microscopy results. One hundred and eight chronic TB patients (sputum smear-positive, after completing a re-treatment regimen for pulmonary TB under directly observed therapy) were enrolled in the study from December 2006 to October 2008. Two early morning sputum samples were collected from each patient, immediately frozen, and shipped to Italy in dry ice. Samples were decontaminated, processed for smear microscopy and DNA extraction. Culture was attempted on MGIT960 (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, USA) and decontaminated specimens were analyzed for the presence of mutations conferring resistance to rifampin and isoniazid by the molecular assay GenoType MTBDRplus. We obtained a valid molecular test result in 60/61 smear-positive and 47/47 smear-negative patients. Among 108 chronic TB cases we identified patients who (i) harboured rifampin- and isoniazid-susceptible strains (n 24), (ii) were negative for MTB complex DNA (n 24), and (iii) had non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections (n 13). The most represented mutation conferring rifampin-resistance was the D516V substitution in the hotspot region of the rpoB gene (43.8% of cases). Other mutations recognized were the H526D (15.6%), the H526Y (15.6%), and the S531L (9.4%). All isoniazid-resistant cases (n 36) identified by the molecular assay were carrying a S315T substitution in the katG gene.

Infections with multidrug-resistant (resistant at least to rifampicin, RIF and isoniazid, INH) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are associated with high case fatality rates. Rapid identification' of MDR-TB strains is important for early institution of appropriate therapy. Two DNA line probe assays, GenoType MTBDR (GT-MTBDR) and INNO-LiPA Rif. TB (INNO-LiPA) were compared for their abilities to detect resistance to INH and RIF in 80 M. tuberculosis isolates. The test results were compared to those obtained by conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST), DNA sequencing and/or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of regions of interest of M. tuberculosis genome. Compared to the DST and katG codon 315 PCR-RFLP results, GT-MTBDR test results were concordant for INH resistance for 63 of 80 (78.7%) isolates. For RIF resistance, GT-MTBDR and INNO-LiPA test results were concordant with DST for 74 of 80 (92.5%) and 76 of 80 (95%) strains, respectively. The GT-MTBDR test results correlated with sequencing results for 77 of 80 (96.2%) while INNO-LiPA results for 79 of 80 (98.7%) isolates. Both the tests are useful for rapid detection of MDR-TB strains, however, GT-MTBDR assay offers the advantage of detecting the resistance to both INH and RIF simultaneously when MDR-TB is suspected."}

Rapid identification of resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates is quite important for the establishment of early and appropriate therapy. The Genotype MTBDR (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) is a commercially available DNA strip assay designed for the rapid detection of rpoB and katG gene mutations in clinical isolates. This study was conducted to determine the mutation types of phenotypically drug resistant 26 M. tuberculosis complex clinical isolates [15 isoniazid (INH), 1 rifampin (RMP) and 10 INH and RMP resistant] by Genotype MTBDR (G-MTBDR) DNA strip assay and to compare the diagnostic performance of this test. Sixteen of 25 (64%) INH-resistant and 9 of 11 (81.8%) RMP-resistant clinical isolates were correctly identified with the presence of hybridization in mutation probe or lack of hybridization at least by one of the wild type probes, by G-MTBDR assay. Hybridization with mutation probes was detected in only 5 of the RMP resistant isolates. We observed rpoB MUT3 (S531L, Ser-->4Leu) mutation in 4 and rpoB MUT1 (D516V) in one of these isolates. In 56% (14/25) of the INH-resistant isolates, katG T1 (S315T1) hybridization pattern was observed at katG mutation probe. G-MTBDR assay couldn't identify two of the 11 (18.2%) RMP-resistant isolates and one of these iSolates was shown to have a mutation at codon 531 (TCG-GCG) and the other at codon 545 (CTG-->ATG), possibly not associated with resistance, by sequence analysis. In four of the eight (8/25; 32%) INH-resistant isolates not identified by G-MTBDR assay, DNA cycle sequencing revealed different nucleotide changes outside the most common mutation zone. One of these were at codon 293 (GCT-->ACT) in katG, one with dual mutation at 279 (GGC-->ACC) in katG and at 15th C-->T in inhA gene, one at 15th C-->T in inhA gene and one at 279 (GGC-->ACC) in katG gene region. DNA membrane strip assay can be a use ful tool for the rapid detection of resistant M. tuberculosis complex isolates and therefore accelerate th initiation of the appropriate treatment. However, due to its restrictions in the determination of relatively rare mutations, this rapid screening test should be used together with conventional susceptibility tests in routine laboratory practices."}

To facilitate the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, two nucleic acid sequence-based methods, the GenoType MTBDRplus test and DNA sequencing, were assessed for the rapid detection of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis for the first time in the Asia-Pacific region. The performances of these two assays in detecting the presence of rifampin (rifampicin) (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance-associated mutations in the rpoB, katG, inhA regulatory region, inhA, and oxyR-ahpC genes were compared to that of a conventional agar proportion drug susceptibility test. A total of 242 MDR and 30 pansusceptible M. tuberculosis isolates were evaluated in this study. The sensitivities obtained for RIF-resistant detection by the GenoType MTBDRplus test and by resistance gene sequencing were 95.5% and 97.9%, respectively. The sensitivities for INH resistance detection by the GenoType MTBDRplus test and by resistance gene sequencing were 81.8% and 93.4%, respectively. Together, the sensitivity for MDR tuberculosis detection was 78.5% with the GenoType MTBDRplus test and 91.3% by resistance gene sequencing. The specificity for RIF resistance, INH resistance, and MDR detection was 100% by both methods. The GenoType MTBDRplus test has the advantage of a short turnaround time for drug-resistant M. tuberculosis detection. Overall, the two assays performed equally well in detecting RIF resistance (P = 0.13). However, DNA sequencing demonstrated superior performance in detecting INH resistance (P < 0.001) and MDR tuberculosis (P < 0.001). We suggest that new alleles of INH resistance genes should be evaluated to improve the sensitivity of the GenoType MTBDRplus test, especially for different geographic areas with genetically diverse M. tuberculosis strains."}

One of the challenges facing the tuberculosis (TB) control programmes in resource-limited settings is lack of rapid techniques for detection of drug resistant TB, particularly multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Results obtained with the conventional indirect susceptibility testing methods come too late to influence a timely decision on patient management. More rapid tests directly applied on sputum samples are needed. This study compared the sensitivity, specificity and time to results of four direct drug susceptibility testing tests with the conventional indirect testing for detection of resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid in M. tuberculosis. The four direct tests included two in-house phenotypic assays - Nitrate Reductase Assay (NRA) and Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility (MODS), and two commercially available tests - Genotype MTBDR and Genotype MTBDRplus (Hain Life Sciences, Nehren, Germany). A literature review and meta-analysis of study reports was performed. The Meta-Disc software was used to analyse the reports and tests for sensitivity, specificity, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves. Heterogeneity in accuracy estimates was tested with the Spearman correlation coefficient and Chi-square. Eighteen direct DST reports were analysed: NRA - 4, MODS- 6, Genotype MTBDR - 3 and Genotype MTBDRplus - 5. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for detection of resistance to rifampicin were 99% and 100% with NRA, 96% and 96% with MODS, 99% and 98% with Genotype MTBDR, and 99% and 99% with the new Genotype MTBDRplus, respectively. For isoniazid it was 94% and 100% for NRA, 92% and 96% for MODS, 71% and 100% for Genotype MTBDR, and 96% and 100% with the Genotype MTBDRplus, respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves was in ranges of 0.98 to 1.00 for all the four tests. Molecular tests were completed in 1 - 2 days and also the phenotypic assays were much more rapid than conventional testing.

Current anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drug sensitivity testing methods provide a dichotomous readout: isolates are reported as either drug susceptible or drug resistant. This report demonstrates that rapid molecular methods may provide information concerning both the level of resistance and cross-resistance to other anti-TB drugs that is important for optimal clinical management. Specific mutations detected by the Hain GenoType MTBDRplus test, recently approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) for rapid TB diagnosis and drug resistance testing, could inform the decision of whether to include high dose isoniazid (INH) when treating patients with INH mono-resistant TB, MDR-TB or XDR-TB. The presence of mutations in the inhA gene or promoter region generally confers low level INH resistance that can be overcome by high dose INH. The same mutations also confer resistance to ethionamide indicating little benefit from its inclusion in second line treatment regimens in such cases. This information has high clinical relevance since inhA mutations account for a large proportion of INH resistance, and optimized therapy regimens are crucial to improve patient outcomes and reduce the spread of drug resistant TB. This hypothesis needs to be tested in well controlled clinical and pharmacokinetic studies."}

A new version of the test, MTBDR plus, has been designed to also detect mutations in the regulatory region of inhA. To evaluate the performance of MTBDR plus over MTBDR. In 113 isolates, MTBDR plus detected all 76 RMP-resistant (RMP-R) strains and all 64 INH-resistant (INH-R) strains with KatG-315 mutations, 59 of which displayed a high level of INH resistance. It also identified 18 strains undetectable by MTBDR, without mutation in KatG-315 but with a -15 C-->T mutation in the regulatory region of inhA, of which 15 displayed a low level of INH resistance. Thirteen INH-R strains, which mainly harboured mutations in KatG at positions other than 315, were undetected by MTBDR plus. MTBDR plus retains the accuracy shown by MTBDR in detecting RMP resistance and is more sensitive in detecting INH resistance (86% vs. 67%), particularly at low levels (minimum inhibitory concentration<1 mg/l, 69% vs. 17%).

The presence of KatG S315T and inhA C-15T mutations that confer isoniazid resistance was determined using multiplex allele-specific PCR assays. The relationship between isolate lineage and resistance determinant was investigated by spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat analysis.

Heteroresistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is defined as the coexistence of susceptible and resistant organisms to anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs in the same patient. Heteroresistance of MTB is considered a preliminary stage to full resistance. To date, no mechanism causing heteroresistance of MTB has been proven. Clinical specimens and cultures from 35 TB patients from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, were analysed using the Genotype MTBDR assay (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany), which is designed to detect genetic mutations associated with resistance to rifampin and isoniazid. Cases of heteroresistance were further subjected to genotyping using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat typing, spoligotyping and IS6110 fingerprinting. Heteroresistance to rifampin and/or isoniazid was found in seven cases (20%). In five of them, heteroresistance was caused by two different strains and in two by a single strain of the Beijing genotype. The latter cases had a history of relapse of their TB. For the first time, two different mechanisms of heteroresistance in tuberculosis have been proven using a stepwise molecular-biological approach: 1) superinfection with two different strains, which is of interest for clinical infection control practitioners; and 2) splitting of a single strain into susceptible and resistant organisms. The latter mechanism is most likely to be related to poor treatment quality and could serve as a quality marker for tuberculosis therapy programmes in the future."}

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine (i) the sensitivity and accuracy of the Genotype MTBDR assay for the detection of MTBC strains and (ii) the ability of the assay to detect the presence of INH and RIF resistance-associated mutations in katG and rpoB from samples taken directly from smear-positive clinical specimens. The results were compared with those obtained with the reference BACTEC 460TB system combined with standard DNA sequencing analysis methods for katG, inhA, and rpoB. A total of 92 drug-resistant and 51 pansusceptible smear-positive specimens were included in the study. The Genotype MTBDR assay accurately and rapidly detected MTBC strains in 94.4% of the 143 specimens and showed a sensitivity of 94.4% for katG and 90.9% for rpoB when used directly on smear-positive specimens. The assay correctly identified INH resistance in 48 (84.2%) of the 57 specimens containing strains with resistance to high levels of INH (0.4 microg/ml) and RIF resistance in 25 (96.2%) of the 26 specimens containing RIF-resistant strains."}

We assessed the performance of the Genotype MTBDR line probe assay that offers the simultaneous identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its resistance to rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) by detecting the most commonly found mutations in the rpoB and katG genes. One hundred thirteen M. tuberculosis isolates were tested. The nucleotide sequences of the katG and inhA genes and the mabA-inhA promoter region were also determined. The MTBDR assay detected 100% and 67% (n = 64) of the strains resistant to RIF and INH, respectively. Among the latter, 62 strains carried a Ser315Thr mutation in katG, 59 of them displaying a high level of resistance to INH. Two strains with a low level of INH resistance had a Ser315Asn mutation. No mutation was found by the MTBDR assay for 31 INH-resistant strains (33%), of which 24 showed a low level of resistance. By DNA sequencing, we found among them various mutations in the KatG protein for 7 strains, a C-->T mutation in position -15 of the mabA-inhA promoter in 17 strains, and a Ser94Ala mutation in InhA for 7 strains. In conclusion, the MTBDR assay, which fits easily in the workflow of a routine laboratory, enabled the detection of 100% of the RIF-resistant strains and 89% of the INH-resistant strains with a high level of resistance but only 17% of the strains characterized by a low level of INH resistance, indicating that the test can be used as a rapid method to detect in the same experiment the rifampin-resistant and the high-level isoniazid-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis."}

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is associated with a high case fatality rate. Rapid identification of resistant strains is crucial for the early administration of appropriate therapy, for prevention of development of further resistance, and to curtail the spread of MDR strains. The Genotype MTBDR (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) is a reverse hybridization line probe assay designed for the rapid detection of rpoB and katG gene mutations in clinical isolates. The ability of this technique to correctly identify resistant and MDR-TB strains was tested on 206 isolates from the Italian drug resistance surveillance system. This panel included the majority of MDR strains isolated in Italy in the past 3 years. The results of the test were compared to conventional drug susceptibility test performed on isolated strains and verified by sequencing the regions of interest of the bacterial genome. The rate of concordance between the results of the MTBDR and those obtained with \"in vitro\" sensitivity was 91.5% (130 of 142) for rifampin and 67.1% (116 of 173) for isoniazid. We also applied this test directly to a panel of 36 clinical specimens collected from patients with active TB. The MTBDR correctly identified the two cases of MDR-TB included in the panel. These results show that the MTBDR test is useful in the detection and management of tuberculosis when MDR disease is suspected."}

A novel PCR-based reverse hybridization method Genotype MTBDR assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) was evaluated for rapid detection of rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) resistance in Turkish Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The Genotype MTBDR assay is designed to detect mutations within the 81-bp hotspot region of rpoB and mutations at katG codon 315. A total of 41 RIF-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates with rpoB mutations that were previously tested by the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB kit and also characterized by DNA sequencing were included in the study. Thirty-seven of these isolates were also resistant to INH. RIF resistance was correctly identified in 39 of 41 isolates (95.1%) with the Genotype MTBDR assay probes specific for these mutations. One isolate with a Gln-490-His mutation and another one with a CGG insertion between codons 514 and 515 were identified as RIF sensitive by the Genotype MTBDR assay. While the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB kit was able to determine the CGG insertion between codons 514 and 515, the Gln-490-His mutation outside the 81-bp hotspot region was not detected by the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB kit. These isolates had MICs of >or=32 microg/ml for RIF. The Genotype MTBDR assay also correctly identified 27 of 37 INH-resistant isolates (73%) with mutations in katG codon 315. In conclusion, the Genotype MTBDR assay may be useful for the rapid diagnosis of the most common mutations found in multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. However, the test results should always be confirmed with phenotypic methods."}

Two commercially available DNA line probe assays, Genotype MTBDR and INNO-LiPA Rif. TB, were evaluated for their abilities to detect resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) in 52 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The test results were compared to those obtained by phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and sequencing. Compared to the results of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing, the Genotype MTBDR test results were concordant for INH for 47 of the 52 (90.4%) isolates, and both the Genotype MTBDR and the INNO-LiPA Rif. TB test results were concordant for RIF for 51 of the 52 (98.1%) isolates. The Genotype MTBDR test results correlated with the sequencing results for 48 of the 52 (92.3%) isolates and the INNO-LiPA Rif. TB results for 50 of the 52 (96.2%) isolates. Both assays are useful for the rapid screening of M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from patients suspected of having multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but the GenoType MTBDR assay has the advantage of being able to detect resistance to both INH and RIF simultaneously."}

A commercially available DNA strip assay (Genotype MTBDR; Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) was evaluated for its ability to detect mutations conferring resistance to rifampin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH) in clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates. A total of 103 multidrug-resistant (MDR; i.e., at least resistant to RMP and INH) and 40 fully susceptible strains isolated in Germany in 2001 in which resistance mutations have been previously defined by DNA sequencing and real-time PCR analysis were investigated. The Genotype MTBDR assay identified 102 of the 103 MDR strains with mutations in the rpoB gene (99%) and 91 strains (88.4%) with mutations in codon 315 of katG. All 40 susceptible strains showed a wild-type MTBDR hybridization pattern. The concordance between the MTBDR assay and the DNA sequencing results was 100%. Compared to conventional drug susceptibility testing, the sensitivity and specificity were 99 and 100% for RMP resistance and 88.4 and 100% for INH resistance, respectively. In conclusion, the MTBDR assay is a rapid and easy-to-perform test for the detection of the most common mutations found in MDR M. tuberculosis strains that can readily be included in a routine laboratory work flow."}
