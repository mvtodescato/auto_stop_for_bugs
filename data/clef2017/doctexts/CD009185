To determine the incidence of renal scarring among patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and the possible risk factor(s), we studied 90 children (60 girls and 30 boys) with VUR followed in the Pediatric Nephrology Unit at the Ege University Hospital from 1998 to 2003. All the patients were assessed for VUR grade by voiding cystoureterography and for presence of renal scarring by (99 m) technetium dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy. All infants with VUR were given low-dose prophylactic antibiotics and followed-up until resolution of the reflux. Grade of reflux and number of urinary tract infection (UTI) episodes (\u22653) were found to be statistically significant risk factors for renal scarring (P <0.05). However, gender, familial history and laterality of the disease were not found to be statistically significant risk factors (P >0.05). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference of frequency of renal scarring among the different age groups (P >0.05). We conclude that recurrences of UTI and VUR severity are significant risk factors for renal scarring in children with VUR. Therefore, identification of VUR at an early age may offer the opportunity to prevent episodes of UTI and possible formation of renal scars that may result in end-stage renal failure."}

Bacterial infections increase mortality four-fold in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. However, specific mortality associated with urinary tract infections (UTI) in cirrhosis is not known. Retrospective single-centre analysis of all hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites who underwent first paracentesis between 2006 and 2011 to determine 90-day mortality associated with UTI defined as pyuria with significant bacteriuria using Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 108 patients with at least one episode of UTI and 291 with exclusion of UTI were identified. Bacterial infections other than UTI were diagnosed in 136 (34%) of patients at the time of urine analysis. Female gender, Child-Pugh stage C, higher grade of ascites and systemic inflammatory response syndrome were associated with UTI. After adjustment for liver function and co-morbidity, the hazard ratios (HR) of death within 90 days after urine analysis were 2.08 (95% CI 1.28-3.38) in patients with UTI, 2.93 (1.90-4.52) in patients with other bacterial infections and 3.39 (2.03-5.65) in patients with UTI and concomitant infection. Independent predictors of death after UTI were renal dysfunction at presentation (HR 2.52; 95% CI 2.52), subsequent acute kidney injury within 48 h after diagnosis (4.57; 2.54-8.24), concomitant bacterial infection (1.77; 1.04-3.00) and malignant comorbidity (1.85; 1.03-3.30). The combination of these factors was more accurate in predicting 90-day mortality than the MELD score or C-reactive protein. The presence of UTI indicates an increased risk of 90-day mortality in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Renal dysfunction and comorbidities are predictors of death in these patients."}

Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous chronic disease, and no therapeutic agent has been identified which is universally and persistently effective in all patients. We investigated the effectiveness of tofacitinib (CP-690,550), a novel oral Janus kinase inhibitor, as a targeted immunomodulator and disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. We did a 6-month, double-blind, parallel-group phase 3 study at 82 centres in 13 countries, including North America, Europe, and Latin America. 399 patients aged 18 years or older with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1:1 ratio with an automated internet or telephone system to receive twice a day treatment with: tofacitinib 5 mg (n=133); tofacitinib 10 mg (n=134); or placebo (n=132), all with methotrexate. At month 3, patients given placebo advanced to either tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day (n=66) or 10 mg twice a day (n=66).

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common sources of bacterial infections among young febrile children. Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) are important because of their association with renal scarring, sometimes leading to long-term complications. However, the gold standard examinations are either a DMSA scan for APN and scarring, or cystography for VUR, but both present limitations (feasibility, pain, cost, etc.). Procalcitonin, a reliable marker of bacterial infections, was demonstrated to be a good predictor of renal parenchymal involvement in the acute phase and in late renal scars, as well as of high-grade VUR. These findings need further broad validations and impact studies before being implemented into daily practice. However, procalcitonin may play a role in the complex and still debated picture of which examination should be performed after UTI in children."}

In many bacteria, the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) interacts with the transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP), forming active cAMP-CRP complexes that can control a multitude of cellular activities, including expanded carbon source utilization, stress response pathways, and virulence. Here, we assessed the role of cAMP-CRP as a regulator of stress resistance and virulence in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the principal cause of urinary tract infections worldwide. Deletion of genes encoding either CRP or CyaA, the enzyme responsible for cAMP synthesis, attenuates the ability of UPEC to colonize the bladder in a mouse infection model, dependent on intact innate host defenses. UPEC mutants lacking cAMP-CRP grow normally in the presence of glucose but are unable to utilize alternate carbon sources like amino acids, the primary nutrients available to UPEC within the urinary tract. Relative to the wild-type UPEC isolate, the cyaA and crp deletion mutants are sensitive to nitrosative stress and the superoxide generator methyl viologen but remarkably resistant to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and acid stress. In the mutant strains, H(2)O(2) resistance correlates with elevated catalase activity attributable in part to enhanced translation of the alternate sigma factor RpoS. Acid resistance was promoted by both RpoS-independent and RpoS-dependent mechanisms, including expression of the RpoS-regulated DNA-binding ferritin-like protein Dps. We conclude that balanced input from many cAMP-CRP-responsive elements, including RpoS, is critical to the ability of UPEC to handle the nutrient limitations and severe environmental stresses present within the mammalian urinary tract."}

Pyelonephritis in childhood may, in the worst cases, lead to long-term cardiovascular morbidity due to tubulointerstitial renal scarring. Renal damage is the end result of an interplay between (1) urinary tract anatomy and function, (2) bacterial virulence factors, and (3) the host innate immune system, which on the one hand manages bacterial clearance, but on the other causes tubulointerstitial inflammation, which underlies the renal scarring. It is unclear how common postpyelonephritic scarring is, and how many of the \"scars\" in fact represent congenital renal hypoplasia. We do, however, know that some situations have an increased risk for scars, i.e., large renal-uptake defects on initial renal scintigraphy or pyelonephritis in young girls with dilating vesicoureteral reflux. It seems logical that antiinflammatory or antioxidant therapy given concomitantly with antibiotics should lower the risk of postpyelonephritic scarring. Animal studies give some support to this idea, but research on humans has been surprisingly scant. In this issue of Pediatric Nephrology, we publish a study that indicates that antioxidant therapy with vitamin A or E given to children with pyelonephritis may indeed lower the risk for renal scarring. This is a track that needs to be pursued further."}

BDNF levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 42 patients admitted during 5-year period, due to CNS infections, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Control samples were collected from 108 patients with non-CNS infections (urinary tract infection, acute upper respiratory infection, acute gastroenteritis, etc.). Mean values of BDNF levels, at various ages, were determined and compared. BDNF levels were below the sensitivity of the ELISA in most CSF samples from the control group, but were significantly elevated in the patients with bacterial meningitis. The serum BDNF levels were elevated in all subgroups of patients with CNS infections, and the elevation was particularly notable in those with bacterial meningitis. BDNF expression in the CSF was correlated with CSF interleukin (IL)-6 levels as well as with blood platelet counts and neurological prognoses in those with bacterial meningitis. No correlation was found between BDNF levels and serum leukocyte numbers or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. BDNF levels were found to be elevated in the serum and CSF of pediatric patients with CNS infections, particularly those with bacterial meningitis. Monitoring the changes in serum and CSF levels of BDNF may facilitate the diagnosis of acute meningitis and acute encephalopathy and allow the differential diagnosis of specific CNS infections."}

Of 120 proven infections, 31 episodes (25.8%) occurred in patients taking no corticosteroids (CS). The risk of infection was lower in patients taking low-dose CS (< 300 mg prednisolone/month) than no CS (odds ratio (OR) 0.36). In patients receiving high-dose CS (> 1000 mg prednisolone/month), however, the risk increased (OR 2.9). In patients taking no CS, disease activity manifested as increased SLEDAI, anemia and active urinary sediment, was associated with infection. The CRP was higher in the patients with infection than controls and the CRP levels over 50 mg/l were observed only in infection. These results suggest that CS have a bimodal influence on infection depending on dose. Disease activity is an important risk factor for infection in patients taking no CS. Finally, CRP levels greater than 50 mg/l suggest the presence of infection."}

PET was repeated after therapeutic intervention when disease remission was achieved. PET findings were compared with angiography, MRA and clinical parameters. PET visualised inflamed arteries in all 5 patients, but there was a discrepancy between PET and angiography or MRA. In 8 arteries of 4 patients only PET showed disease involvement, while in 5 arteries of 2 patients only angiography or MRA showed involvement. After treatment and the disappearance of clinical symptoms, FDG uptake was clearly reduced compared to the initial scan in all patients. In all but one the acute phase response declined. In that patient a urinary tract infection explained the elevated acute phase response, as this normalised after antibiotic treatment. PET is a promising new technique for the diagnosis of large vessel vasculitides. Furthermore, PET appears to be a valuable tool for the assessment of disease activity during follow-up and of the response to therapy."}

Early predictors for the development of stroke-associated infection may identify patients at high risk and reduce post-stroke infection and mortality. In 383 prospectively enrolled acute stroke patients we assessed time point and type of post-stroke infections (i.e. pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI) other infection (OI)). Blood samples were collected on admission, and days 1, and 3 to assess white blood cells (WBC), monocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and copeptin. To determine the magnitude of association with the development of infections, odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each prognostic blood marker. The discriminatory ability of different predictors was assessed, by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Prognostic models including the three parameters with the best performance were identified. Of 383 patients, 66 (17.2%) developed an infection after onset of stroke. WBC, CRP, copeptin and PCT were all independent predictors of any infection, pneumonia and UTI developed at least 24 hours after measurements. The combination of the biomarkers WBC, CRP and copeptin (AUC: 0.92) and WBC, CRP and PCT (AUC: 0.90) showed a better predictive accuracy concerning the development of pneumonia during hospitalization compared to each marker by itself (p-Wald <0.0001). Among ischemic stroke patients, copeptin, PCT, WBC and CRP measured on admission were predictors of infection in general, and specifically for pneumonia and UTI within 5 days after stroke. The combination of these biomarkers improved the prediction of patients who developed an infection."}

A total of 132 patients, with male predominance (68.9%), were enrolled. The top three pathogens were similar to those identified in previous studies in Taiwan. The most common pathogen, Escherichia coli (85.3%), was resistant to ampicillin (75.9%), followed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (31.7%), and cefazolin (28.5%). Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan revealed 34.5% positive findings, while the vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) rate was 37.8% by direct radionuclide voiding cystography and/or voiding cysto-urethrography. Positive DMSA findings significantly correlated with VUR (p<0.001) and higher C-reactive protein level (p<0.05). E coli was the most common pathogen in the present cohort, and the top three pathogens were similar to those found in general pediatric population in Taiwan. VUR was the most common genitourinary tract anomaly in this age group. Positive DMSA was well correlated with VUR and higher C-reactive protein level."}

Twenty-two consecutive SCI (15 paraplegic and 7 tetraplegic) patients (mean age: 49.1\u00b113.4 years) who had no urinary symptoms participated in this prospective study. The mean duration of injury was 45.6\u00b148.8 months before. Sixteen patients had at least one urinary tract infection history. Renal cortical scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-DMSA, radionuclide renography with (99m)Tc-DTPA and renal ultrasound were performed within 2-week period. Four (18%) patients had serious pathology on their kidneys such as unilateral or bilateral parenchymal scarring and increased background uptake in their renal cortical scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-DMSA. Two of them had grade 3-4 pelvicaliceal ectasia on ultrasound. Additionally, 2 of 18 remaining patients had grade 2 pelvicaliceal ectasia on ultrasound. Sixteen (73%) patients had markedly delayed or delayed and decreased functions of one or both of kidneys on radionuclide renography. However, only four patients had grade 2-4 pelvicaliceal ectasia and none of them had a finding of loosening of renal parenchyma. Combined use of renal cortical scintigraphy and radionuclide renography appears to be contributive to renal ultrasound in the long-term follow-up of patients with SCI. Patients with abnormal findings should be closely followed, and early therapeutic interventions may enable lower morbidity and mortality rates in these patients."}

Approximately 4%-10% of incident patients on dialysis have a non-functioning kidney graft, and according to series, as many as 32% require transplantectomy for a variety of reasons. Mortality in these patients is significantly higher than in those with a functioning graft or on renal replacement therapy without having received a graft. Graft intolerance syndrome, early graft loss, severe proteinuria, recurring pyelonephritis or neoplasia, and chronic inflammation syndrome have all been proposed as indications for transplantectomy. Chronic inflammation syndrome occurs in patients with high levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein), anaemia resistant to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulators, and malnutrition markers. This inflammatory state is provoked by the graft, and reverts when a transplantectomy is performed, as several studies have shown. We have reviewed the medical literature published on this topic, the indications for transplantectomy and embolectomy, their advantages and disadvantages, the incidence of graft intolerance syndrome, and the pathophysiology of chronic inflammation syndrome, as well as the currently proposed therapeutic management algorithm."}

We compared the sensitivities of the top-down ((99m)technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan to screen) and biomarker based (C-reactive protein level at presentation) approaches in identifying children with vesicoureteral reflux. We calculated the sensitivity of the 2 screening approaches in detecting vesicoureteral reflux and subsequently high grade (III or greater) vesicoureteral reflux in children. The top-down and C-reactive protein based approaches missed 33% and 29% of cases of high grade vesicoureteral reflux, respectively. The sensitivity of the top-down approach for detecting high grade vesicoureteral reflux was lower than previously reported.

We also evaluated the ability of MR-proADM and PCT to predict hospitalization. This was an observational, multicentric study. We enrolled 128 patients referred to the ED with high fever and a suspicion of severe infection such as sepsis, lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, soft tissue infections, central nervous system infections, or osteomyelitis. The APACHE II score was calculated for each patient. MR-proADM median values in controls were 0.5\u2009nmol/l as compared with 0.85\u2009nmol/l in patients (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), while PCT values in controls were 0.06\u2009ng/ml versus 0.56\u2009ng/ml in patients (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). In all patients there was a statistically significant stepwise increase in MR-proADM levels in accordance with PCT values (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). MR-proADM and PCT levels were significantly increased in accordance with the Apache II quartiles (P\u2009<\u20090.0001 and P\u2009=\u20090.0012 respectively).In the respiratory infections, urinary infections, and sepsis-septic shock groups we found a correlation between the Apache II and MR-proADM respectively and MR-proADM and PCT respectively. We evaluated the ability of MR-proADM and PCT to predict hospitalization in patients admitted to our emergency departments complaining of fever. MR-proADM alone had an AUC of 0.694, while PCT alone had an AUC of 0.763. The combined use of PCT and MR-proADM instead showed an AUC of 0.79. The present study highlights the way in which MR-proADM and PCT may be helpful to the febrile patient's care in the ED. Our data support the prognostic role of MR-proADM and PCT in that setting, as demonstrated by the correlation with the APACHE II score. The combined use of the two biomarkers can predict a subsequent hospitalization of febrile patients. The rational use of these two molecules could lead to several advantages, such as faster diagnosis, more accurate risk stratification, and optimization of the treatment, with consequent benefit to the patient and considerably reduced costs."}

Laboratory examinations [white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum sodium concentration], renal ultrasonography, (99m)Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, and voiding cystourethrogram were performed. Culture growing >50,000 colonies of one single bacterial species on a urine sample obtained by catheter or >100,000 colonies on two clean-catch samples was required to establish diagnosis of UTI. In children with renal cortical defects diagnosed after DMSA scintigraphy (group 1), duration of fever was significantly longer (P = 0.038) and WBC (P = 0.047) and CRP (P < 0.0001) levels significantly higher than in those without renal cortical defects (group 2). However, serum sodium levels were significantly lower in group 1 than group 2 (135.9 \u00b1 2.4 vs 137.4 \u00b1 2.7 mEq/L, P = 0.007). Hyponatremia (serum sodium \u2264 135 mEq/L) was also more frequent in group 1 than in group 2 (74.1 % vs 45.3 %, P = 0.012). Serum sodium concentration was negatively correlated with WBC count (r = -0.156, P = 0.011) and CRP levels (r = -0.160, P= 0.028).

Ours was a cross-sectional retrospective study in which the clinical histories of 179 paediatric patients (91 male and 88 female) were evaluated. In 102 of these patients (57%), a scintigraphy revealed loss of parenchyma. The most commonly observed morphological type of damage was renal scarring. All patients had undergone at least one desmopressin urine concentration test. We also analysed albumin/creatinine and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG)/creatinine ratios, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urine volume. By distributing patients according to normal/abnormal scintigraphy, we observed statistically significant differences between the two groups in maximum urine osmolality and GFR. Urine volume was elevated in 31.3% of cases (sensitivity: 37.9%; specificity: 81.8%) and 24% had a defect in renal concentrating ability (sensitivity: 30.4%; specificity: 84.8%). Urinary albumin excretion was high in 12.2% of patients, and 7.2% had a high NAG/creatinine ratio. GFR was low in only 5.7% of patients. These last two markers were the least sensitive but most specific for detecting a loss of renal parenchyma (100%). In our study, the most sensitive functional tests for detecting the loss of renal parenchyma were the two that take into account the ability of the kidney to manage water, i.e. urine volume and maximum urine osmolality. These two tests had specificity >80%. However, the maximum specificity was obtained by the NAG/creatinine ratio and GFR, which were, conversely, the least sensitive tests. A normal GFR does not necessarily show normal renal function."}

Frequency of vesicoureteral reflux was found to be significantly lower in patients with mild HN (6%) as compared to patients with severe AHN (29%) (p = 0.005). In addition, the risk of urinary tract infection increases with increasing grades of HN (10% vs. 29%, p = 0.006). The frequency of spontaneous resolution in patients with mild AHN (64%) was also significantly higher than in patients with severe HN (29%) (p < 0.001). The degree of AHN can be used for making decision about further diagnostic imaging and treatment. Our results strongly suggest that low-grade HN is a relatively self-limited condition and needs minimal investigation. In contrast, the outcome of more severe degrees of AHN needs clarification."}

We recorded demographic characteristics, intraoperative parameters, and changes 24 hours postoperatively in systemic inflammatory and immunologic values (body temperature, concentrations of white blood cell count [WBC], C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin [IL]-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1), and compared the mean changes between groups. Mean age was older in the LN group (45.6 vs 30.9 years; P<0.0001), and mean operative time was significantly shorter (83.1 min vs 101.6 min; P=0.004). Mean postoperative increase in IL-6 and body temperature in LN was significantly less than in control: For IL-6, 15.87 vs 29.09 pg/mL, P=0.03; for body temperature, +0.22\u00b0C vs +0.71\u00b0C, P=0.001). Mean postoperative increases in levels of other inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-\u03b1, WBC) did not differ significantly. No statistical correlation was found between operative time and changes in IL-6, CRP, TNF-\u03b1, WBC, or body temperature. Based on the smaller increase in serum IL-6 as the most important indicator of surgical stress, the surgical trauma-induced immune dysfunction may be less intense after LN than open surgery. This may explain the smooth convalescence after LN."}

A total of 197 consecutive women with non-stress urinary incontinence (non-SUI) LUTS and 18 healthy women without LUTS (normal controls) were enrolled. LUTS include urinary storage, voiding, and post-micturition symptoms. Patients with previous bladder or urethral surgery, active urinary tract infections, or possible neurogenic lesions were excluded. Serum CRP levels were measured before any treatment was given. Patients were stratified to LUTD subgroups based on a 3-day voiding diary, uroflowmetry, and selective videourodynamic studies. Median CRP levels were significantly higher in women with overactive bladder (OAB) wet (i.e., with urgency incontinence, n = 30, 0.12 mg/dl) than those in women with bladder oversensitivity (n = 68, 0.075 mg/dl, P = 0.008) and the control group (0.055 mg/dl, P = 0.032). Further analysis revealed that body mass index and maximum flow rate were two independent factors that affected CRP levels. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for using CRP to predict OAB wet was 0.55, and the most predictive cutoff point for CRP was 0.15 mg/dl (sensitivity 43.5 %, specificity 72.7 %). High serum CRP levels were found in women with OAB wet, and they were related to lower maximum urinary flow rates and higher body mass indices in non-SUI LUTD. However, serum CRP is not a suitable biomarker for discriminating between subtypes of non-SUI LUTD."}

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) contributes to renal fibrogenesis in several manners such as increasing collagen synthesis in mesangium, decreasing extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation by mesangial cells and stimulating mesangial contraction. The aim of our study was to investigate whether urine level of ET-1 (uET-1) could represent a useful biomarker of renal scarring and if so, to determine the optimal cutoff level for uET-1 to predict a renal scar. 44 children with renal scarring and 32 children without renal scarring were enrolled in the study. Urine ET-1 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mean uET-1 level was significantly higher in the scar group than in controls (2.75 \u00b1 1.35 fmol/ml vs. 0.68 \u00b1 0.41 fmol/ml, p = 0.001). The optimal cut-off level was 1.064 fmol/ml for uET-1 to predict renal scarring. Using this cut-off point, sensitivity and specificity were 97.73% and 93.91%, respectively. AUC was found 0.975 (95% CI 0.917 - 0.996) for uET-1. Mean urine Endothelin-1/Creatinine ratio (uET-1/Cr) was also significantly higher in the scar group than in the control group (4.04 \u00b1 2.29 fmol/mg Cr vs. 1.09 \u00b1 0.67 fmol/mg Cr, p = 0.0001).

Our study suggests that both uET-1 and uET-1/Cr can be used for prediction of renal scarring in children with normal renal function. Measuring urine level of ET-1 can help us to avoid unnecessary DMSA studies if the patient's uET-1 level is found to be under the determined cut-off point."}

The lack of good evidence for improved outcomes in children and young infants with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) after aggressive treatment for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has raised doubts regarding the need for routine voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and the appropriate imaging evaluation in these children remains controversial. This prospective study aimed to determine whether abnormalities found on acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and ultrasound (US) can help indicate the necessity of voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in young infants. For 3.5 years, all infants younger than 3 months presenting with first febrile UTI were prospectively studied. All infants were hospitalized and investigated using US (<3 days after admission), DMSA scan (<5 days after admission), and VCUG (7-10 days after antibiotic treatment) after diagnosis. The association among findings of US, DMSA scan, and VCUG were evaluated. From 220 infants, there were abnormal results in 136 (61.8%) US and in 111 (50.5%) DMSA scans. By US, ten infants (4.5%) with abscess or structural abnormalities other than VUR were diagnosed. High-grade (III-V) VUR was present in 39 patients (17.7%). The sensitivities for high-grade VUR of renal US alone (76.9%) or DMSA scan alone (82.1%) were not as good as that of the \"OR rule\" strategy, which had 92.3% sensitivity and 94.3% negative predictive value. To screen high-grade VUR in young infants with febrile UTI, US and acute DMSA scan could be performed first. VCUG is only indicated when abnormalities are apparent on either US or DMSA scan or both."}

DMSA scans were obtained 4-6 months after the last episode of pyelonephritis in all patients. A total of 80 children with acute pyelonephritis were enrolled in this study. Most of them were girls (77.5%), with a median age of 12 months. Nearly half of the children (n = 44; 55%) had one or more renal scars. The distribution of gender, CRP level and leukocytosis did not differ significantly regarding the absence or presence of renal scars (p > 0.05). Most of the scars occurred in children who had presented with bilateral pyelonephritis (69.4% vs. 18.2%, p = 0.001).

In this study we evaluated the results and safety of laparoscopic heminephrectomy in our consecutive cases. From February 2001 to May 2007 fourteen unilateral laparoscopic heminephrectomy were performed in our center. Patients' characteristics, presenting symptoms, operative time, and blood loss, early and late complications were all collected retrospectively. Using pre-operative ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography (IVP) and CT scanning, unilateral upper pole hydronephrosis was detected in all cases. By DMSA isotope scan hypofunctioning of ipsilateral moieties was detected in all cases. Mean operative time was 203\u00b180 minutes. No major intra-operative or early complications were identified. Mean hospital stay was 4.1 days. On mean follow-up of 32 months no disturbing symptoms or episodes of urinary tract infections (UTIs) were detected. Atrophic kidney was detected in one case in post-operative IVP. Laparoscopic heminephrectomy is a valuable minimal invasive procedure that can be performed safely in experienced hands without any important complication.

In 98 patients, either urine or blood cultures were negative, but CT/NMR were positive for APN. Fifty of the 213 patients submitted to CT/NMR (23.5%) had intrarenal abscesses: only 2 were evidenced by ultrasound examination. No differences were found between patients with positive or negative CT with regards to fever, leucocytosis, C-reactive protein, pyuria, urine cultures and duration of symptoms before hospitalization. No differences were found between patients with or without abscesses with regards to these parameters and risk factors. Patients with abscesses had a longer duration of treatment and hospitalization. Our data suggest that in APN it is not always possible to routinely document urinary infection in a clinical setting. This finding could be explained by previous antibiotic treatment, low bacterial growth or atypical pathogens. Systematic CT or NMR is necessary to exclude evolution into abscesses, which cannot be suspected on clinical grounds or by ultrasound examination and may also develop in the absence of risk factors."}

Staff and faculty members openly discussed the pattern of requests in the hospital and related current medical literature. During 2010, the medical staff worked as multipliers to change the behaviour of new students and residents. The results of the first 4 months after the intervention were presented at another general meeting in July 2010. From 2007 to 2009, there were 11,786 CRP measurement requests with a clear exponential trend. After the intervention, during the calendar year 2010, there was a 48% reduction in adjusted annual CRP requests.

Early recognition and therapy of UTI and detection of risk factors offer chances for applying strategies to avoid renal damage and recurrences. However, established diagnostic strategies and prophylactic concepts today are under debate. Currently, the main focus has been on renal changes as indicators for underlying risk factors like vesicoureteral reflux, attaching much importance to dimercaptosuccinyl acid scans. Serum and urine markers will probably allow more restrictive diagnostic imaging. Prenatal and postnatal ultrasound screenings provide additional opportunities for prophylactic measures. Main objectives in the management of neonatal UTIs are the prevention of acute infection-related complications and renal damage. Neonates and very young infants with suspicious pyelonephritis should obligatorily be treated with a combination of parenterally administered antibiotics. As far as possible, diagnostic imaging should be risk-oriented and restricted to noninvasive, nonstressful procedures. The strategies of antibacterial prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrent UTIs are changing. In infants at risk, its benefits have not yet been proven by evident data."}

Predicting reflux grade III or higher would make it possible to restrict cystography to high risk cases. We aimed to derive a clinical decision rule to predict vesicoureteral reflux grade III or higher in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. We conducted a secondary analysis of prospective series including all children with a first febrile urinary tract infection from the 8 European participating university hospitals. A total of 494 patients (197 boys, reflux grade III or higher in 11%) were included. Procalcitonin and ureteral dilatation on ultrasound were significantly associated with reflux grade III or higher and then combined into a prediction model with an ROC AUC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.69-0.81). Given the prespecified constraint of achieving at least 85% sensitivity, our model led to the clinical decision rule, for children with a first febrile urinary tract infection cystography should be performed in cases with ureteral dilatation and serum procalcitonin level 0.17 ng/ml or higher, or without ureteral dilatation (ie ureter not visible) when serum procalcitonin level is 0.63 ng/ml or higher. The rule had 86% sensitivity (95% CI 74-93) with 47% specificity (95% CI 42-51). Internal cross-validation produced 86% sensitivity (95% CI 79-93) and 43% specificity (95% CI 39-47). A clinical decision rule was derived to enable a selective approach to cystography in children with urinary tract infection.

TDT was the risk factor associated with ASL and USF along with presence of VUR. TDT was longer in ASL positive group compared with the ASL negative group. Also USF group showed longer TDT compared with those without USF in both refluxing UTI and non refluxing UTI. The TDT was significantly shorter in USF group with the presence of VUR. Positive linear association was noted between prevalence of ASL and USF and duration of TDT.

The aim of this study was to estimate the value of identifying vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and the benefit of VUR management according to imaging strategies at the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). Children aged 1-144 months (n = 618) with the first febrile UTI admitted at our hospital from 2000 to 2009 were enrolled. In all patients, renal sonogram (US), (99m) Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scanning and VCUG were performed. Retrospective analyses per patient and per renal unit were performed. Abnormal US or DMSA scans had a sensitivity of 100% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% to detect high-grade reflux. In hydronephrotic kidneys, DMSA scanning had a sensitivity of 88.2% and a NPV of 97.1% to detect high-grade reflux. Routine VCUG is not required after the first febrile UTI in patients with normal US or normal DMSA scan. Even if the US reveals hydronephrosis, routine VCUG is not necessary if the DMSA findings are normal. It is recommended that children who did not receive both a DMSA scan and VCUG after the first febrile UTI should be followed up over the long term."}

Although C-reactive protein (CRP) can be measured by a standard blood test, its diagnostic value for distinguishing patients with inflammatory complications after pancreatic surgery from patients with normal postoperative inflammatory responses has not been adequately investigated. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CRP levels for the occurrence of postoperative inflammatory complications after pancreatic surgery. Clinical data and CRP levels measured in 280 patients after pancreatic surgeries (performed between 1998 and 2010) until postoperative day 10 (POD 10) were retrospectively analyzed. Using the receiver operating characteristic method, diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by an area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Furthermore, the results of the present study were compared to previously published reports by applying diagnostic meta-analysis techniques. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.9% (95% CI 2.1-7.0%). Inflammatory complications occurred in 153 of 280 patients (54.6%; 95% CI 48.8-60.4%). On POD 4, the AUC was 0.67 (95% CI 0.58-0.76). The highest diagnostic accuracy was observed on POD 7 (AUC 0.77; 95% CI 0.68-0.85). In a diagnostic meta-analysis that included two additional studies, the diagnostic sensitivity on POD 4 was 0.63 (95% CI 0.50-0.76), and the specificity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.88). The highest sensitivity occurred on POD 6 (0.75; 95% CI 0.68-0.82). Considerable statistical heterogeneity was observed in the analysis of PODs 3, 4 and 5. According to this limited evidence, CRP levels had a low to moderate diagnostic accuracy. Large, blinded studies are warranted for a more precise estimation of CRP's diagnostic value."}

BACKGROUND. The traditional initial imaging approach following pediatric urinary tract infection is the \"bottom-up\" approach (cystogram and renal ultrasound). Recently, the \"top-down\" approach (nuclear renal scan followed by cystogram for abnormal scans only) has gained increasing attention. The relative cost and radiation doses of these are unknown METHODS. The authors used a decision model to evaluate these imaging approaches. Cost and effective radiation dose estimates, including sensitivity analyses, were based on one-time imaging only. RESULTS. Comparing hypothetical cohorts of 100 000 children, the top-down imaging approach cost $82.9 million versus $59.2 million for the bottom-up approach. Per-capita effective radiation dose was 0.72 mSv for top-down compared with 0.06 mSv for bottom-up. CONCLUSIONS. Routine use of nuclear renal scans in children following initial urinary tract infection diagnosis would result in increased imaging costs and radiation doses as compared to initial cystogram and ultrasound. Further data are required to clarify the long-term clinical implications of this increase."}

Although several studies suggested that measuring serum PCT levels may serve as a useful marker to distinguish between active antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated diseases and invasive infections, there is no information on PCT in myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. The authors measured serum PCT concentrations before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy in 67 patients with biopsy-proven MPO-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. The authors compared complications and clinicopathological parameters between patients with serum PCT levels of <0.5 ng/mL (group A: 58 patients) and \u22650.5 ng/mL (group B: 9 patients). All 58 patients in group A did not show any clinical sign of systemic infection. On the other hand, 3 of 9 patients in group B had bacterial or fungal infections of the respiratory or urinary tact. One patient had a history of chronic urinary tract infection. In the remaining 5 patients in group B, there were 3 patients with concurrent malignancies and 1 postoperative patient with malignancy. Another in group B had a long history of interstitial pneumonia of unknown origin and severe renal insufficiency. Serum levels of C-reactive protein and creatinine were significantly higher in group B than in group A. In patients with MPO-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, serum PCT levels of \u22650.5 ng/mL are recommended as cutoff for consideration of bacterial and fungal infections. Elevated serum PCT levels could also be observed in some patients with severe injury of the kidneys and/or lungs in the absence of infection."}

The purpose of our study was to evaluate, in the early postcardiac surgery period, whether serial measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) and its change over time (CRP velocity) can assist in detecting bacterial infection. A series of consecutive children who underwent cardiac surgery with bypass were tested for serum levels of CRP at several points up to 5 days postoperatively and during febrile episodes (>38.0\u00b0C). Findings were compared among febrile patients with proven bacterial infection (FWI group; sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep wound infection), febrile patients without bacterial infection (FNI group), and patients without fever (NF group). In all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the FWI group, 42 in the FNI group, and 48 patients in the NF group. Ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years (median 19.0, mean 46 \u00b1 56 months). There was no significant difference among the groups in mean CRP level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. A highly significant interaction was found in the change in CRP over time by FWI group compared with FNI group (P < .001). Mean CRP velocity ([fCRP - 18hCRP]/[fever time (days) - 0.75 day]) was significantly higher in the infectious group (4.0 \u00b1 4.2 mg/dL per d) than in the fever-only group (0.60 \u00b1 1.6 mg/dL per d; P < .001). A CRP velocity of 4 mg/dL per d had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.7% for bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity.

The prevalence of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and adults with spina bifida is considerable, rising, and entirely preventable. PREVENTION OF SPINA BIFIDA: The best prevention of CKD in spina bifida is prevention of spina bifida itself through strategies that include folate supplementation, ideally before pregnancy. Dysfunctional bladder outlet causes febrile Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), even with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and subsequent renal scarring. The development of secondary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) increases the risk of renal scarring and CKD. Creatinine-based methods are insensitive because of low muscle mass and underdeveloped musculature in the legs. Only Cystatin C-based eGFR can reliably assess global renal function in these patients. However, unilateral renal damage requires nuclear medicine scans, such as (99m)Tc DMSA. (VIDEO)URODYNAMICS STUDIES (UDS): Early treatment is recommended based on UDS with anticholinergics, CIC, and antibiotic prophylaxis when indicated. Overnight catheter drainage, Botox, and eventually augmentation cystoplasty are required for poorly compliant bladders. A continent child or one rendered continent following surgery is at a higher risk of renal damage. A multidisciplinary approach is required to reduce the burden of CKD in patients with spina bifida. The right tools have to be utilized to monitor these patients, particularly if recurrent UTIs occur. Cystatin C eGFR is preferred for monitoring renal damage in these patients, and (99m)Tc DMSA scans have to be used to detect unilateral renal scarring."}

The aim of this study was to assess structural changes of the upper pole in renal duplication with coexisting ureterocele with regard to primary and/or secondary lesions. These changes might be of importance in treatment planning. The material of this study consisted of clinical documentation and results of histopathology of 23 upper poles removed due to renal duplication with coexisting ureterocele. The qualification criterion was preserved function of the upper pole seen with 99mTc-DTPA (99mTechnetium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid)/99mTc-DMSA (99mTechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid). Resection of the upper pole was indicated in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections and/or persistent vesicoureteral reflux to the lower pole following endoscopic surgery of the ureterocele and/or low function of the upper pole. Morphological lesions were classified as primary (dysplasia) or secondary lesions. The patients were operated at the Department of Pediatric and Oncologic Surgery, PMU, in 1990-2008. The study group consisted of 17 girls and 6 boys aged from 4 months to 9 years (mean 40 months). Recurrent urinary tract infections noted in 16 (70%) children were the most frequent indication for surgery. The preoperative mean function of the renal poles assessed with DTPA/DMSA represented 6% of the differential renal function. Dysplasia was identified in eight resected renal poles (34%) with coexisting secondary lesions in three of them. Secondary lesions only were seen in 15 poles (66%). There was no correlation between age and incidence of dysplasia during follow-up (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.031). Secondary lesions are a quite frequent finding in resected upper poles. As 66% of the renal poles studied with histopathology revealed secondary lesions only, we believe that renal sparing treatment is justified in cases of urinary duplication with coexisting ureterocele."}

Between 2003 and 2009, a study of neonates with prenatal history of hydronephrosis was performed in order to rule out reflux. Our protocol was as follows: The diagnosis was confirmed by postnatal ultrasound at 1 week (in this case patient initiate antibiotic prophylaxis). A new ultrasound was repeated at 6 weeks, if the dilatation was larger than 8 mm at this time, direct radionuclide scintigraphy was performed. The patients were placed on prophylactic antibiotics until the screenining results were known. Conventional cystography was performed if a male infant showed severe dilatation, or in general in cases with parenchymatous atrophy or if a duplex system was suspected. In 13 (20%) of the 65 cases (18 kidneys) reflux was detected (3 minor, 8 moderate and 7 severe). In most cases, follow up was performed with radionuclide cystography. None of the patients with reflux placed on prophylactic antibiotics developed a febrile urinary tract infection during the first year of life. Direct radionuclide cystography is a useful diagnostic method in early detection of vesicoureteral reflux in patients with prenatal hydronephrosis with higher sensitivity than conventional cystography, and with an important advantage concerning radiation of the patient. Patients screened and placed on prophylactic antibiotics are probably going to present less episodes of pielonephrytis."}

In all, 16 (34%) patients among the 47 with VUR \u22653 were misdiagnosed by the rule.

The rule built to predict VUR \u22653 had a stable specificity (ie. 46%), but a decreased sensitivity (ie. 64%) because of the time variability of PCT measurement. Some refinement may be warranted."}

The incidence of community-acquired infection due to such bacteria is increasing, but few cases of infant upper urinary tract infection (UUTI) have been reported in Japan. We treated four infants with UUTI caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, as determined by genotyping. Using medical records, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical course, antibiotic use and efficacy, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and the presence of underlying disease. One of the four had been previously hospitalized for occult bacteremia. Two developed UUTI after antibiotic treatment, indicating that previous antibiotic use may have been a risk factor in these cases. We could not identify the infection route in all cases. Two of the four had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Renal scintigraphy was done in three. Although an initial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defect was detected in all four, only one had renal scarring. E. coli isolates from all four showed PCR signals for blaCTX-M-; one isolate positive for the blaCTX-M3 group and three positive for blaCTX-M14. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results showed all isolates to be resistant to cephalosporins, but discrepancies existed between antimicrobial susceptibility results and actual clinical efficacy. Clinically, cefazolin (CEZ) was effective in two subjects and ceftazidime (CAZ) effective in one. Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) was effective in one. None of the four developed sepsis or meningitis.

Voiding cystography disclosed grade III vesicoureteral reflux and technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy revealed right to left crossed renal ectopia with fusion (L-shaped kidney). The patient is undergoing standard follow-up for the early detection of possible renal complications. In conclusion, L-shaped kidney is a rare entity and the (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy played an important role on timely diagnosis."}

Sixty-six children, aged 2 months to 6 years old, admitted with clinical and biological signs of their first febrile urinary tract infection were studied. All of the children underwent PDU and technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy within 7 days after diagnosis and repeat scintigraphy at least 6 months later, if results of the first study were abnormal. Scintigraphic and Doppler studies were interpreted and compared. Dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy demonstrated scar in 7.6% of renal units, 3.1% of patients without reflux and 66.7% of those with high-grade reflux. Kidneys with permanent kidney damage had a mean resistive index (RI) of 0.71 \u00b1 0.06, while the RI value for nonscarred kidneys was 0.66 \u00b1 0.06 (P = .02). The best cutoff point of RI value was 0.715, with a sensitivity of 70%, a specificity of 87.7%, and positive and negative predictive values of 32% and 97%, respectively. These values significantly increased when grey-scale ultrasonography findings were brought into account. Reflux was observed in 19.7% of renal units, which were associated with significantly higher RI values (P = .05).

We determined whether nephromegaly on ultrasound can be used to identify patients with urinary tract infection at increased risk for renal scarring, and we investigated the effect of vesicoureteral reflux on renal scarring. We enrolled hospitalized patients with a first febrile urinary tract infection. All patients underwent renal ultrasound and most patients underwent voiding cystourethrography. Renal scarring was assessed using (99m)technetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scintigraphy at least 6 months after treatment. Children with recurrent urinary tract infections before scintigraphy were excluded from the study. A total of 545 children (80 with and 465 without nephromegaly) were enrolled. Infection was more severe in patients with than without nephromegaly. The incidence of renal scarring was significantly higher in patients with nephromegaly (90% vs 32%, p <0.001), in kidneys with nephromegaly (80.5% vs 18.7%, p <0.001) and in kidneys with vesicoureteral reflux (41.5% vs 22.2%, p <0.001). Kidneys with nephromegaly had a greater incidence of reflux. The finding of nephromegaly is associated with a greatly increased likelihood of renal scarring in patients with vesicoureteral reflux. Our results indicate that ultrasound diagnosis of nephromegaly at onset is associated with a high incidence of renal scarring, and identification of nephromegaly at onset and vesicoureteral reflux are significant risk factors for renal scarring in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection.

The follow-up time was calculated from the day of the first visit to the day of the latest dimercaptosuccinic acid scan. Urotherapy, pharmacotherapy, clean intermittent catheterization, biofeedback therapy, and surgery were performed sequentially and/or combined, depending on the disease course. Renal deterioration was defined as any presence of a new scar or cortical thinning compared with the findings from the first dimercaptosuccinic acid scan. Upper urinary tract deterioration was defined as the persistence or progression of hydronephrosis on ultrasonography. The mean age at referral was 9.18 \u00b1 3.36 years (range 2-14), and the mean follow-up period was 80.90 \u00b1 19.57 months (range 54-144).

Children 2 years old or younger with a first febrile urinary tract infection were prospectively studied. Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan within 5 days of admission and after 6 months. Serum samples from all patients were tested for procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and white blood cell count measurements. The 112 enrolled patients (age range 24 days to 24 months old) were divided into acute pyelonephritis (76) and lower urinary tract infection (36) groups according to the results of (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans. Median values of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and white blood cell count at hospitalization were significantly higher in patients with acute pyelonephritis than in those with lower urinary tract infection. The area under receiver operating characteristic curves showed that procalcitonin was superior to C-reactive protein and white blood cell count as a marker for diagnosing acute pyelonephritis. Initial and post-antibiotic treatment procalcitonin values were significantly higher in children with renal scarring than in those without scarring (p <0.001). Procalcitonin values at hospitalization and after treatment were independent predictors of later renal scarring on logistic regression analysis. Our results indicate the superior diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin for predicting acute pyelonephritis in children 2 years old or younger.

We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI's Data were pooled using the random effects model. Twenty RCTs (2324 children) were included. Long-term low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis compared to no treatment/placebo did not significantly reduce repeat symptomatic UTI (846 children: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17) or febrile UTI (946 children: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.24) at two years.

At one to three years, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of new or progressive renal damage on DMSA scan (446 children: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80). Side effects were infrequent when reported, but antibiotics increased the likelihood of bacterial drug resistance threefold (132 UTIs: RR 2.94, 95% CI 1.39 to 6.25).When long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with surgical or endoscopic correction of VUR plus antibiotics for one to 24 months (10 studies, 1141 children), the risk of symptomatic UTI was not significantly different at any time point. Combined surgical and antibiotic treatment caused a 57% reduction in febrile UTI by five years (2 studies, 449 children: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.70) but did not decrease the risk of new or progressive renal damage at any time point. Postoperative obstruction was seen in 0% and 7% of children in two surgical studies and 0% in one endoscopic study. Compared with no treatment, use of long-term, low-dose antibiotics did not significantly reduce the number of repeat symptomatic and febrile UTIs in children with VUR. Considerable heterogeneity in the analyses and inclusion of only one adequately blinded study, made drawing firm conclusions challenging. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of developing new or progressive renal damage, but assuming an 8% baseline risk, 33 children would need long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent one more child developing kidney damage over the course of two to three years.The added benefit of surgical or endoscopic correction of VUR over antibiotic treatment alone remains unclear. Eight children would require combined surgical and antibiotic treatment to prevent one additional child developing febrile UTI by five years, but it would not cause fewer children developing renal damage."}

A total of 96 consecutive patients were included (age range: 0.1-14.9 years, median age: 0.7 years), treated for a first episode of confirmed culture-positive pyelonephritis. At initial hospitalization all patients underwent ultrasound examination of the kidneys and urinary tract (US) and technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine scinti- and renography ( (99m)Tc MAG3). If vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was suspected, then prophylactic antimicrobial therapy was prescribed and the patients were referred to a surgeon for further evaluation including voiding cystoureterography (VCU). Patients with known urological anomalies including antenatally diagnosed anomalies were excluded. All patients were followed up for a median of 5.2 years (3.5-8.6 years). Initially, US findings were abnormal in 29 (30%) patients and (99m)Tc MAG3 findings were abnormal in 20 (21%) cases. At follow-up, prophylactic antimicrobial therapy was prescribed for 19 (20%), and VUR was diagnosed by VCU in 9 patients. Surgery was carried out in 7 (7%) patients, primarily for VUR. If the NICE guidelines had been initially followed, 5 of our 9 patients with VUR would not have been identified. VUR surgery was performed in 4 of these cases. Moreover, 9 cases with urological anomalies subsequently prescribed prophylactic antimicrobial therapy would have been missed. We do not recommend following the imaging strategies of the NICE guidelines for children with a first episode of pyelonephritis. Our most important argument is that at follow-up, after a minimum of 3.5 years, the initial diagnosis of VUR would have been missed in 4 out of the 5 patients who underwent VUR surgery."}

Among the study population, the prevalence of VUR was 17.4% (24 males, 10 females). There was a poor correlation between the severity of hydronephrosis, ureteral dilatation, presence of bilateral hydronephrosis and presence of VUR. Except for the frequency of urinary tract infections and the presence of renal damage on (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans, VCUG was the only reliable method for confirming VUR in this study. The diagnosis of VUR is important for the early detection of renal damage. Further information is needed to develop the optimal approach to the evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis, with reliable parameters that avoid invasive procedures such as VCUG."}

Controversy exists regarding the type and/or sequence of imaging studies needed during the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children. Several investigators have claimed that because acute-phase Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal-scan results are abnormal in the presence of dilating vesicoureteral reflux, a normal DMSA-scan result makes voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) unnecessary in the primary examination of infants with UTI. To evaluate the accuracy of acute-phase DMSA scanning in identifying dilating (grades III through V) vesicoureteral reflux documented by VCUG in children with a first febrile UTI, we performed a meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests as reported from relevant studies identified through the PubMed and Scopus databases. Patient-based and renal unit-based analyses were performed. Overall, 13 cohort studies were identified. Nine studies involved patients younger than 2 years, 3 involved children aged 16 years or younger, and 1 involved exclusively neonates. Girls constituted 22% to 85% of the involved children. Pooled (95% confidence intervals) sensitivity and specificity rates of DMSA scanning were 79% and 53%, respectively, for the patient-based analysis (8 studies) and 60% and 65% for the renal unit-based analysis (5 studies). The respective areas under the hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were 0.71 and 0.67. Marked statistical heterogeneity was observed in both analyses, as indicated by I(2) test values of 91% and 87%, respectively.

Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is found in 1% of all children and in 30%-50% of those with urinary tract infection. Furthermore, VUR in childhood is the main reason for pyelonephritis, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Recently, a variety of procedures with low radiation have been recommended for diagnosis of VUR. Therefore, in this study, voiding urosonography (VUS) or cystosonography was performed for evaluation of VUR and for comparing it with radio nucleotide cystography (RNC). We studied 25 children admitted with initial diagnosis of VUR in our center in the year 2007. Simultaneously, RNC and VUS were performed for all the patients. VUR was detected in eight patients with the VUS procedure and in nine children with RNC. Another patient was diagnosed only by RNC, and two other patients by only VUS. The two methods were concordant in detection and exclusion of urinary reflux in 87% (P: 0.000, r: 0.728). Furthermore, the diagnosis of various grades of reflux by these two schemes were comparable (P: 0.0000, r: 0.724). Sensitivity and specifity of VUS was determined as 87% and 88%, respectively, with a 94% positive predictive value and a 77% negative predictive value.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection disease in all age. From the pediatric urology point of view, difficulty in bladder emptying is the most favorable factor for UTI. Early ultrasonographic (USG) investigation is necessary to detect urinary obstruction and urolithiasis. It is important to perform USG with filled bladder and directly after micturition. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be done after UTI in small children (below 3 years of age). For the detection of renal damage the DMSA-scan is the most sensitive method that should be performed during UTI and 6 months later. In case of bladder dysfunction suspicion the uroflowmetry is substantial. Detection of leucocyturia give rise to microbiological diagnosis and proper treatment. UTI with fever needs antibiotic therapy started in first 24 hours to prevent renal damage. Risk factor for recurrences are bladder dysfunction and residual urine. Prophylaxis should not be restricted to the use of antibiotics or other prophylactic agents but must include the efficient management of bladder and bowel dysfunction and proper liquids administration."}

Infants with hydronephrosis detected prenatally or within the postnatal 28th day and who had no previous history of UTI were followed prospectively without antibacterial prophylaxis. Imaging studies were performed according to our Pediatric Uro-Nephrology Study Group protocol. Dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed in all infants at the end of 1 year of follow-up. Eighty-four infants (56 boys, 28 girls) were included in the study. The distribution of patients in each hydronephrosis grading group was incidentally similar. Within a median follow-up period of 18 (12-24) months, none of the patients had UTI. Furthermore, no pyelonephritic scar was found on DMSA scans in any patient. We conclude that prophylactic antibiotic usage is not indicated in infants with UPJO, regardless of the severity of hydronephrosis, as the risk of UTI is minimal in this population."}

The finding of candiduria in a patient with or without symptoms should be neither dismissed nor hastily treated, but requires a careful evaluation, which should proceed in a logical fashion. Symptoms of Candida pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, or epididymo-orchitis are little different from those of the same infections produced by other pathogens. Candiduria occurring in critically ill patients should initially be regarded as a marker for the possibility of invasive candidiasis. The first step in evaluation is to verify funguria by repeating the urinalysis and urine culture. Pyuria is a nonspecific finding; the morphology of the offending yeast may allow separation of Candida glabrata from other species. Candida casts in the urine are indicative of renal candidiasis but are rarely seen. With respect to culture, colony counts have not proved to be diagnostically useful. In symptomatic or critically ill patients with candiduria, ultrasonography of the kidneys and collecting systems is the preferred initial study. However, computed tomography (CT) is better able to discern pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess.

The AUC were similar for PCT (0.82; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86), CRP (0.88; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91), WBC (0.81; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.85) and ANC (0.80; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.84). The only statistically significant difference was between CRP and ANC (\u0394 AUC 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.16). It is important to note that all the surrogate markers were statistically superior to the clinical evaluation that had an AUC of only 0.59 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.65). The study data demonstrate that CRP, PCT, WBC and ANC had almost similar diagnostic properties and were superior to clinical evaluation in predicting SBI in children aged 1 month to 3 years."}

To evaluate frequency of CVD in dialysis population, in relationship to patients with and without diabetes, and their most common treatment. This retrospective study included 187 patients, 106 males and 81 females, divided in two groups, diabetics and non-diabetics, treated by chronic hemodialysis. Patients' analyses included: anamnesis, ECG, chest X-rays, echocardiogram, laboratory examinations for calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), parathormone (PTH), cholesterol (chol), triglicerids (TG), C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin (Hb) and uric acid. In addition, we analyzed groups of drugs used by patients as prescribed by cardiologists. Average age was 58.0 years, most of them between 51 and 60. Average hemodialysis length was 4 years. Primary kidney diseases were pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis. 19,78% of patients had diabetes. 165 patients (88,23%) had one or more cardiovascular diseases. 110 patients (58,2%) had hypertension, most of them used ACE inhibitors. Using test of multiple correlation, statistically significant correlations, among others, were shown between BMI and Ca, uric acid and P, albumin and PTH in diabetics, at the statistical significance level at p < 0.05. Cardiovascular diseases are the most common comorbidity and cause of mortality in hemodialysis population. There was no statistical significance in age, however there is a statistical difference in the dialysis duration variable, but in some biochemical laboratory parameters there was some difference. ACE inhibitors were most commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and systolic dysfunction, alone or with beta-blockers."}

Few studies have evaluated the incidence of familial vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) among multiple gestation births. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and characteristics of VUR in twins in a large cohort of families with VUR. Between 1998 and 2010, data were collected on 251 families (538 children) with at least 2 siblings who had VUR. The incidence of affected twins among the families was analysed. Data were assessed for age at presentation, gender, grading of VUR, laterality of affectation and renal scarring. VUR was diagnosed by voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans were used to assess renal scarring. There were 12 families (4.8%) in which twins were affected with VUR. There were 12 index cases (7 males/5 females), and 12 siblings (1 male/11 females). All index cases presented with urinary tract infection (UTIs), whereas 2 siblings had UTIs and 10 were screened. All cases presented between 3 months and 2 years. Among the index cases, three had unilateral and nine had bilateral VUR. Among the siblings, four had unilateral and eight had bilateral VUR. Thirty-seven (90%) of the 41 affected renal refluxing units had high-grade VUR. Three index cases had renal scarring. No scarring was seen in the siblings. The vast majority of twins with VUR are females who have high grade VUR and a low incidence of renal scarring. Twins with VUR may represent a genetically different subgroup with female preponderance and severe reflux."}

Ultrasonography and dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy were performed as acute investigations and voiding cystourethrography within 2 months. Late scintigraphy was performed after 1 year in infants with abnormality on the first dimercapto-succinic acid scan or recurrent febrile urinary tract infections. End point was renal damage on the late scan. A total of 270 patients had end point data available, of whom 70 had renal damage and 200 did not. Final kidney status was associated with C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, temperature, leukocyturia, non-Escherichia coli bacteria, anteroposterior diameter on ultrasound and recurrent febrile urinary tract infections. In stepwise multiple regression analysis C-reactive protein, creatinine, leukocyturia, anteroposterior diameter and non-E.coli bacteria were independent predictors of permanent renal damage. C-reactive protein 70 mg/l or greater combined with anteroposterior diameter 10 mm or greater had sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 59% for renal damage. An algorithm for imaging of infants with first time urinary tract infection based on these results would have eliminated 126 acute dimercapto-succinic acid scans compared to our study protocol, while missing 9 patients with permanent renal damage. C-reactive protein can be used as a predictor of permanent renal damage in infants with urinary tract infection and together with anteroposterior diameter serves as a basis for an imaging algorithm."}

Infection following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and increased length of hospital stay. Many studies have investigated the predictive value of known risk factors for infection in patients following CABG and conclusions have been variable and may reveal regional or institution-specific influence. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the pre- and peri-operative risk factors for infection in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery in a developing country. A prospective study was undertaken to collect data on 12 reported risk factors for all patients undergoing CABG during a five-year period at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan. The relationship of these risk factors to infection following CABG was evaluated. Out of 767 consecutive patients admitted for CABG, a total of 73 (9.51%) developed 92 infections following surgery. Sternal Surgical Site Infection (SSI) developed in 30 patients (3.91%), of which 29 (96.7%) were superficial and 1 (3.33%) was deep. There were 37 leg wound infections at the site of conduit harvest, and 2 cases of infection at the intra-aortic balloon pump. There were 12 cases of sepsis and 11 urinary tract infections. There were 26 cases (35.6%) of leukocytosis and 17 patients (23.3%) showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen (39.7%). Bacteremia data was not collected. Of the total cases of infection following CABG, 59 required prolonged hospitalization or readmission. Univariate analysis was performed using a p-value of <0.2 as the inclusion criteria for further analysis using logistic regression. Multivariate analysis with adjusted Relative Risk (RR) showed that diabetes (P=0.002, RR=2.3, 95% CI=1.4-4.0), obesity (P=0.036, RR=2.2, 95% CI=1.0-4.4), use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (P=0.001, RR=3.6, 95% CI=1.7-7.7), female gender (P=0.004, RR=2.5, 95% CI=0.2-0.8) and prolonged mechanical ventilation (P=<0.0001, RR=6.7, 95% CI=2.8-15.5) were independent predictors of infection in the study population. This study suggests that diabetes, obesity, use of an intra-aortic balloon pump and female gender are independent predictors of infection in patients undergoing CABG. Early and strict diabetic control and pre-operative weight reduction may reduce the incidence of infection following CABG. Contamination of these patients may occur before, during and after the operation and efforts to curb such contamination must be intensive. Further prospective studies need to be undertaken to identify and establish these and other risk factors for infection in the region and elsewhere."}

Urinary reflux can cause irreversible complications such as reflux nephropathy and ESRD. Diagnostic imaging such as voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is invasive and causes irradiation. Several studies have shown that markers such as urine IL-8 or serum Procalcitonin might be useful for the diagnosis of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) as a substitution for invasive methods. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the mean urine Ca/Cr ratio and hypercalciuria between two groups of children aged 2-10 years affected by VUR. This is a cross-sectional study in which 32 children having the following entrance criteria were included: children 2-10 years old not affected by urinary tract infection during the last three months and their reflux or recovery having been diagnosed by VCUG or direct radionuclide cystography, divided into two groups of affected by reflux and recovered from reflux. Then, the point urine specimens were collected with permission of their parents in a single laboratory and urine Ca and Cr for each specimen were measured. The Ca/Cr ratio was calculated for each child to evaluate Ca excretion from the urine, which was possible without collecting the 24-hours urine. The Ca/Cr ratio mean and the hypercalciuria were compared between the groups. To analyze our data, the Mann-Whiney test and the Chi-square test were used, using SPSS V.15. Thirty-two children, including 18 children recovered from reflux and 14 affected by reflux, were entered in our study. The Ca/Cr ratio mean was 0.692 \u00b1 1.874 for the affected and 0.118 \u00b1 0.187 for the recovered group. The Ca/Cr ratio mean for the affected male and female groups was 0.012 \u00b1 0.008 and 0.805 \u00b1 1.0913, respectively. This amount was 0.0175 \u00b1 0.01767 for the recovered male and 0.131 \u00b1 0.195 for the recovered female group. There was no significant statistical difference between the groups with respect to the Ca/Cr ratio mean, but there was a significant statistical difference between the two groups of females (P-value = 0.026). Also, there was no significant statistical difference between the two groups of males relative frequency of hypercalciuria was significantly higher in the group affected by reflux than in the recovered from reflux group (P-value = 0.017). Urine Ca excretion is elevated in children with reflux, and may be more useful as an appropriate marker for the diagnosis of VUR than other invasive methods."}

Hepatic nodules in five patients were detected on ultrasound scans, and pulmonary nodules and both hepatic and pulmonary nodules were detected in 12 and two children by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. The mean age of the patients was 24.5 months. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected in nine of 17 patients (52.9%), acute pyelonephritis was identified in nine of 18 patients, and renal scarring was found in 57.1% patients with pyelonephritis. On follow-up, the hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules regressed in all patients. About 85.7% of patients experienced a recurrence of UTI within 1 year. In comparison with age- and sex-matched controls with UTIs without pulmonary or hepatic nodules, the presence of VUR and the recurrence of UTI within 1 year were higher in patients with UTIs and nodules (P<0.05). The hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules identified on the ultrasound scan and by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy may provide a valuable diagnostic marker for the proper management of patients with an UTI."}

The contralateral kidneys were inoculated with saline and served as controls. Pigs were killed 6h post-inoculation (hpi). Differential leucocyte counts, serum biochemical analyses and measurement of serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins were carried out at 0, 3 and 6 hpi. Bacteriological evaluation of urine, kidneys, spleen, liver, abdominal swabs and blood samples and gross and histopathological evaluation of kidneys, renal lymph nodes, liver and spleen were performed by quantitative, semiquantitative and/or descriptive methods. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify cells expressing L1 antigen, CD3\u025b, CD4, CD8, CD79\u03b1cy and lysozyme, and to identify E. coli and Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP). E. coli was re-isolated from all inoculated kidneys. Gross and microscopical lesions of acute pyelonephritis were demonstrated in all but one kidney inoculated with E. coli, but in none of the control kidneys. Renal parenchymal infiltration with both neutrophils and mononuclear cells, primarily CD3+ T lymphocytes, was observed at 6 hpi. Most T lymphocytes were CD8+. Pigs in group C had the highest mean pathology scores. Neutrophils were the dominant renal leucocyte in this group, while the number of mononuclear cells was at least equal to the number of neutrophils in the lesions of pigs from groups A and B. Kidneys with a high number of E. coli had severe lesions. Systemic spread of E. coli was observed in five pigs. THP was observed interstitially in 89% of the E. coli-inoculated kidneys.

The final study group consisted of 274 patients (221 women, 53 men) with a mean age of 43 \u00b1 20 years. The abdominal CT studies were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists by consensus to assess PPT, renal wedge-shaped hypoperfusion areas, and renal abscesses. The laboratory reports obtained on the day of the CT examinations were reviewed for C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBCC), and leukocytes in urine. Presence of PPT was correlated with the presence of renal abscess, extension of renal hypoperfusion areas as well with levels of CRP, leukocytosis, and urine leukocytes using the Fisher's exact Test and the Wilcoxon Test. All patients showed renal hypoperfusion areas consistent with the clinical diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Twenty-nine patients (11%) showed PPT which was significantly associated with the extension of the wedge-shaped renal hypoperfusion areas (P < 0.001), the presence of a renal abscess (P < 0.01), as well as the level of CRP (P < 0.001) and urine leukocytes (P < 0.01). A renal abscess was observed in 36% of patients with PPT compared with 14% of patients without PPT.

Assessment of the first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children has been the subject of debate for many years. Diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) is usually based on clinical and biological data. The clinical usefulness of early Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy remains controversial, although it may influence the type and duration of treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the role of initial cortical scintigraphy in the detection of early renal parenchymal damage in children highly suspected of having APN and to compare the scintigraphic findings with selected clinical/laboratory parameters and ultrasonography. A prospective study was conducted in 34 infants and young children (18 boys, 16 girls), aged 1.5-36 months (mean 9.8 \u00b1 8.7 months), hospitalized with a first episode of clinically suspected APN. Within the first 5 days after admission, Tc-99m DMSA renal scintigraphy, ultrasonography (US), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC) and urine analyses were performed. DMSA scintigraphy showed changes consistent with APN in 27/34 (79%) patients, with a mean age of 10.9 months, including 12 males (44%) and 15 (56%) females. Out of 9 febrile children with negative urine culture and supportive evidence of UTI, scintigraphy showed parenchymal involvement in 8 children (24% in the whole group, 30% in scintigraphically documented APN). There were no statistically significant correlations between the frequency or size of the initial scintigraphic abnormalities and age, sex, body temperature, CRP levels or ESR. A CRP level of >54 mg/L and a WBC of >13,300/mm\u00b3 had sensitivities of 56 and 59% and specificities of 86 and 71%, respectively. US showed changes consistent with APN in 7/34 (21%) in the whole group and in 7/27 (26%) patients with positive cortical scan (p < 0.05). Initial DMSA renal scintigraphy is a sensitive method for the early diagnosis of APN in young children and is useful in the assessment of the severity of kidney injury even in patients with negative urine culture. Clinical, biological and ultrasound parameters do not identify children with renal damage. Normal DMSA study, excluding parenchymal involvement and late sequelae, could minimize the use of scintigraphy in the follow-up and reduce the redundancy of cystography."}

A total of 533 children following a first urinary tract infection were included in the analysis. Patients were assessed by 3 diagnostic imaging studies, renal ultrasound, dimercapto-succinic acid scan and voiding cystourethrography. The main event of interest was the presence of high grade (III to V) vesicoureteral reflux. The combined and separate diagnostic accuracy of screening methods was assessed by calculation of diagnostic OR, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. A total of 246 patients had reflux, of whom 144 (27%) had high grade (III to V) disease. Sensitivity, negative predictive value and diagnostic OR of ultrasound for high grade reflux were 83.3%, 90.8% and 7.9, respectively. Dimercapto-succinic acid scan had the same sensitivity as ultrasound but a higher negative predictive value (91.7%) and diagnostic OR (10.9). If both tests were analyzed in parallel by using the OR rule, ie a negative diagnosis was established only when both test results were normal, sensitivity increased to 97%, negative predictive value to 97% and diagnostic OR to 25.3. Only 9 children (6.3%) with dilating reflux had an absence of alterations in both tests. Our findings support the idea that ultrasound and dimercapto-succinic acid scan used in combination are reliable predictors of dilating vesicoureteral reflux."}

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of i.v. antibiotics selected for the treatment of febrile AP and to examine the risk factors for antibiotic resistance. We set risk factors for antibiotic treatment failure such as age, sex, and the presence of underlying urinary tract disease. We classified all cases into 49 cases of complicated AP and 24 cases of uncomplicated AP according to the presence of underlying urinary tract diseases, and examined the characteristics of the patients and the efficacy of the antibiotics used in this study. We investigated risk factors which relate to initial treatment failure and the duration of antibiotic treatment. Initial antibiotic treatment failure was significantly correlated to C-reactive protein in complicated AP and to positive blood culture in uncomplicated AP. We revealed a significant correlation between the duration of the given antibiotics and diabetes mellitus or positive blood culture in uncomplicated AP, and tazobactam/piperacillin was significantly related to prolongation of antibiotic treatment in complicated AP. In conclusion, in this study, a positive blood culture was the representative risk factor that related to both initial treatment failure and longer duration of the given antibiotics in uncomplicated AP."}

Many emergency practitioners feel compelled to admit all elderly and diabetic women with APN to the hospital. We explored the association between age and presence of diabetes with hospital admission in women with APN. A retrospective chart review was undertaken on women with a diagnosis of APN made in the Emergency Department between May 2003 and December 2005. Exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy, immune suppression other than diabetes, urinary stone, septic shock, and hydronephrosis. Standardized chart review was performed and the primary outcome was admission to the hospital. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with hospital admission. Of the 388 patients included, 185 (47.7%) were admitted. After adjusting for confounding variables, the odds ratios of admission for those who had been recently hospitalized or had a low serum albumin level or a high C-reactive protein level were 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-4.02), 1.96 (95% CI 1.09-6.05), and 2.57 (95% CI 1.11-3.46), respectively. Older age and the presence of diabetes were not found to be independently associated with admission. In women with acute pyelonephritis, an older age and diabetes were not found to be independently associated with hospital admission."}

This aim of this study was to assess the clinical manifestations, the microorganisms involved and their antibiotic resistance in children hospitalized due to acute lobar nephronia (ALN) and non-ALN community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). We retrospectively reviewed the records of 265 previously healthy children hospitalized due to a first-episode of community-acquired febrile UTI between July 2004 and June 2007. Based on the results of renal ultrasonography and computed tomography, they were divided into ALN and non-ALN groups. Their demographic and clinical characteristics, distribution of microorganisms, and their antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. Of the total number of cases of children admitted with a first-episode community-acquired UTI, 19.2% (n=51) were diagnosed as ALN. Children with ALN were older (1.86 years vs. 0.81 years; p < 0.01), had longer periods of fever before admission (4.7 days vs. 1.4 days; p < 0.01), higher peak body temperatures (39.5\u00b0C vs. 38.9\u00b0C; p < 0.01), higher white cell counts (18.86 \u00d7 10(9)/L vs. 15.08 \u00d7 10(9)/L; p < 0.01) and higher C-reactive protein levels (9.0 mg/dL vs. 3.5 mg/dL; p < 0.01) compared with non-ALN children. Fever also persisted for longer after the start of antibiotic treatment in the ALN children (2.7 days vs. 1.4 days: p < 0.01) and they required longer hospital stays and incurred higher medical costs. The major pathogen found in ALN was E. coli (90%). The E. coli isolated from ALN children was more resistant to cotrimoxazole and ciprofloxacin than those from non-ALN children. ALN is not uncommon in children with a first-episode febrile UTI. They have a prolonged clinical course, higher inflammatory parameters, longer hospital stays and incur higher medical costs. E. coli is the major pathogen isolated from these children."}

The aim of the reported investigation was a comparison of the diagnostic efficacy of parametric clearance images and the conventional summation images - obtained from dynamic scintigraphy - in the detection of local defects of renal function. As the \"gold standard\" for the above comparison, the static scintigraphy of kidneys was accepted. Forty-one patients (age 4-19 years), 28 girls and 13 boys, participated in the study. Altogether, 73 kidneys were analyzed (in 9 patients, only one kidney). In each patient dynamic renal scintigraphy was performed after IV administration of 99mTc EC (ethylenedicysteine) and static planar renal scintigraphy using 99mTc-DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) as a reference method. From the dynamic study, summation and parametric clearance images were generated. Each kidney was divided into 3 segments (upper, middle, lower); altogether 219 segments were evaluated by modified Howard's scale. Planar and oblique projection images were compared with corresponding summation and parametric clearance images. Parametric clearance imaging has a higher sensitivity and accuracy for detection of regional post-inflammatory changes in the kidneys than conventional summation images (p < 0.05) and shows parenchymal changes similarly to static scintigraphy (high Cohen's kappa index)."}
{"id": "21089406", "title": "[Imaging of urinary tract infection in children].", "content": "[Imaging of urinary tract infection in children]. Urinary tract infection is very common in children. Its diagnosis, management and treatment have led to abundant literature and many controversies. The main challenges are to identify patients at risk of infection and those at risk of complicated infections. Long-term complications include reflux nephropathy, renal hypertension and stage renal disease. Imaging has a triple role: to confirm the diagnosis in patients with equivocal clinical symptoms; to determine patients at risk of recurrence; prevention of infection by detecting already in utero patients with congenital malformation. During the acute phase, Ultrasound has an important role in detecting favouring conditions such as urinary tract dilatation. The use of color Doppler increases the sensibility and specificity of ultrasound. To date, DMSA scan is the key examination for demonstrating the parenchymal lesions. CT-scan and MRI are rarely used in this acute phase. Retrograde voiding cystography (RVC) will be used whenever vesico-ureteric reflux is suspected. A decision algorithm can be proposed bases on US and DMSA; RVC will be performed whenever one of them is positive. CT or MRI will be used to look for abscesses complicating the UTI. DMSA scan is the gold standard for detecting renal scanning, sequellae of the infection. In the future, the role of MRI will surely increase for the demonstration of uropathy acute and sequelae of the renal involvement."}

The usefulness and cost-effectiveness of this practice have been criticized. This study aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics and the biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) as an aid in predicting bacteremia. A prospective observational multicenter cohort study included consecutive adults with febrile UTI in 35 primary care units and 8 emergency departments of 7 regional hospitals. Clinical and microbiological data were collected and PCT and time to positivity (TTP) of blood culture were measured. Of 581 evaluable patients, 136 (23%) had bacteremia. The median age was 66 years (interquartile range 46 to 78 years) and 219 (38%) were male. We evaluated three different models: a clinical model including seven bed-side characteristics, the clinical model plus PCT, and a PCT only model. The diagnostic abilities of these models as reflected by area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic were 0.71 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66 to 0.76), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75 to 0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.77) respectively. Calculating corresponding sensitivity and specificity for the presence of bacteremia after each step of adding a significant predictor in the model yielded that the PCT > 0.25 \u03bcg/l only model had the best diagnostic performance (sensitivity 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89 to 0.98, specificity 0.50; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.55). Using PCT as a single decision tool, this would result in 40% fewer blood cultures being taken, while still identifying 94 to 99% of patients with bacteremia.The TTP of E. coli positive blood cultures was linearly correlated with the PCT log value; the higher the PCT the shorter the TTP (R(2) = 0.278, P = 0.007). PCT accurately predicts the presence of bacteremia and bacterial load in patients with febrile UTI. This may be a helpful biomarker to limit use of blood culture resources."}

INTRODUCTION. Urinary tract infection is the most common serious bacterial infection in children. The aim of this study was to compare the value of different laboratory and imaging techniques in detecting renal involvement in acute pyelonephritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In a cross-sectional study of patients 1 month to 14 years of age diagnosed with urinary tract infection were examined with systemic inflammatory markers, renal ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), and technetium Tc 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) renal scintigraphy. A total of 1467 pediatric patients were eligible for treatment of pyelonephritis. Evaluations included a complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urinalysis, urine culture, and measurement of serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. RESULTS. The results of (99m)Tc-DMSA scans were normal in 20.2%, mild decreased cortical uptake in 45.0%, moderate decreased cortical uptake in 12.3%, severe decreased cortical uptake in 12.0%, and decreased cortical function plus irregularity or scar formation in 10.5%. Voiding cystourethrography showed vesicoureteral reflux in 25.9%. The sensitivity of (99m)Tc-DMSA for prediction of vesicoureteral reflux was 84.1% with a negative predictive value of 80.6%. Significant differences were found in the level of blood leukocyte count (P = .03), urine leukocyte count (P = .003), ESR (P = .008), and age (P = .04) between patients with normal and abnormal (99m)Tc-DMSA scan results. CONCLUSIONS. We found that in patient with clinical signs of pyelonephritis, (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy can detect pyelonephritis more accurately than the other inflammatory and imaging tests."}

We evaluated the influence of patient factors and virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli on the occurrence of acute pyelonephritis and subsequent renal parenchymal scarring. We evaluated 80 boys and 45 girls 1 to 180 months old with febrile urinary tract infections who underwent renal scan to diagnose acute pyelonephritis and followup dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy at least 6 months later. Urinalysis, white blood cell count, uropathogenic E. coli genotype and vesicoureteral reflux were measured. Voiding cystourethrogram was investigated after acute pyelonephritis was confirmed by renal scan and acute inflammation subsided, about 2 to 4 weeks later. Acute pyelonephritis was significantly more likely to develop in children with urinary tract infections and persistent fever before and after hospitalization, elevated C-reactive protein or positive renal ultrasound findings. E. coli strains with the papG II and iha genes were significantly more likely to occur in patients with acute pyelonephritis. Patients with a fever for more than 3 days and C-reactive protein levels greater than 90.8 mg/l were significantly more likely to have renal scarring. Age was not an independent predictor of acute pyelonephritis, but modified the effect of virulence factors on the development of acute pyelonephritis. Bacterial virulence factors and host factors are associated with the occurrence of acute pyelonephritis. Host factors such as patient age and vesicoureteral reflux severity modify the influence of virulence factors, although only host factors are associated with the occurrence of renal scarring."}

Evaluation in children after febrile urinary tract infection involves voiding cystourethrogram, which emphasizes urinary reflux rather than renal risk. We believe that early dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan after febrile urinary tract infection predicts clinically significant reflux and which children should undergo voiding cystourethrogram. The criticism of this approach is that some reflux and preventable renal damage would be missed. This study validates the use of initial dimercapto-succinic scan and presents 5-year renal outcomes. We prospectively studied children with febrile urinary tract infection using initial dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan, voiding cystourethrogram and renal/bladder ultrasound. Children with anatomical or neurological genitourinary abnormality and protocol failures were excluded from analysis. Dimercapto-succinic acid scan was repeated at 6 months if initially abnormal. Followup was done every 6 months in all children for at least 5 years. A total of 121 children fit study inclusion criteria and completed the 5-year study. Overall 88 initial dimercapto-succinic acid scans (73%) were abnormal and 78 children (64%) had urinary reflux. The OR of having clinically significant reflux predicted by abnormal initial scan was 35.4. Abnormal followup scan did not predict clinically significant reflux. Overall subsequent urinary tract infection developed in 32 patients (26.5%) and 27 (85%) had an abnormal initial scan. No child with a normal initial scan had clinically significant reflux. Dimercapto-succinic acid scan can predict clinically significant reflux and children at greatest renal risk. Initial dimercapto-succinic acid scan should be done in all children after febrile urinary tract infection while voiding cystourethrogram should be reserved for those with an abnormal initial dimercapto-succinic acid scan."}

Children aged<or=24 months and were admitted with a first febrile UTI during a 5-year period were evaluated. The ability of acute DMSA scintigraphy to reveal dilating (grades 3-5) or severe (grades 4-5) VUR was assessed by comparing DMSA scan findings with those of voiding cystourethrography.

The medical records of children (age < or = 2 years), presenting with febrile UTI between January 2000 and December 2009, were retrospectively reviewed. All cases underwent DMSA renal scan within 1 week after diagnosis and MCU within 1 week after infection. According to the results of MCU, children were divided into groups of non-VUR, low-grade and high-grade VUR. A total of 370 children (233 boys, 137 girls) were included, of whom 263 (71.1%) had abnormal DMSA results and 126 (34.1%) were identified as VUR on MCU. Among children with VUR, the number of high-grade was 103 (81.7%). The rate of abnormal results on DMSA of high-grade VUR group was significantly higher than the rates of the other two groups (P < 0.01). The sensitivity of DMSA for detecting high grade VUR was 99.0%. The negative predictive value was 99.1% and negative likelihood ratio was 0.03, respectively. High-grade VUR remains an important risk factor of renal damage for young children with febrile UTI. The possibility to detect high-grade VUR on MCU is rather low when the result of DMSA is negative. It is recommended that DMSA be used before MCU to investigate the febrile UTI children at acute phase, because it would predict the majority of children with high-grade VUR while detecting renal lesions."}

The American Urological Association established the Vesicoureteral Reflux Guideline Update Committee in July 2005 to update the management of primary vesicoureteral reflux in children guideline. The Panel defined the task into 5 topics pertaining to specific vesicoureteral reflux management issues, which correspond to the management of 3 distinct index patients and the screening of 2 distinct index patients. This report summarizes the existing evidence pertaining to screening of siblings and offspring of index patients with vesicoureteral reflux and infants with prenatal hydronephrosis. From this evidence clinical practice guidelines are developed to manage the clinical scenarios insofar as the data permit. The Panel searched the MEDLINE(R) database from 1994 to 2008 for all relevant articles dealing with the 5 chosen guideline topics. The database was reviewed and each abstract segregated into a specific topic area. Exclusions were case reports, basic science, secondary reflux, review articles and not relevant. The extracted article to be accepted should have assessed a cohort of children, clearly stating the number of children undergoing screening for vesicoureteral reflux. Vesicoureteral reflux should have been diagnosed with a cystogram and renal outcomes assessed by nuclear scintigraphy. The screening articles were extracted into data tables developed to evaluate epidemiological factors, patient and renal outcomes, and results of treatment. The reporting of meta-analysis of observational studies elaborated by the MOOSE group was followed. The extracted data were analyzed and formulated into evidence-based recommendations regarding the screening of siblings and offspring in index cases with vesicoureteral reflux and infants with prenatal hydronephrosis. In screened populations the prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux is 27.4% in siblings and 35.7% in offspring. Prevalence decreases at a rate of 1 screened person every 3 months of age. The prevalence is the same in males and females. Bilateral reflux prevalence is similar to unilateral reflux. Grade I-II reflux is estimated to be present in 16.7% and grade III-V reflux in 9.8% of screened patients. The estimate for renal cortical abnormalities overall is 19.3%, with 27.8% having renal damage in cohorts of symptomatic and asymptomatic children combined. In asymptomatic siblings only the rate of renal damage is 14.4%. There are presently no randomized, controlled trials of treated vs untreated screened siblings with vesicoureteral reflux to evaluate health outcomes as spontaneous resolution, decreased rates of urinary infection, pyelonephritis or renal scarring. In screened populations with prenatal hydronephrosis the prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux is 16.2%. Reflux in the contralateral nondilated kidney accounted for a mean of 25.2% of detected cases for a mean prevalence of 4.1%. In patients with a normal postnatal renal ultrasound the prevalence of reflux is 17%. The prenatal anteroposterior renal pelvic diameter was not predictive of reflux prevalence. A diameter of 4 mm is associated with a 10% to 20% prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux. The prevalence of reflux is statistically significantly greater in females (23%) than males (16%) (p=0.022). Reflux grade distribution is approximately a third each for grades I-II, III and IV-V. The estimate of renal damage in screened infants without infection is 21.8%. When stratified by reflux grade renal damage was estimated to be present in 6.2% grade I-III and 47.9% grade IV-V (p <0.0001). The risk of urinary tract infection in patients with and without prenatal hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux could not be determined. The incidence of reported urinary tract infection in patients with reflux was 4.2%. The meta-analysis provided meaningful information regarding screening for vesicoureteral reflux. However, the lack of randomized clinical trials for screened patients to assess clinical health outcomes has made evidence-based guideline recommendations difficult. Consequently, screening guidelines are based on present practice, risk assessment, meta-analysis results and Panel consensus."}

Patients from both groups also had complete blood count, blood culture, urine analysis, and culture performed. Chest radiography or lumbar puncture could be performed if required. Of the 384 children enrolled and equally randomized into the PCT+ and PCT- groups, 62 (16%) were diagnosed with a serious bacterial infection (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, occult bacteremia, or bacterial meningitis) by primary ED investigation. Ten were also found to be neutropenic (<500 x 10(6)/L). Of the remaining undiagnosed patients, 14 (9%) of 158 received antibiotics in the PCT+ group vs 16 (10%) of 154 in the PCT- group (Delta -2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8 to 5). A strategy to treat all patients with PCT of 0.5 ng/mL or greater with prophylactic antibiotic in this group of patients would have resulted in an increase in antibiotic use by 24% (95% CI, 15-33). Semiquantitative PCT measurement had no impact on antibiotic use in children aged 1 to 36 months who presented with fever without source. However, a strategy to use prophylactic antibiotics in all patients with abnormal PCT results would have resulted in an increase use of antibiotics."}

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in infants and children and may result in serious complications, such as renal scarring, hypertension, and renal failure. Identification of the new markers in relation to acute pyelonephritis (APN) and its treatment is essential for designing interventions that would minimize tissue damage. This prospective study investigated the first UTI infection in 71 children (age range: 1-24 months) in respect to interleukin-6 (IL-6) -174G/C polymorphism and renal scarring. The patients were divided into an APN group and a lower UTI group according to dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). The IL-6 -174G/C genotypes were determined by tetra-primer ARMSPCR. Serum IL-6 was significantly higher in the APN group than in the group with lower UTI (p<0.05). In both groups, the -174G/C genotype and allele frequencies did not differ significantly from the control group. The highest white blood cell (WBC) count was observed in the CC genotype (p<0.05). A non-significant trend toward higher serum IL-6 was observed in children with CC genotype. On follow-up DMSA imaging performed 6 months later, renal scarring was detected in 36.9% of APN children. We did not find the significant association of IL-6 -174G/C polymorphism with APN and/or postinfectious renal scarring. These results indicate that serum IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in children with APN than in patients with lower UTI."}

The blood level of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate reflect inflammation and are useful for the diagnosis of bacterial infection. However, these markers are often increased in other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor of calcitonin, was reported to be produced at the time of bacterial infection. The detection of PCT in blood is especially useful for the diagnosis of bacteremia. PCT is also considered to be useful for the diagnosis of limited bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and pyelonephritis, although the level in these conditions could be much less than that in bacteremia. There are two methods for the measurement of PCT in Japan: the chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and immunochromatography assay (IC). CLEIA is quantitative and is sensitive for detecting a low level of PCT. IC is semi-quantitative and is useful for bed-side testing. It is important to understand the features of these two methods of PCT and to use them in appropriate situations."}

Atypical UTI was defined as in the NICE UTI guideline. Overall, 576 boys and 244 girls aged below 24 months were reviewed. All underwent ultrasound (US) and micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) and 612 underwent DMSA scans. US was abnormal in 73 (8.9%) and vesicoureteral reflux was shown in 195 patients (23.8%). A total of 126 patients were considered to have remediable urological abnormalities requiring additional surgical or medical interventions. The NICE guideline yielded excellent negative predictive values (NPV) of 100-94.4% in girls but 91% in boys. If all boys underwent US and DMSA and only those with atypical UTI or abnormal US or DMSA proceeded to MCUG, then the NPV increased to 95.2% and 97.4% for boys aged below and above 6 months, respectively. These revised strategies would substantially save invasive studies-DMSA and MCUG in 27 and 74% of girls aged below and above 6 months, respectively, or MCUG in 23 and 59% of boys aged below and above 6 months, respectively."}

Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) has evolved into an effective imaging tool for the evaluation of the urinary tract in children. The goal of this article is to describe current techniques and applications of MRU and to review recent advances. MRU is most commonly applied to the evaluation of hydronephrosis and provides valuable insight into a wide range of obstructive uropathies. MRU was shown to be superior to renal scintigraphy for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. The use of MRU for the assessment of urolithiasis, vesicoureteral reflux, renal trauma, and fetal urinary tract abnormalities is limited and technical refinements are required. Judicious use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients at risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis was recently shown to avoid new occurrences. Potential future applications include virtual endoscopy and MRU-guided procedures. MRU has the potential to revolutionize imaging of the urinary tract in children. It integrates exquisite anatomical information with a variety of functional data and avoids ionizing radiation. MRU is increasingly employed as a problem solver when conventional imaging studies remain inconclusive and its growing application will likely improve availability and cost in the future."}

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an uncommon form of chronic pyelonephritis rarely seen in children. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult and management is still obscure. The authors report on a focal pseudotumoral case and discuss therapeutic modalities. A 2-year-old boy was admitted for a 2-weeks history of fever and right flank pain. Physical examination revealed a right lumbar mass. White blood cell count was 12.800/mm3 and C reactive protein elevated (50 mg/l). The urine culture was negative. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography demonstrated a focal multilocular cystic mass of the lower polar of right kidney, measuring 80 millimeters, with peripheral enhancement and perirenal involvement. At surgical exploration, a huge abscess of the lower polar of the kidney with dense adhesions to adjacent structures were noted. Excision of the collection and local drainage were performed. Pathologic examination of biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. Intraoperative culture was positive for Escherichia coli. Successful treatment of the lesion was achieved with adjunctive antibiotic therapy. The postoperative course was uneventful over a follow-up period of 2 years. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a renal mass. A first-line conservative treatment must be strongly recommended in pediatric focal cases."}

Vesicoureteric reflux is usually managed medically. When medical management fails, the patient is referred for surgical intervention. The aim is to protect the kidneys from progressive damage. This study investigates if significant kidney damage has occurred during medical treatment prior to surgical intervention. Case notes of all children treated with ureteric re-implantation for vesicoureteric reflux in a 5-year period were reviewed. Demographic details, radiological investigations, surgery and follow-up were recorded. Indication for surgery was failure of medical treatment. Kidney damage was defined as the presence of a scar on the DMSA scans and/or kidney function below 45% in one kidney. Forty-two patients underwent ureteric re-implantation with 24 having a bilateral procedure resulting in a total of 66 renal units. Mean age at surgery was 7.4 years. Thirty-eight kidneys (58%) showed reduced function prior to medical treatment. Twenty-four kidneys (36%) had deterioration of renal function associated with recurrent urinary tract infections during the course of medical treatment with the overall mean function of the worst affected kidney being 28%. Thirty-five patients (83%) demonstrated scarring on their kidneys on DMSA scan prior to surgery. More than half of patients who eventually need ureteric re-implantation for vesicoureteric reflux have already suffered kidney damage prior to start of medical treatment. A third will have progressive deterioration of their renal functions. Early referral for medical management coupled with early surgical intervention in selected cases should hopefully reduce the number of children with renal damage due to VUR."}

Through a case series study, PCT and C-reactive protein rapid tests were measured in children with proven UTI at the Tehran Children's Medical Center, Iran. One-hundred patients aged 1 month-14 years old (19 boys and 81 girls) with documented UTI were enrolled in the study. Of 100 children, 62 patients (62%) had renal involvement on the basis of abnormal Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy and 38 patients (38%) had infection restricted to the lower urinary tract. There were no differences related to age or gender among the groups. The sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 77% and 89%, respectively, in prediction of renal involvement, whereas C-reactive protein had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 65%.

We have developed a simplified technique, Bnai Zion Planar Method (BZPM), to estimate absolute DMSA uptake by the kidneys, which uses a shorter time of acquisition and does not require cumbersome calculations of attenuation correction. The aim of this study was to validate this technique by comparing it with the Quantitative DMSA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (QDMSA) measurements as the reference method. Sixty-one consecutive children (mean age 5.4+/-4.8 years) were included in the study. Absolute uptake of the radiopharmaceutical by the kidneys was measured using the QDMSA SPECT methods described earlier with data acquisition of 20 min. Kidney volumes and radioactivity concentration measurements were calculated on the reconstruction data using the threshold method. For the simplified technique (BZPM), a planar posterior view of the kidneys was acquired for 1 min at the end of the QDMSA SPECT study. In both kidneys we observed a significant strong correlation between the two methods. BZPM measurements were very similar to those obtained using the validated QDMSA method, as determined by linear regression analysis (Pearson's r=0.924, P<0.001), r(2)=0.854. The uptake according to QDMSA can be predicted by the uptake measured by the BZPM method using the following regression equation: QDMSA=0.445+1.061 BZPM.

Multiple regression analysis on independent variables showed that only ALN was significantly associated with a higher incidence of renal scarring. Our results showed a new finding that ALN is associated with a very high incidence of renal scarring, in comparison to APN, irrespective of the duration of antibiotic treatment."}

A 38-year-old man presented with pain in the right upper abdomen combined with elevated C-reactive protein (5.37 mg/dl) and creatinine levels (2.0 mg/dl). The medical history revealed recurrent abdominal pain. Duplex sonography showed large intrahepatic cystic structures, partially combined with a ribbon-shaped flow signal inside, as well as multiple cysts in the kidneys. The following MRI identified these findings as dilatated bile ducts surrounding the portal vein branches. This is known as the central dot sign. Overall, this special constellation is indicative of Caroli's disease, a rare congenital cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The imaging results substantiated the diagnosis, especially in combination with cystic renal disease and recurrent cholangitis. Depending on the grade of liver involvement the treatment is partial hepatectomy or, as in our case transplantation, which also eliminates the risk of associated cholangiocarcinoma."}

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in children, and its role in the pathogenesis of scarred kidney is debated. We report on a 7-year-old child who presented with severe UTI. The early (day 4) renal computed tomography (CT) scan showed normal-sized kidneys (110 mm on the left, 105 mm on the right), whereas the control CT scan and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, performed 1 and 2 months later, respectively, showed a small scarred right kidney (60 mm) with a 12% residual function. An intermittent right vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was diagnosed by direct isotopic cystography and then treated by Cohen vesicoureteral reimplantation. The patient remained free of infectious recurrence, hypertension, or renal function decrease. This report demonstrates that one episode of acute pyelonephritis can lead to severe renal scarring. Whereas antenatal lesions are thought to have a stronger role in the causal pathway for reflux nephropathy than is UTI in addition to VUR, this observation reminds us that UTI can truly play an important role in damaging kidneys."}

Overall spontaneous reflux resolution, including cases downgraded to grade I to II, was 38%. Variables significantly negatively correlated to resolution were breakthrough febrile urinary tract infection, bladder dysfunction, higher grade of reflux at inclusion, renal abnormality, subnormal renal function, increased bladder capacity, residual urine and passive occurrence of reflux. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model with stepwise selection identified 3 independent predictors--renal abnormality (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.31-0.64, p <0.0001), bladder dysfunction (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.29-0.64, p <0.0001) and breakthrough urinary tract infection (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.78, p = 0.009).

Compared to the cases where AL did not develop, there was a significantly higher increase in CRP from the preoperative level to the levels measured on postoperative day 3, 5, 6 and 7. Higher CRP levels were observed in patients experiencing pneumonia or urinary tract infection, but the decrease of CRP values was not as slow as in cases of AL. This study shows serum CRP level to be a relevant marker in detecting postoperative complications in colorectal surgery.

The risk of renal scar formation following urinary tract infection (UTI) varies markedly between individuals. We sought to investigate a possible role of the common polymorphisms in the gene encoding for VEGF and TGFbeta-1, key regulators of tissue repair, in renal scarring. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 104 children (63 males) aged 2 months to 12 years by urine culture and 99Tc-DMSA renal scan. A follow-up isotope scan was performed 4-6 months later to identify new renal scar formation. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was examined by micturating cystourethrogram. Controls comprised 300 healthy children with no evidence of renal disease. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGFbeta-1 (-800 A/G, -509 C/T and 869 C/T) and four SNPs in the VEGF gene (-2578 C/A, -1154 G/A, -460 T/C and +405 G/C) were genotyped in all subjects. Forty-six of the 104 patients developed renal parenchymal scarring (44.2%). VUR was found in 35.6%. The -509 T allele in the TGFbeta-1 promoter was significantly more common in cases with renal scarring (51%) than in non-scarring patients (22.4%) and controls (23.6%) (both P < 0.0001). At the haplotype level, the GTC combination at -800/-509/+869 was strongly associated with renal scarring (P = 0.0002). VEGF-460 CC was more common in UTI cases with renal scarring than in non-scarring patients and controls (P = 0.03 and 0.001, respectively). Multiple logistic regression testing identified the presence of VUR (odds ratio 12.4, CI 3.8-40; P < 0.001) and the TGFbeta-1 -509 T allele (OR 6.1, CI 2.4-15.5; P < 0.001) as independent risk factors for renal scarring after UTI. In contrast, age, gender and the type of underlying organism were not predictive of renal scarring. Activating variants in the TGFbeta-1 and VEGF gene promoters are associated with post-UTI renal scar formation in children. The TGFbeta-1 509T allele predicts renal scarring independent of VUR."}

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) plays an essential pathophysiological role in inflammatory reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical utility of urine MIF (uMIF) level in predicting urinary tract infections (UTI). This multicenter, prospective study was conducted over a 1-year period between March 2008 and March 2009. Sixty patients with symptomatic culture-proven UTI and 29 healthy children were recruited. Urine MIF was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean MIF level was found to be significantly higher in the UTI group than in the control group (1082.82 vs. 211.45 pg/ml, p = 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off uMIF level was 295 pg/ml for uMIF to predict UTI. The sensitivity and specificity of this cut-off level were 91.7% and 69%, respectively. Mean uMIF/creatinine (Cr) was also significantly higher in the UTI group than in the control group (2400.69 vs. 267.56 pg/mgCr, p = 0.0001). At a cut-off of 815 pg/mgCr for uMIF/Cr, the sensitivity and specificity were 95 and 79%, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.848 (standard error 0.040, 95% confidence interval 0.756-0.915) for uMIF and 0.889 (0.034, 0.805-0.946) for uMIF/Cr. Urine MIF/Cr was significantly higher in the patients with a positive leukocyte esterase reaction in the urine (p = 0.047), leukocytosis (p = 0.0001) and positive C-reactive protein level in serum (p = 0.003). The uMIF level was not related to leukocytosis, positive CRP level in serum and leukocyte esterase reaction in the urine. Neither uMIF nor uMIF/Cr were correlated to the positive urine nitrite test, pyuria, urine pH and specific gravity (p > 0.05). These results suggest that urine MIF and uMIF/Cr can be used for the early prediction of UTI in children."}

In all, 206 renoureteral units were included in the study. Overall, seven had anastomotic stricture and of those, three were symptomatic and were corrected; while four were asymptomatic and of those, only two, with preserved split GFR, were surgically treated, while the remaining two, with a poor split GFR, were followed up. The last 99mTc-DTPA showed a preserved split GFR in the reimplanted units and further split renal function decrease in untreated units. Nonobstructive dilatation of the upper urinary tract, caused by reflux, was diagnosed in 13 units. The dilatation was bilateral in three patients with recurrent UTIs and urosepsis, and the split GFR was bilaterally reduced at diagnosis with a further reduction at the last 99mTc-DTPA. The remaining seven units with sterile urine, showed a preserved split GFR during follow up. All strictures, regardless of their severity, should be immediately corrected. Reflux per se does not provoke renal impairment unless recurrent UTIs and urosepsis are present."}

Baseline CRP, PCT and ANP were measured and their accuracy in identifying the necessity of admission was analysed using area under curves (AUC) of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots. According to the reference standard, 126 (22%) patients required admission. ANP (AUC 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.80) and PCT (AUC 0.75, 95% CI 0.71-0.80) more accurately predicted this than did CRP (AUC 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74).

Information on 427 infants who had undergone US, MCUG and DMSA following a first febrile UTI was prospectively recorded. The infants were divided into two groups: A (354) with normal renal US and B (73) with abnormal US. DMSA findings were correlated with findings on MCUG. Main outcome measures were incidence of recurrent UTIs, change in management or intervention as a result of MCUG, and outcome at discharge.

In Group B (abnormal US), 23/73 (32%) had scarring on DMSA and vesicoureteric reflux, predominantly high grade on MCUG. Of the infants with non-scarred kidneys, 73% had dilating reflux. Successful conservative treatment was performed in 423 infants, and 4 infants in Group B required surgery. We recommend US and DMSA in all infantile febrile UTI cases.

In all, 19 patients with VUR and hypocompliant bladders (mean age 11.4 years, range 5-21) had augmentation ileocystoplasty. Lower urinary tract function was assessed before surgery and at 3 and 6 months afterward with VUD. Symptomatic febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) and progressive renal scarring on scintigraphy were retrospectively evaluated in all patients. VUR persisted in nine patients despite a low-pressure bladder. In all patients with persistent VUR, VUD at 6 months after surgery showed that VUR started at low bladder volumes (mean 29.6 mL, range 19-52) and low pressures (mean 14.6 cmH(2)O, range 9.6-25) when compared to the group with no persistent VUR. Before surgery VUD showed that reflux started at the beginning of the filling phase (mean 14.8 mL, range 8-33) with very low intravesical pressures (mean 7.8 cmH(2)O, range 4-17) in these nine patients. During the follow-up febrile UTIs were significantly more frequent in the group with persistent VUR. One patient had progressive renal scarring on scintigraphy after cystoplasty. Preoperative VUD findings might be a very important predictor of the spontaneous resolution of VUR. In these patients concomitant VUR should be corrected simultaneously during bladder augmentation if it starts at low pressures on preoperative VUD, as persistence of VUR can induce scarring from febrile UTIs."}

Emphysematous urinary tract infection (EUTI) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt evaluation and management. This study was conducted to ascertain the clinical features and prognostic factors of EUTI. Patients diagnosed with EUTI radiologically and treated at the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, from March 2001 to February 2007 were evaluated. The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, treatment, and outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. Of 31 patients enrolled, 16 had emphysematous pyelonephritis (EP) and 15 had emphysematous cystitis (EC) classified according to the imaging findings. The symptoms and signs of fever, chills, flank pain, and percussion tenderness at the costovertebral angle were significantly greater among patients in the EP group than in the EC group (p = 0.029, p = 0.009, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the initial laboratory data except for C-reactive protein between the 2 groups (220.4 microg/mL vs 91.4 microg/mL; p = 0.001). Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated organism. The overall mortality rate was similar in both groups. Significant differences in renal function and hematuria were seen between the patients who died and the survivors in the EP group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.027, respectively), but these were not noted in the EC group. There was no significant clinical feature suggesting the presence of EC. The clinical features of EP were similar to uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Impaired renal function and hematuria were poor prognostic factors for patients with EP, but not for patients with EC."}

Renovascular hypertension in children is a very rare illness. It occurs as a result of the imbalance between hypotensive and hypertensive systems. Renal ischaemia (95% of the cases) and the shortening of hipotensive factors (5% of the cases) are responsible for the production mechanism of renovascular hypertension in children. In order to make an early diagnosis regarding the renovascular hypertension in all children suffering from renovascular illnesses, blood pressure must be taken correctly and repeatedly. This paper is a case study on 19 children with renovascular hypertension, aged between 2 and 15 years old. Most cases were divided into two groups: subjects aged 4-7 years old and subjects aged 8-12 years old. Each group represents 34.2% of all cases. The diagnosis of renovascular hypertension in those 19 children was established after correctly taking the blood pressure and comparing it with the normal values for each age. Hypertension was diagnosed before knowing its cause in 8 neglected cases. The blood pressure was repeatedly taken in the other 11 children suffering from renovascular illnesses and the diagnosis of hypertension was early established when blood pressure values increased. Previously, blood pressure was normal in these 11 cases. The etiopathogenical diagnosis showed parenchymal diseases in 12 cases--63.1%. Seven patients suffered from renovascular lesions--36.9%. Laboratory exams, radiology, imagistic exams, arteriography and scintigraphy were steps taken in order to establish the etiopathogenical diagnosis. These exams showed the next direct causes of renovascular hypertension: bilateral chronic pyelonephritis in 4 cases--21.4%, hydronephrosis in 3 cases--16.2%, congenital renal hypoplasia in 2 cases--10.4% and doubled kidney in 2 cases--10.4%. The other 8 cases presented acute glomerulonephritis, unilateral renal agenesis, horseshoe kidney, unilateral pyelonephritis, renal artery agenesis, renal trauma, renal abcess and Wilms tumor, one case of each illness--5.2%. The major complications were: retinopathy, chronic renal failure and stroke. Laboratory data are just a hint in diagnosing renovascular hypertension. However, radiology, imagistic exams, arteriography and scintigraphy are compulsory in the renourinary status and etiopathogenical diagnosis."}

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children might, in a minority of cases, cause renal scarring and permanent damage. Known risk factors for renal damage are: obstruction to urinary flow, vesicoureteric reflux and recurrent infections. The current recommendations for imaging and follow-up of children with first febrile UTI include renal ultrasound to rule out anatomic abnormalities, particularly obstruction, cystography for possible diagnosis of vesicoureteric reflux, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrent infections in children with detected reflux. DMSA renal scanning for the detection of renal scars is recommended as part of the imaging protocol by some institutions. Recently, published data doubts the importance of the various imaging techniques, as well as the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. In the current review, the role of renal ultrasound is examined, especially with regards to familiar data from fetal ultrasound. The complex relationship between vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring is presented, with the possible implications on the importance of performing routine cystography and DMSA scanning after UTI. Studies questioning the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic therapy emphasize the importance of rapid diagnosis and therapy of suspected recurrent UTI as the preferred approach to prevent renal damage. Imaging studies are only recommended for high risk groups and not as a routine following UTI."}

The aim of the present prospective trial was to investigate, in a cohort of young children with first urinary tract infection (UTI) and negative prenatal history, the role of imaging in screening babies at risk of renal deterioration. Children who had experienced the first febrile UTI at or under the age of 2 years were enrolled. They had had normal foetal routine ultrasound. All the children underwent renal ultrasound after admission; those with sonographic signs of obstruction were excluded. Voiding cystoureterogram (VCUG) and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy were performed approximately 1 month and 6 months after the UTI, respectively. Finally, 65 babies (47.7% males, 38.6 +/- 1.3 weeks of gestational age) were prospectively followed up. In 15.4% and 29.2% of cases, the renal pelvis was < or =7 and >7 mm in diameter, respectively. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was detected in 55.4% of the children and renal scarring in 18.5%. Stepwise binary logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of VUR correlated significantly with renal scarring, excluding all the other variables from the model. In this cohort of babies, the severity of VUR seriously enhanced the risk of renal damage (odds ratio = 6.658, p = 0.004). Follow-up renal scintigraphy 6 months after a UTI can predict severe VUR in very young children showing renal scarring, detecting only those who are at risk of loss of kidney function and who would require further assessment. After the first episode of UTI, the practice of performing VCUG in babies with normal DMSA scintigraphy is of doubtful value."}

We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for prospective studies involving children with culture-proven UTIs. Additional eligibility criteria were measurement of serum PCT at presentation and performance of DMSA scintigraphy within 14 days. Overall, 10 studies eligible for inclusion, involving a total of 627 children, were identified. Half of these studies evaluated children with a first episode of UTI; 8 involved children with febrile UTIs. Using a cutoff value of 0.5 to 0.6 ng/mL, the pooled diagnostic odds ratio of serum PCT for UTI with RPI was 14.25 (95% confidence interval, 4.70 to 43.23). High statistical between-study heterogeneity that could mainly be attributed to 2 studies was observed. The remaining 8 studies uniformly favored PCT use. In children with culture-proven UTI, a serum PCT value >0.5 ng/mL predicts reasonably well the presence of RPI, as evidenced by DMSA scintigraphy. PCT may aid in the identification of children with UTI, necessitating more intense evaluation and management."}

Values for nutritional and inflammatory markers were analyzed together with RDUV. In total, 670 of 704 patients (95.2%) with HD duration greater than 1 year had abnormal RDUV (<500 ml). Patients with higher RRF were younger, had shorter HD duration, higher prevalence of hypertension and levels of serum albumin, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and lower mid-week inter-dialysis body weight increase (MIBWI), cardio-thoracic ratio, levels of intact parathyroid hormone, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs CRP), and KT/V (Daugirdes) values than those with low RRF. Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that RRF was positively correlated with serum albumin, HDL levels, and presence of hypertension, and negatively correlated with age, HD duration, and MIBWI in MHD patients. Moreover, after adjusting factors that were significantly related to serum albumin or Hs CRP, RRF was still positively correlated with serum albumin (0.000137 +/- 0.000585, p = 0.0197) and negatively correlated with log Hs CRP (-0.000184 +/- 0.000952, p = 0.0533). A one-liter increase in RDUV was associated with a 1.4 g/L increase in serum albumin level in MHD patients. This clinical study first demonstrated that RRF affects nutritional and inflammatory status in MHD patients. Because malnutrition and inflammation can cause high mortality in MHD patients, preserving RRF is important for these patients."}

Differentiation of serious bacterial infection (SBI) from self-limiting viral illness in febrile infants younger than three months is a significant challenge for clinicians. We aimed to assess the risk factors for SBI in febrile infants. Data were obtained from 221 infants younger than three months who visited a single community referral hospital for fever and underwent a complete sepsis workup between August 2003 and July 2006. The causes of fever were febrile illness without a documented cause (FISDC, 65%), urinary tract infection (UTI, 12%), aseptic meningitis (12%), bacteremia (4%), bacterial meningitis (2%). Cerebrospinal fluid enterovirus polymerase chain reaction was positive in 28% of FISDC and 48% of aseptic meningitis cases. When UTI was excluded, the risk factors for SBI were 1) C-reactive protein (CRP) level of > or =1.87 mg/dL and 2) fevers of > or =38.9 degrees C. The specificity and negative predictive values of risk factors 1) and 2) for the diagnosis of SBI were 94% and 95%, respectively. We concluded that enteroviral infection may be a major cause of febrile episodes in infants younger than three months. If UTI could be excluded, the presence of CRP levels > or =1.87 mg/dL and fevers of > or =38.9 degrees C can be used as criteria to rule out SBI in these infants."}

Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder that can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends that treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha be considered in patients with moderate to severe CD refractory to concomitant aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive treatment, or who have contraindications to or poor tolerance of these agents. Anti-TNF-alpha agents available in the United States for the management of CD are infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol. The latter is a recombinant humanized antibody Fab' fragment against TNF-alpha. It is conjugated with a 40-kDa polyethylene glycol molecule to increase the t(1/2) of the treatment to approximately 2 weeks. The objective of this review was to extract and assess all relevant available data on the efficacy and tolerability of certolizumab pegol in the treatment of CD. Searches of MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1985 to March 3, 2009, were conducted using the key terms certolizumab pegol, CDP870, and Crohn's disease. Data from all available clinical trials published in English and ongoing trials were included in this review. The reference lists of the identified articles were searched for additional references. Data from abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the American College of Gastroenterology and Digestive Disease Week from 2004 to 2008 were reviewed and included if relevant. A total of 8 studies were included in this review (1474 patients). In Phase II trials, there were no significant differences between certolizumab pegol and inactive vehicle (placebo) in week-4 or week-12 clinical response or remission rates. In the first of 2 Phase III clinical trials, certolizumab pegol was associated with significantly greater rates of response compared with placebo at weeks 6 (37% vs 26%; P = 0.04) and 26 (22% vs 12%; P = 0.05) of induction treatment (data from patients with baseline CRP concentrations > or =10 mg/L). Response was defined as a decrease from baseline in CD activity index > or =100 at week 6 and at both weeks 6 and 26 in patients with baseline C-reactive protein > or =10 mg/L. Remission rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In the second Phase III trial, the proportion of patients in whom response was sustained up to 26 weeks was significantly greater with certolizumab pegol compared with placebo (63% vs 36%; P < 0.001). The tolerability profile of certolizumab pegol was similar to those of other anti-TNF-alpha agents and included an increased risk for infections (including opportunistic infections [eg, tuberculosis]) compared with placebo. Infusion and injection-site reactions were infrequent (3%) with certolizumab pegol treatment. The most common adverse events reported with certolizumab pegol treatment included upper respiratory infection (20%), immunogenicity (8%), and urinary tract infection (7%). No new unanticipated adverse events emerged during the 30-month tolerability follow-up. Certolizumab pegol is being assessed in patients with CD refractory to other medications, including other biologic agents. Based on the findings from the present review, certolizumab pegol had moderate efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe, active CD. In well-designed Phase III clinical trials, certolizumab pegol was associated with significantly greater response rates compared with placebo at weeks 6 and 26 of induction treatment. In patients who responded to the 6-week induction, certolizumab pegol administered as a monthly subcutaneous injection was effective in maintaining CD response and remission. Findings from studies of certolizumab pegol in refractory CD are awaited."}

The mean age of children with renal scarring was also significantly lower than those without scarring (P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed that the highest initial IL-8 values, age <20 months and reflux grades > or =III all were independent predictors of renal scarring. Those children younger than 2 years of age with the highest IL-8 concentrations during the acute phase of pyelonephritis as well as children with reflux grades of III or greater are at a high-risk for developing renal scarring in the future."}

Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a protein identified in human neutrophil granules. The aim of the study was to assess whether urine level of NGAL (uNGAL) could represent a novel, reliable marker of urinary tract infection (UTI) and to determine the optimal cutoff level for uNGAL to predict UTI in children. Sixty patients with symptomatic UTI and 29 healthy controls were enrolled the study. Urine NGAL was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) radionuclide scan was performed within 7 days in the patients with UTI in an attempt to distinguish pyelonephritis from cystitis. Mean uNGAL level was significantly higher in the UTI group than in the controls (91.02 ng/ml vs 14.29 ng/ml, p = 0.0001) and using a cutoff 20 ng/ml for uNGAL for diagnosis of UTI, sensitivity, and specificity were 97% and 76%, respectively [area under the curve (AUC): 0.979]. Mean uNGAL/creatinine ratio (uNGAL/Cr) was also significantly higher in the UTI group [201.81 ng/mg creatinine (Cr) vs 18.08 ng/mg Cr; p = 0.0001], and using a cutoff 30 ng/mg Cr for uNGAL/Cr for diagnosis of UTI, sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 76%, respectively (AUC: 0.992). In conclusion, both uNGAL and uNGAL/Cr can be used as a novel, sensitive marker for early prediction of UTI in the absence of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, and the optimal cutoff value for prediction of UTI is lower than the values determined for acute kidney injury. Further investigations with larger patient groups are required to confirm our results."}

The accuracy of using body temperature, serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the work-up for early or late step-down therapy after an initial course of intravenous cefuroxime was investigated. Eighty-one hospitalized patients with an initial course of cefuroxime were retrospectively classified with one of the following diagnoses: bacterial infection without known focus, pneumonia, bronchitis, pyelonephritis, skin and soft-tissue infections or fever of other origin. The majority of the patients had sepsis (91% or 74/81) of whom 6 patients had severe sepsis. The inter-individual variability of body temperature, SAA, CRP and IL-6 was considerable. The time course of SAA and CRP during the first 24 h in patients with sepsis with a short duration of illness but without septic shock showed increasing levels during the initial course of intravenous therapy. In contrast, body temperature and IL-6 decreased, regardless of illness duration. Beyond 24 h, all 4 biomarkers declined, again regardless of the duration of illness. After the initial course of cefuroxime, biomarkers were non-distinguishing in terms of guidance in the judgement of early or late step-down therapy. Further studies are proposed for biomarker guidance antibiotic therapy in sepsis patients without septic shock."}

Different acquisition methods have been used: planar parallel-hole or pinhole collimation and single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Publications support the superiority of each; few comparative studies have been reported, with mixed results. We have compared planar parallel-hole cortical scintigraphy and dual-head SPECT for detection of cortical defects. Forty patients (37 children, 3 adults; 9 male, 31 female) were imaged 3 hours after injection of (99m)Tc-DMSA with dual-head SPECT and planar imaging (posterior, left, and right posterior oblique views with a parallel-hole collimator). For each patient, planar and SPECT images were evaluated at different sittings, in random order, by three independent observers. Twelve cortical segments were scored as normal or reduced uptake. The linear correlation coefficient for the number of abnormal segments detected between readers, techniques, and segments was calculated. No significant difference was seen in the average number of abnormal segments detected by planar versus SPECT imaging; 2.1 for planar imaging and 2.2 for SPECT (p = 0.84, two-tailed). For all observers, the average correlation coefficient for SPECT alone, planar imaging alone, and between techniques (SPECT vs planar imaging) was high (r = 0.93-0.94). Applying nonparametric Spearman's rank analysis, the average correlation remained high (r = 0.70-0.75). Correlation between readers, techniques, and segments for methods and readers was also good (r = 0.69-0.77).

Medical records and radiologic studies of children (<2 years) suffering their first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) between January 2001 and May 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of US and DMSA scans in diagnosing VUR. Among 220 children with their first febrile UTI, VUR was detected in 67 (30.4%). The detection rate of VUR by US was 41.7% and 86% in the low (I, II) and high grade (III~IV) groups, respectively. Detection rate of VUR by DMSA scan was 37.5% and 88.4% in the low and high grade groups, respectively. Combining US and DMSA scan, we found that the detection rate of high grade VUR was 95.3% and that of low grade was 62.5%. During follow up, most of the low grade VURs with normal DMSA and US scans resolved or were downgraded. Most high grade VURs could be detected by US and DMSA scan, but the prediction rate was not as high in low grade VURs. However, we can anticipate spontaneous improvement without complications in patients with either low or high grade reflux and negative findings on US and DMSA scan."}

We identified children in the Northern health region of the UK who had been seen to develop scars, identified as new defects on dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scanning. Risk factors were sought by reviewing case-notes and interviews with parents. Twenty girls were identified whose new scarring was strongly associated with having both vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and a UTI (p = 0.0001); 19/23 (83%) of kidneys exposed to both of these factors developed scars. Children were much more likely to be febrile (94 vs. 30%, p < 0.0001) or unwell (82 vs. 10%, p < 0.0001) during their earlier UTIs when they were of median age 2.8 years (range 0.3-5.0 years) and did not scar, compared to their later UTIs at age 7.3 years (1.2-12.5 years), when they did scar. However, most patients were treated within 1 day of their symptoms for their early UTIs, compared to a wait >or=7 days for later UTIs (p = 0.001). Being febrile or unwell during a UTI does not predict the development of scars, but prompt treatment appears to prevent scarring in children with VUR."}

Between 1999 and 2002, all children 0 to 14 years of age consecutively seen with a first febrile urinary tract infection were enrolled in the study. (99m)Tc-Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy was performed within 5 days after admission for the detection of renal parenchymal involvement. The presence of vesicoureteral reflux was assessed by using cystography performed 1 month after the infection. If the acute scan results were abnormal, then follow-up (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning was performed after 6 months, to assess the frequency of scars. A total of 316 children were enrolled in the study (190 children <1 year, 99 children 1-4 years, and 27 children 5-14 years of age). (99m)Tc-Dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy revealed that 59% of the children had renal involvement in the acute phase of infection. The frequency of kidney involvement in infants <1 year of age (49%) was significantly lower than that in children 1 to 4 years of age (73%) and >5 years of age (81%). Of the 187 children with positive acute (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan results, 123 underwent repeat scintigraphy after 6 months. Renal scars were found for 28% of children <1 year, 37% of children 1 to 4 years, and 53% of children 5 to 14 years of age. No significant differences in the frequency of scars and the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux were noted. Our findings confirm that acute pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring occur only in some children with first febrile urinary tract infections.

We collected the following: Patient age, clinical presentation, perioperative data, complications, length of hospital stay, and outcome. Preoperative evaluation of UPJO always included an injected renal CT scan and furosemide-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG-3) renal scintigraphy. Patients were seen at 3 and 6 months after surgery and once a year thereafter. Postoperative success was defined as symptomatic response and radiographic evidence of no further obstruction. Twenty patients with a mean age of 36.8 +/- 16 years (range 15-69 yr) were included. Six (30%) patients had previously undergone endoscopic treatment. The mean operative time was 150.3 +/- 36.22 minutes (range 150-240 min). The mean follow-up was 19.9 +/- 10.03 months (range 3-37 mos). Two (10%) procedures necessitated conversion to laparoscopic procedures, and there was no conversion to laparotomy. Four (20%) patients experienced minor complications: Two urinary tract infections and two urinomas. Repeated early surgery was needed in one patient for temporary (ie, 8 days) stent placement in the case of urinoma. There was no recurrence of the UPJO, and no repeated surgery was deemed necessary during the follow-up period. The success rate was estimated to be 95%. Functional outcomes after robot-assisted procedures for alleviation of UPJO are very promising. Our data showed that the robot-assisted procedure was safe and featured negligible morbidity.

Infants < 6 months old with their first UTI from January 2001 to December 2006 having undergone an ultrasound examination of the urinary tract, a micturating cystourethrogram, and a late di-mercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, were included. Their condition was evaluated against a set of risk features according to the UTI guidelines. Those having any one of these were classified as atypical and those having none as typical. There were 134 infants reviewed, with a typical (98 infants) to atypical (36 infants) ratio of 2.7 to 1. Girls were found to be relatively more represented in the atypical group [male (M):female (F) = 1.3:1] than in the typical group (M:F = 4.4:1) (P < 0.004). There were significantly more infants with abnormal micturating voiding cystourethrograms (MCUGs) (P = 0.007), more refluxing ureters (P < 0.001) and more significant vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) (>/= grade III) (P = 0.013) in the atypical group than in the typical group; while there was no significant difference in ultrasound (US) and DMSA scan findings between the two groups. In the atypical group there was no difference in imaging studies (and, thus, the results) between the conventional practice and the NICE UTI recommendation. In the typical group, if the recommendations of the guidelines had been followed (i.e. only those with abnormal US would have been further investigated), 25 refluxing ureters and 22 scarred kidneys would have been left undiagnosed. In conclusion, application of the suggested selective imaging approach would leave a significant number of VUR and renal scars undiagnosed, and it may not be an optimal practice for infants less than 6 months old with their first UTI. The best approach remains to be clarified."}

ANTECEDENTS AND OBJECTIVES: The location of the urinary tract infection in children has serious implications both in therapy and prognosis. Affectation in gammagraphic studies is considered the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Several studies with biomarkers have been made with controverted results. The objective of this study is to set the utility of beta2-microglobuline, alfa1-microglobuline, Cistatine C, IgG and albumin in the location of the infection, through the analysis of the relation among their urinary excretion, clinical and laboratory parameters and the renal scintigraphy findings. Prospective observational study made in 40 patients, aged from 1 month to 11 years, after their Hospital admission with suspicion for acute pyelonephritis. Exclusion criteria were: decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, malnutrition, massive albuminuria and history or findings of nephrourologic disease. Clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed, and renal ultrasonography and scintigraphy were performed within the first seven days after admission. Once the fever dropped, the urinary creatinine-protein ratio was analyzed. After the acute process, a renal scintigraphy was performed in order to detect renal scars. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test has been used as the statistical hypothesis test, and Chi-square and Fisher s exact tests have been used to compare the qualitative variables. The glomerular filtration rate, as well as the ultrasonography scan, was normal in all patients. 45% of the children (24/80 kidneys) had scintigraphic alterations that were compatible with acute pyelonephritis, and there were not differences in proteinuria between these and those with normal scintigraphy. To greater age greater probability of scintigraphic affectation. The sensitivity and specificity of leukocytes and CRP to predict pyelonephritis were 77-65% and 94-52%, r = 0.70 (CI 95% 0.54-0.87) y 0.75 (CI 95% 0.60-0.90) respectively. An apparent relation between the maximum temperature or duration of the symptoms and the renal affectation does not exist. In all the children, the normality of urinary markers of renal function was confirmed once the acute phase had passed, even in those 3 patients with renal scars (7.5%). Renal scintigraphy is still being the reference pattern for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in Pediatrics. The combined use of different urinary markers of renal function does not increase its sensitivity. It is necessary to do research in order to confirm the utility of new biomarkers."}

This study was conducted from March 2006 to December 2007 on children with confirmed diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. They all had positive renal scintigraphy scans for pyelonephritis and leukocyturia. The ratios of urinary TNF-alpha to urine creatinine level were determined and compared in patients before and after antibiotic therapy. Eighty-two children (13 boys and 69 girls) with acute pyelonephritis were evaluated. The mean pretreatment ratio of urinary TNF-alpha to urinary creatinine level was higher than that 3 days after starting on empirical treatment (P = .03). The sensitivity of this parameter was 91% for diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis when compared with demercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy as gold standard. Based on our findings in children, the level of urinary TNF-alpha-creatinine ratio is acute increased in pyelonephritis and it decreases after appropriate therapy with a high sensitivity for early diagnosis of the disease.

All children younger than 10 years old who presented to a local hospital in Hong Kong between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 2006, with culture-confirmed UTI and who subsequently underwent DMSA scintigraphy, ultrasound, and MCU were identified. For the purpose of this study, patients with underlying major congenital urinary tract abnormalities were excluded. DMSA scintigraphy was regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of renal scarring. DMSA scintigraphy, ultrasound, and MCU findings and clinical outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. A total of 583 children were included in the study. Of these, 432 children (74.1%) had normal findings on ultrasound and on MCU. Only 13 children (3%) of this group had renal scarring as shown on DMSA scintigraphy. The overall negative predictive value (NPV) for excluding renal scarring of combined ultrasound and MCU reached 97%. The NPV was 97.7% in the subgroup of patients 0 to 2 years old. For children younger than 2 years with UTI in the absence of underlying major congenital urinary tract abnormalities, we recommend that DMSA scintigraphy may be withheld if findings on both ultrasound and MCU examinations are normal."}

The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors associated with different extents of renal parenchyma involvement in a paediatric series of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). A total of 549 patients with VUR were analyzed. The variable of interest was renal scar, assessed by technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan, and classified into three subtypes: focal scar, multiple cortical scarring and diffuse scars with a contracted renal unit. The multinomial regression model was applied to identify independent variables associated with each subtype of renal damage. After adjustment, four variables remained independently associated with a contracted renal unit: reflux grades III-V (odds ratio (OR)=9.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.1-21.0), age at diagnosis (OR=3; 95% CI=1.6-5.1), unilateral reflux (OR=2.1; 95% CI=1.2-3.8), and male sex (OR=2; 95% CI=1.1-3.8). Two variables were associated with multiple scars: reflux grades III-V (OR=13.8; 95% CI=7.4-26.0) and age at diagnosis (OR=1.9; 95% CI=1.2-3.0). Two variables were associated with a focal scar: reflux grades III-V (OR=7.9, 95% CI CI=3.8-16.4) and male sex as a protective factor (OR=0.5; 95% CI=0.25-1.0). Our findings suggest that the development of a contracted renal unit is probably due to congenital malformation, more commonly observed in male infants with high-grade reflux."}

The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that the urinary excretion of C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1-microglobulin (A1M), retinol-binding protein (RBP) and Clara cell protein (CC16) is increased in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) and relates to renal damage as measured by acute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Fifty-two children <2 years of age with UTI were enrolled in the study, 44 of whom were febrile. The control group consisted of 23 patients with non-UTI infection and elevated serum CRP (s-CRP) levels. Thirty-six patients had abnormal DMSA uptake, classified as mild, moderate or severe damage (DMSA class 1, 2, 3, respectively). There was a significant association between DMSA class and the excretion of urinary RBP (u-RBP) and u-CC16. There was also a significant difference in u-CRP levels between children with UTI and control children with non-UTI infections, although u-CRP excretion was not significantly correlated to DMSA class. In conclusion, the urinary excretion of the low-molecular-weight proteins RBP and CC16 showed a strong association with uptake defects on renal DMSA scans. The urinary level of CRP seems to distinguish between children with UTI and other febrile conditions. A combination of these biomarkers may be useful in the clinical assessment of children with UTI."}

To assess the outcome of emergency nephrectomy in a retrospective, multicentre analysis, as emergency nephrectomy due to life-threatening urosepsis is a rare clinical scenario with a high mortality, and there are few reports of clinical data on this issue. We assessed retrospectively all patients who had a nephrectomy due to life-threatening urosepsis in three referral centres in Vienna between 1994 and 2007. Patient characteristics, survival and risk factors for a fatal outcome were evaluated. In all 65 patients (44 women and 21 men; mean age 65 years) were analysed. The mean interval from the first medical consultation to hospital admission was 4.3 days. Two-thirds of patients were admitted directly from their homes (63%), the remainder being transferred from other departments or hospitals. The most common pathological mechanism leading to urosepsis was acute pyelonephritis, often combined with nephrolithiasis. In all, 36 patients had a urological intervention before nephrectomy, i.e. percutaneous nephrostomy in 17, ureteric stent in 16 and percutaneous abscess drainage in three. Nephrectomy was performed a mean (range) of 5.7 (0-31) days after hospital admission. Thirteen patients (20%) died from septic multi-organ failure after surgery. This group was almost 20 years older than those who survived (78.6 vs 61.8 years), had a higher comorbidity rate, had undergone endourological interventions more frequently (69% vs 52%), had a longer interval to nephrectomy (6.9 vs 5.4 days), higher C-reactive protein level (294.9 vs 136.0 mg/L) and lower platelet counts (229.5 vs 307.7 million/L) at diagnosis. Several factors were identified that influence the outcome after emergency nephrectomy for life-threatening urosepsis. Applied to the decision-making process, these risk factors could have a positive impact on establishing a timely indication for nephrectomy that might ultimately reduce the high mortality rate."}

Brucellosis which is a endemic in Turkey, is a systemic infection which can affect any organ or system in the body. Since signs and symptoms of brucellosis resemble many other diseases, misdiagnosis and related increase in morbidity rate, are common. In this report, a case of brucellosis complicated with endocarditis, pyelonephritis, sacroileitis and thyroiditis, was presented. The case was a 32-years-old female patient in whom the diagnosis of brucellosis was delayed by 12 months since it was not taken into consideration during the clinical follow-up of the patient in various clinical centers. The patient was admitted to our center with the complaints of fever, headache, back pain, night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, dysuria and polyuria. The patient had a history of consumption of raw milk and dairy products. Positive Brucella tube agglutination test (1/1280) and isolation of Brucella spp. in blood cultures led to the diagnosis of brucellosis. Sacroileitis was diagnosed upon pain on right hip joint movements, pain and restriction at the same joint in FABER test. The detection of vegetation during echocardiography, cardiac murmur during physical examination and the determination of increased ESR and CRP levels led to the diagnosis of endocarditis. Abdominal ultrasonography and urinalysis results (hematuria, proteinuria and pyuria) revealed pyelonephritis and increased free T3 and T4, decreased TSH and positive anti-thyroid autoantibodies (anti-TG, anti-TPO) revealed thyroiditis. Treatment was started with combination of rifampisin (1 x 600 mg/day) and doxycycline (2 x 100 mg/day). After the diagnosis of endocarditis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (3 x 960 mg/day) and streptomycin (1 x 1 g/day) were added to the treatment. Valve replacement surgery was planned, however, the patient didn't accept surgical intervention and antimicrobial treatment continued with streptomycin for 21 days and other antibiotics for six months. The patient exhibited significant improvement after the medical treatment. Although sacroileitis is a frequent complication of brucellosis, endocarditis, thyroiditis and pyelonephritis are among the rare complications. In cases of brucellosis with multiorgan involvement including endocarditis, successful results may be achieved by aggressive antimicrobial treatment. In endemic areas, brucellosis should always be taken into consideration in patients with fever of unknown origin and multisystem involvement."}

Psoas abscesses are suppurative collections within the fascia surrounding the psoas and iliacus muscles. In this retrospective study it was aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings and treatment outcomes of 15 psoas abscess cases admitted to Baskent University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey during June 2003-January 2008 period. The mean age of the patients was 55.8 years (range 18 to 70 years) with a female to male ratio of 5/10. Thirteen of the cases (86.5%) were admitted with the complaints of fever and back pain. Thirteen of the cases were diagnosed by abdominal computerized tomography while the other two by abdominal ultrasonography. One of the 15 patients was considered as primary psoas abscess, while the remaining 14 as secondary psoas abscess. The most common accompanying disease was diabetes mellitus (66.6%). Fourteen patients with secondary psoas abscess had vertebral osteomyelitis which was due to tuberculosis in five cases, to urinary tract infection in five cases, to pneumoniae in two cases, to surgical infection in one case and to brucellosis in one case. The cultivation of the abscess material from the 14 secondary psoas abscess cases revealed growth of bacteria in 11 of them (5 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 1 methicilin-resistant S. aureus, 1 Acinetobacter baumannii, 1 Brucella melitensis, 1 Serratia marcescens). The biochemical parameters of the cases (mean leukocyte counts: 14.500 cell/mm3; mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates: 78 mm/hour; mean C-reactive protein levels: 108 mg/dl) were also high. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage and received appropriate antibiotic treatment and the other two patients were treated with open surgical debridement. The duration of antimicrobial treatment was one year for M. tuberculosis cases and about 4-6 weeks in the others. One of the cases died due to complicating meningitis and sepsis. It is remarkable that in our series none of the psoas abscess cases were secondary to the diseases of the digestive tract unlike the series indicated in the literature. The isolation of M. tuberculosis as the causative agent in 5 (33.3%) cases emphasizes the fact that tuberculosis is still an important public health problem in Turkey."}

To describe the variability in outcomes and care processes for children hospitalized for urinary tract infection (UTI), and to identify patient and hospital factors that may account for variability. Retrospective cohort of children 1 month to 12 years of age hospitalized for UTI at 25 children's hospitals from 1999 to 2004. We measured variability in length-of-stay (LOS), cost, readmission rate, intensive care unit admission, and performance of renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram and identified patient and hospital factors associated with these outcomes. The cohort included 20,892 children. There was significant variation in outcomes and processes of care across hospitals (eg, mean LOS, 2.1-5.0 days; patients with both imaging tests performed, 0.3%-72.9%). Older children had shorter LOS and were less likely to undergo imaging. Patients hospitalized at high volume hospitals were more likely to undergo imaging. Hospitals with high percentage of Medicaid patients had longer LOS and were less likely to perform imaging tests. Hospitals with a clinical practice guideline for UTI had shorter LOS and decreased costs per admission. The variability across hospitals may represent opportunities for benchmarking, standardization, and quality improvement. Decreased LOS and costs associated with clinical practice guidelines support their implementation."}

This prospective observational study included 115 infants (80 boys and 35 girls) younger than 1 year with grade III to V vesicoureteral reflux. The diagnosis was made after prenatal ultrasound in 26% of the patients and after urinary tract infection in 71%. Patients were followed by renal scintigraphy, 51chromium edetic acid clearance and video cystometry. Median followup was 62 months. Renal abnormality, which was found in 90% of the children at followup, was generalized in 71% and focal in 29%. The abnormality was bilateral in 28% of the affected patients. Total glomerular filtration rate was less than 80% of expected in 30% of the patients. Single kidney function was less than 40% of expected total glomerular filtration rate in 71% of the patients. Renal status (parenchymal abnormality and function) remained unchanged through time in 84 of 108 available cases (78%), improved in 5 (5%) and deteriorated in 19 (18%). Predictive factors for deterioration were recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, bilateral abnormality and reduced total glomerular filtration rate. Deteriorated renal status was more common in cases diagnosed prenatally than in those detected after urinary tract infection. Among these infants with high grade vesicoureteral reflux renal abnormality was frequent and was associated with subnormal filtration of one of the kidneys. Decreased total glomerular filtration rate was seen in about a third of the patients. Overall deterioration of renal status was seen in only a fifth of the patients. Infection control seems to be an important factor to minimize the risk."}

(99m)Technetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scans are ideal for demonstrating renal scarring in children with spina bifida. However, doubt persists about the need for routine application. We assessed the associations among abnormal (99m)technetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scans, vesicoureteral reflux and urodynamic findings in patients with spina bifida during long-term followup. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 64 patients with spina bifida followed at our center. All patients were older than 10 years (mean 15.8, range 10 to 23). Dimercapto-succinic acid renal scans were considered abnormal with differential function of less than 40% or focal defects. Patient age, gender, previous febrile urinary tract infections, positive vesicoureteral reflux history, timing of clean intermittent catheterization initiation and the latest urodynamic findings were noted. Patients were grouped based on normal/abnormal scan results. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate regression analyses and chi-square tests. A total of 16 patients (25%) had abnormal scans. Mean patient age, male-to-female ratio, leak point pressure, bladder compliance and timing of clean intermittent catheterization initiation did not differ between groups. Rates of previous febrile urinary tract infections differed significantly (11 of 16 in the abnormal group vs 9 of 48 in the normal group, p <0.01), as did positive reflux history (100% vs 31%, p <0.01). No patient with a negative reflux history had an abnormal dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan. Multivariate analysis identified previous febrile urinary tract infections as a significant risk factor for an abnormal scan. A positive vesicoureteral reflux history and febrile urinary tract infections were associated with abnormal dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan in followup of patients older than 10 years with spina bifida. Thus, these factors are indicators of proactive evaluation of renal function using dimercapto-succinic acid renal scanning."}

To describe the microbiology and outcome of iliopsoas abscess (IPA) in a large case series, we analyzed 124 cases of IPA collected from 1990 through 2004 in 11 hospitals in Spain. Twenty-seven (21.8%) patients had primary and 97 (78.2%) had secondary IPA. The main sources of infection were bone (50.5%), gastrointestinal tract (24.7%), and urinary tract (17.5%). A definitive microbial diagnosis was achieved in 93 (75%) cases. Abscess culture was the most frequent procedure leading to microbial diagnosis, followed by blood cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides species were the most frequent microbial causes: S. aureus was the most common organism in patients with primary abscesses (42.9%) and with abscesses of skeletal origin (35.2%), whereas E. coli was the leading organism in those with abscesses of urinary (61.5%) and gastrointestinal (42.1%) tracts. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 15 patients, 4 of them associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Twenty (21.5%) cases had polymicrobial infections; these were more common among patients with abscesses of gastrointestinal origin. Information on clinical outcome was available for 120 patients; 19 (15.8%) had a relapse and 6 (5%) died due to complications related to the IPA. Patients who died were older and more likely to have bacteremia and E. coli isolated from cultures. In conclusion, secondary IPA is more prevalent than primary IPA. Among those with secondary IPA, most abscesses are secondary to a skeletal source. A bacterial etiology can be identified in most cases. The overall prognosis of patients with this condition is good."}

Escherichia coli strains, in general, do not ferment cellobiose and aryl-beta-D-glucosidic sugars, although \"cryptic\" beta-d-glucoside systems have been characterized. Here we describe an additional cryptic operon (bgc) for the utilization of cellobiose and the aryl-beta-d-glucosides arbutin and salicin at low temperature. The bgc operon was identified by the characterization of beta-glucoside-positive mutants of an E. coli septicemia strain (i484) in which the well-studied bgl (aryl-beta-d-glucoside) operon was deleted. These bgc* mutants appeared after 5 days of incubation on salicin indicator plates at 28 degrees C. The bgc operon codes for proteins homologous to beta-glucoside/cellobiose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransfer system permease subunits IIB (BgcE), IIC (BgcF), and IIA (BgcI); a porin (BgcH); and a phospho-beta-D-glucosidase (BgcA). Next to the bgc operon maps the divergent bgcR gene, which encodes a GntR-type transcriptional regulator. Expression of the bgc operon is dependent on the cyclic-AMP-dependent regulator protein CRP and positively controlled by BgcR. In the bgc* mutants, a single nucleotide exchange enhances the activity of the bgc promoter, rendering it BgcR independent. Typing of a representative collection of E. coli demonstrated the prevalence of bgc in strains of phylogenetic group B2, representing mainly extraintestinal pathogens, while it is rare among commensal E. coli strains. The bgc locus is also present in the closely related species Escherichia albertii. Further, bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that homologs of the bgc genes exist in the enterobacterial Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter spp. and also in gram-positive bacteria, indicative of horizontal gene transfer events."}

We studied 462 full-term neonates for UTI. They were aged 3-25 days, with either high (>10 mg/dL) or prolonged (>10 days) hyperbilirubinemia, with or without manifestations such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, poor feeding, lethargy, and irritability. Neonates positive for UTI were further investigated with ultrasound, cystourethrography, and acute phase renal scintigraphy with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinate acid (DMSA). Thirty neonates (6.5%) were found to have UTI. Twenty-eight of them had indirect hyperbilirubinemia and two had direct hyperbilirubinemia, with total bilirubin levels of 11.8-20.1 mg/dL. None of the neonates was found to have jaundice because of other reasons such as infection. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 5 neonates and one of them was combined with hydronephrosis.

RPI was evaluated by technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. If the first DMSA findings were abnormal, another analysis was performed 6 months later. The cutoff points for ESR, CRP, and PCT were established by comparing the areas under their receiver operating characteristic curves. Statistical analysis was performed using 1-way analysis of variance. Of the 57 children, 27 were diagnosed with RPI on the basis of positive DMSA results. The ESR, CRP, and PCT levels were significantly greater (P < .001) in the patients with RPI than in those without RPI. In contrast, the leukocyte count was the same in both groups (P > .05). PCT was a more sensitive and specific marker for differentiating upper and lower urinary tract infection than ESR and CRP. Persistent lesions at the site of previous RPI were found in 12 patients in the follow-up DMSA analysis, with total regression evident in the remaining 15. The PCT levels were significantly greater in those with persistent renal lesions than in those with total regression (P = .005). Serum PCT is a more reliable biologic marker than the ESR, CRP, or leukocyte count for the early prediction of RPI in children with a first episode of urinary tract infection. In addition, the greater the elevation of PCT at admission, the more positive the correlation for subsequent permanent renal damage."}

The kidneys and urinary tracts were mostly normal. The acute technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans showed pyelonephritis in 54% of cases. Renal scarring developed in 15% of cases. The ultrasonographic and cystographic findings were poor predictors of long-term damage, showing minor sonographic abnormalities for 12 and reflux for 23 of the 45 children who subsequently developed scarring. The benefit of performing ultrasonography and scintigraphy in the acute phase or cystourethrography is minimal. Our findings support (1) technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy 6 months after infection to detect scarring that may be related to long-term hypertension, proteinuria, and renal function impairment (although the degree of scarring was generally minor and did not impair renal function) and (2) continued surveillance to identify recurrent urinary tract infections that may warrant further investigation."}

To review the most relevant clinical studies that evaluate kidney damage in children with primary vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), we reviewed and compared randomized controlled trials and clinical trials from scientific literature. In these studies, vesico-ureteral reflux was diagnosed by voiding cystourethrogram and kidney damage was assessed by either DMSA scan or urography. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was calculated using Review Manager Software (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2000). The overall relative risk of kidney damage shown by DMSA scan and urography was statistically higher in children with vesico-ureteral reflux of various degrees than in controls (3.7 times and 2.8 times, respectively). However, in high-grade VUR, the relative risk of congenital kidney damage was 5.6 times that of controls. We conclude that severe VUR is frequently associated with early kidney damage, perhaps with prenatal onset. Progression of kidney damage may depend on the severity of VUR and untreated urinary tract infections. Prevention of congenital kidney damage from severe VUR is possible when there is early intervention, even during fetal growth."}

When possible data were analyzed according to patients and renal units. Among 23 references the overall rates of renal scarring in terms of patients and renal units were 41.6% and 37.0%, respectively. In terms of patients the incidence of renal scarring following acute pyelonephritis varied by region, from 26.5% (Australia) to 49.0% (Asia). In terms of renal units the incidence of acquired renal cortical scarring varied by region, from 16.7% (Middle East) to 58.4% (Asia). When combined by vesicoureteral reflux status children and renal units with refluxing ureters exhibited an increased risk of renal scarring (odds ratios 2.8 and 3.7, respectively). Although scarring was different across some regions, only scarring in Asian studies comparing patients displayed a statistically significant difference. A regional effect explained the heterogeneity observed in the overall estimate for patients and partly for renal units. The greatest risk of renal scarring may be imparted by the presence of vesicoureteral reflux."}

Acute pyelonephritis is a common infectious disease in children and can result in permanent renal damage. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important mediator of inflammation in response to bacterial infection. This study investigated the potential relationship between acute-phase IL-6 and subsequent renal scarring in children with a first time febrile acute pyelonephritis. In total, 79 children (age range 1-120 months) with a first time febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) were included. The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis was confirmed by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan. Serum and urine samples were collected for IL-6 measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before antibiotic treatment for the infection. The 79 children were divided into acute pyelonephritis (n=45) and lower UTI (n=34) groups according to the findings of DMSA scans. The initial serum and urine IL-6 levels of children with acute pyelonephritis were significantly higher compared with lower UTI (p < 0.001). Renal scarring was detected at the follow-up DMSA scans in 15 (34.1%) of the 44 children with acute pyelonephritis. Both serum and urine IL-6 levels during the acute phase of pyelonephritis were significantly higher in children with renal scarring than in those without (p=0.005 and p = 0.002). The median age of children with renal scarring was significantly lower than those without (p=0.034). Multiple regression analysis showed that higher initial serum and urine IL-6 levels and a younger age were associated with renal scarring. These results demonstrate that in younger children with a first time febrile acute pyelonephritis, elevations of the acute-phase serum and urine IL-6 levels were correlated with an increased risk of subsequent renal scarring."}

A total of 202 consecutive adult patients with APN were prospectively enrolled from September 2005 to June 2007. APN was defined as the concomitant presence of 4 major and >/=2 minor clinical or laboratory signs or symptoms suggestive of APN. All patients were treated with parenteral antibiotics. The patients were discharged after normalization of body temperature, serum white blood cell counts, and urinalysis. Correlations among the recurrence of APN and various factors, including CRP, were investigated. Of the 202 patients, 13 were excluded because of the presence of complicating factors or insufficient data. APN recurrence developed in 4 patients (2.1%). The CRP level at discharge correlated significantly with the recurrence of APN on univariate and multivariate analysis. Irrespective of the normalization of body temperature, serum white blood cell counts, and urinalysis, the recurrence of APN was significantly greater in the patients with CRP >4 mg/dL than in those with <4 mg/dL at discharge. Patients with a maximal CRP of >15 mg/dL during admission had a longer hospitalization and required more intravenous antibiotic therapy than did the patients with a maximal CRP of <15 mg/dL. As a marker of prolonged hospitalization and recurrence, CRP can complement the present clinical and laboratory parameters used as guides in the proper treatment of patients with uncomplicated APN."}

RPI was evaluated by Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy within 7 days of admission. To establish cut-off points for ESR, CRP, and PCT, we used receiver operating characteristics curves and compared the area under the curve for ESR, CRP, and PCT. Twenty-seven children were diagnosed as having RPI based on positive renal scintigraphy. A body temperature of >38 degrees C, a history of diarrhea, and poor oral intake were more common in patients with RPI. ESR, CRP, and PCT, but not leukocyte count, were significantly higher in patients with RPI (P < 0.001).

We investigated the incidence of recurrent UTI during the following year and the following risk factors: gender, young age, phimosis, vaginal reflux, and acute pyelonephritis (APN) diagnosed by 99m-technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA)(+) scintigraphy. The incidence of recurrent UTI was 21.1%. The difference in recurrence rate according to gender was not significant. The recurrence rate in infants less than 6 months of age was 25.8%, which was significantly higher than the 7.7% in older infants (P = 0.045). In male infants with persistent non-retractile prepuces, recurrent UTI developed in 34.0%, which was significantly higher than the 17.6% in male infants with retractile prepuces (P = 0.022). The presence of APN in male infants increased the likelihood of recurrent UTI when analyzed by multivariate logistic regression [odds ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.6-13.0, P = 0.003]. The presence of vaginal reflux and APN in female infants gave no significant difference to the incidence of recurrent UTI. In infants with normal urinary systems, age less than 6 months, non-retractile prepuces and APN in male infants, were the most important risk factors for recurrent UTIs. It is suggested that non-retractile prepuces should be adequately treated to become retractile in young male infants with APN."}

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine expressed at sites of inflammation. We have assessed this factor (MIF) in urinary tract infections with the aim of determining a non-invasive and sensitive method to differentiate upper and lower renal involvement. Thirty-three pediatric patients with urinary track infection (25 with acute pyelonephritis, eight with acute cystitis) and 40 healthy subjects were recruited for this prospective case-control study. Pyelonephritis was differentiated from cystitis by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Urinary MIF concentration was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The urine MIF/creatinine (Cr) ratio was significantly higher in pyelonephritis patients than in those with acute cystitis and the control group (P < 0.001). The optimal cut-point of 4.90 pg/micromol Cr for the urine MIF/Cr ratio has the potential to be a biomarker for distinguishing patients with acute pyelonephritis from those with acute cystitis. Determination of the urinary MIF was also useful in selecting the patients at risk of permanent renal damage. Of those patients with pyelonephritis, based on the DMSA scan at the time of infection, scarring on follow-up DMSA scan 9-12 months later occurred in patients with the highest urinary MIF/Cr ratios. We conclude that the urine MIF/Cr ratio is a sensitive test for differentiating acute pyelonephritis from acute cystitis and also for detecting children with acute pyelonephritis who are at a higher risk for permanent renal scars in the future."}

Escherichia coli is the most frequently identified microbiological agent in childhood urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, the pathogenic role of this organism in young children remains to be clearly elucidated. So far, no studies have been conducted in which multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been applied to determine the association between childhood UTIs and E. coli and urovirulent genes. Altogether, 330 suprapubic urine specimens from febrile young children were cultured. In 33 of the cases, E. coli was identified; among these cases, 18 had a UTI (>10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), four had a suspected UTI (>10(2)-10(3) cfu/ml) and 11 did not have UTIs (10(2) cfu/ml). Using multiplex PCR, three uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) genes and two enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) genes were detected. In the UTI-UPEC cases, the kps gene was detected in 18 of 22 cases (82%) and the usp gene in 16 of 22 cases (73%). Among the 18 cases of children with UTIs characterized by 10(4)-10(5) E. coli cfu/ml, urinary tract abnormalities were identified via dimercaptosuccinic acid scans in seven of 18 cases (39%) and via voiding cystourethrograms in four of the 18 cases (22%). The UPEC kps and usp genes were clearly associated with childhood UTIs, and may also be associated with kidney or urinary tract dysfunctions in young children. Escherichia coli colony count numbers in excess of 10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml in the suprapubic urine were considered to be strong evidence of UTI in infants."}

The dimercaptosuccinic acid radionuclide scan revealed no function in MCDK in all of our patients. Voiding cystourethrogram was performed in all patients. Twenty patients (22.2%) had abnormalities in the contralateral kidney. Nephrectomy was performed in 41 patients (45.5%). Twelve patients had undergone routine nephrectomy before 1996. Since then, patients have been followed up conservatively, and nephrectomy has been performed only when indicated. Indication of nephrectomy was arterial hypertension in 16 patients (23.1%), recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in 11 (15.9%), and severe abdominal pain in two (2.8%). Hypertension was noted within the first year of life in all patients except two. MCDK completely involuted in 39.3% within 48 months. There was no malignant transformation, proteinuria, or renal failure. In conclusion, hypertension is often noticed in infants with MCDK. Uninephrectomy leads to normalization.

Laboratory investigations including peripheral total and differential leukocyte counts, ESR, and CRP were assessed in relation to the inflammatory responses. Leukocyte count results were available in all of the patients, ESR in 41, and CRP in 36. Leukocyte count was normal in 6 patients (9.8%). Lymphocytic leukocytosis was seen in 1 patients (1.6%), neutrophilic leukocytosis in 25 (41.0%), and relative neutrophilia in 29 (47.5%). Thirty patients (73.2%) had a high ESR and 23 (63.9%) had a positive CRP. In children with a high ESR, 12 (29.3%) had neutrophilic leukocytosis and 14 (34.1%) had relative neutrophilia. Relative neutrophilia and neutrophilic leukocytosis with positive CRP both were found in 11 patients (30.6%). Negative CRP with absence of neutrophilic leukocytosis was found in a significantly higher proportion of patients. There were no direct correlations between the severity of systemic inflammatory responses and urinary tract inflammatory response. Findings of this study showed that ESR and differential leukocyte count are two valuable tests in febrile UTI and may be useful for localization of UTI level, but the total leukocyte count and CRP level as in qualitative methods are not useful, and many patients with febrile UTI do not have leukocytosis."}

The study cohort includes a total of 50 children in whom chikungunya was confirmed by molecular tools. Mean age was 9.3 years and the male-to-female sex ratio was 1:5. The main symptoms were intense pain (88%), high fever (82%), and skin rash (80%) that was less common in children under 2 years of age. Neurological complications were observed in 46% of patients including hypotonia (22%) that occurred mainly in newborns, meningitis syndrome (18%) and convulsions (16%) that occurred mainly in children over 2 years of age. Infectious complications included pneumonia (4%), pyelonephritis (2%), and possible nosocomial septicemia due to Pseudomonas (6%). The main hematological abnormalities were lymphopenia (27%) and thrombopenia (16%). Serum CRP values were moderately high (mean, 25 mg/l). Elevated AST (24%) and ALT (10%) values were observed. High CSF protein levels were noted in 30% of cases. A total of 25 children required hospitalization for more than 10 days. There were two deaths in newborns infected before the seventh day of life. The main risk factors for hospitalization longer than 10 days were premature birth and age at the time of chikungunya infection."}

Young children may develop renal scarring following a urinary tract infection (UTI) especially after pyelonephritis which is difficult to diagnose. Permanent renal scars are diagnosed by dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan several months later. To decrease unnecessary exposure to radiation, we investigate the role of renal power Doppler (RPD) in predicting those who may not require a late DMSA scan. Children under four years of age with a first UTI underwent an RPD study soon after diagnosis, and a DMSA scintigraphy six months later. The predictive values of the early RPD to detect DMSA renal scarring were calculated. Twenty three children (median age 30 months) were enrolled: 13 had a febrile presentation, two with bacteraemia. Permanent scarring occurred in three children (13%). In the 46 kidney units studied, initial RPD was abnormal in two and late DMSA abnormal in three units. Overall concordance between RPD and DMSA was 93.5%. The sensitivity of RPD for renal scar as per DMSA was 33.3%, specificity 97.7%; positive predictive value 50% and a negative predictive value of 95.4%. RPD offered no advantage over ultrasound to predict renal scarring and cannot be recommended to predict renal scarring following UTI."}

The relationships among urinary tract infection (UTI), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and permanent renal damage in children are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of renal scarring in children with a history of UTI and to determine the change in the probability of permanent renal damage owing to the presence of VUR documented on micturating cystourethrography (MCU). We analyzed 201 children (400 renal units, two children with solitary kidney). Seventy-four boys and 127 girls (aged 7 months to 7 years, median 2.5 years) with culture verified UTI were referred for technetium-labeled dimercaptosuccinic (DMSA) renal scintigraphy 4-6 months after acute UTI. MCU was also performed mostly 1 month prior to DMSA. Statistical analysis was performed using chi2 test or Fisher's exact test. Likelihood ratio (LR) positive and negative, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and post-test probability of (no) disease were calculated for VUR on MCU versus scarring on DMSA. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 158 (39.5%) kidneys, and evaluated as grades I, II, III, IV, and V in 3, 70, 43, 25, and 17 refluxing renal units (RRU), respectively. Permanent renal damage according to DMSA was seen in 15.2% (61/400) kidneys. Scarring was shown in 29.7% (47/158) of kidneys with VUR and in 5.8% (14/242) kidneys without VUR (P<0.0001). LR positive was 2.353 (95% CI 1.889, 2.865), LR negative 0.341 (95% CI 0.209, 0.523), and DOR 6.895 (95% CI 3.533, 14.093). Rate of scarring significantly increased with VUR of grades III, IV, and V. There was no significant difference in the incidence of scarring in kidneys without VUR and RRU with low-grade (I and II) VUR (P=0.306). The presence of VUR on MCU increased the chance of renal damage on DMSA by about 15%, whereas negative MCU increased the chance of no-renal involvement by 9%. Micturating cystourethrography should not be used as a first-line test to rule out the permanent renal damage owing to UTI. The priority of imaging strategy should be focused on early identification of renal lesions to prevent further deterioration."}

A multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial. Febrile urinary tract infections are common in children and associated with the risk for renal scarring and long-term complications. Antimicrobial prophylaxis has been used to reduce the risk for recurrence. We performed a study to determine whether no prophylaxis is similar to antimicrobial prophylaxis for 12 months in reducing the recurrence of febrile urinary tract infections in children after a first febrile urinary tract infection. The study was a controlled, randomized, open-label, 2-armed, noninferiority trial comparing no prophylaxis with prophylaxis (co-trimoxazole 15 mg/kg per day or co-amoxiclav 15 mg/kg per day) for 12 months. A total of 338 children who were aged 2 months to <7 years and had a first episode of febrile urinary tract infection were enrolled: 309 with a confirmed pyelonephritis on a technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan with or without reflux and 27 with a clinical pyelonephritis and reflux. The primary end point was recurrence rate of febrile urinary tract infections during 12 months. Secondary end point was the rate of renal scarring produced by recurrent urinary tract infections on technetium 99m dimercaptosuccinic acid scan after 12 months. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences in the primary outcome between no prophylaxis and prophylaxis: 12 (9.45%) of 127 vs 15 (7.11%) of 211. In the subgroup of children with reflux, the recurrence of febrile urinary tract infections was 9 (19.6%) of 46 on no prophylaxis and 10 (12.1%) of 82 on prophylaxis. No significant difference was found in the secondary outcome: 2 (1.9%) of 108 on no prophylaxis versus 2 (1.1%) of 187 on prophylaxis. Bivariate analysis and Cox proportional hazard model showed that grade III reflux was a risk factor for recurrent febrile urinary tract infections. Whereas increasing age was protective, use of no prophylaxis was not a risk factor. For children with or without primary nonsevere reflux, prophylaxis does not reduce the rate of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections after the first episode."}

A total of 50 children who had renal scarring on dimercapto-succinic acid scan 6 months after acute pyelonephritis underwent a repeat scan 3 years later. Lesion changes were evaluated by 3 blinded observers, and were classified as no change, partial resolution or complete disappearance. Renal size at time of acute pyelonephritis and after 3 years was obtained by ultrasound, and renal growth was assessed comparing z-score for age between the 2 measures. Robust linear regression was used to identify determinants of renal growth. At 6 months after acute pyelonephritis 88 scars were observed in 100 renal units. No change was observed in 27%, partial resolution in 63% and complete disappearance in 9% of lesions. Overall, 72% of lesions improved. Increased number of scars was associated with high grade vesicoureteral reflux (p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that the number of scars was the most important parameter leading to decreased renal growth (CI -1.05 to -0.35, p <0.001), and with 3 or more scars this finding was highly significant on univariate analysis (-1.59, CI -2.10 to -1.09, p <0.0001). Even 6 months after acute pyelonephritis 72% of dimercapto-succinic acid defects improved, demonstrating that some of the lesions may be not definitive.

Seronegative spondyloarthritis (SSA) is a type of arthritis that involves joints in the spine, as well as the hips, shoulders, knees and ankles. The diagnosis of juvenile spondyloarthritis is rarely entertained in young children who present with back and leg pain. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of HLA-B27 as a diagnostic marker in children with spondyloarthropathy, and correlation of HLA-B27 with radiological features and tuberculosis. Routine haematological and immunological tests were done by standard method and HLA-B27 typing was done by the lymphocytotoxicity method. A total of 70 cases of juvenile spondyloarthropathy were studied from May 2006 to September 2007. It included both males and females. Positivity of HLA-B27 in childhood SSA was only 71.4 percent (50/70). Gender-wise analysis showed that 76.7 percent (46/60) males and 20.0 percent (2/10) of the female patients were HLA-B27 positive. In HLA-B27-positive cases, the sacroiliac, hip, ankle, lower spine and knee joints were more involved. Urinary tract infection, diarrhoea and constipation were more common in HLA-B27-positive cases. None of the HLA-B27 cases were positive for rheumatoid factor; however, C-reactive protein was raised in 60.5 percent. In bilateral/unilateral sacroiliitis diagnosed by radiographs, only 81.5 percent patients were HLA-B27 positive. Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 14.3 percent (10/70) of total cases in which HLA-B27 positivity was seen in 60 percent of cases (6/10). Our study concludes that both HLA-B27 and radiological tests should be done in male children suspected to have SSA, because it can indicate early cases of juvenile spondyloarthropathy when radiological changes are not present, and it produces a more severe disease. HLA-B27 positivity probably also predisposes to tuberculosis."}

Urine culture is the basic investigation that allow to identify pathogen and its drug sensitiveness but simultaneous urinalysis is necessary to recognize the inflammation of urinary organs. In addition, the number of leukocytes gives an idea about inflammation intensity. Ultrasonographic (USG) scan is necessary to examine urostasis. DMSA study performed during febrile UTI allow to identify children with acute pyelonephritis and when repeated 6 months later - those with renal scars. A normal USG and DMSA scan during infection makes voiding cystourethrography (VCU) unnecessary in the primary examination. The presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) not always predispose children to renal lesions. Early and appropriate treatment of UTI, especially during the first 24 hours, diminishes the likelihood of renal involvement during the acute phase of infection but does not prevent scar formation. The proper hygiene of the urethral meatus, voiding and drinking habits and preventing of constipation are crucial in UTI prophylaxis."}

Children with very high procalcitonin levels during urinary tract infections are likely to be at risk of renal damage and vesico-ureteral reflux. Therefore, the prediction of long-term renal damage showed contradictory results. However, high procalcitonin values at diagnosis and positive scintigraphic scans may suggest the need to investigate for vesico-ureteral reflux. Consequently, procalcitonin levels should be included in follow-up protocols for urinary tract infections to aid in decision making concerning scintigraphic scans and voiding cystourethrograms."}

A prospective observational study was performed with febrile infants <or=90 days of age presenting to an urban, pediatric, emergency department. Serum procalcitonin levels were measured by using an automated high-sensitivity assay. An optimal procalcitonin cutoff value was selected to maximize sensitivity and negative predictive value for the detection of serious bacterial infections. Infants were classified as having definite, possible, or no serious bacterial infections. A total of 234 infants (median age: 51 days) were studied. Thirty infants (12.8%) had definite serious bacterial infections (bacteremia: n = 4; bacteremia with urinary tract infections: n = 2; urinary tract infections: n = 24), and 12 infants (5.1%) had possible serious bacterial infections (pneumonia: n = 5; urinary tract infections: n = 7). Mean procalcitonin levels for definite serious bacterial infections (2.21 +/- 3.9 ng/mL) and definite plus possible serious bacterial infections (2.48 +/- 4.6 ng/mL) were significantly higher than that for no serious bacterial infection (0.38 +/- 1.0 ng/mL). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.82 for definite serious bacterial infections and 0.76 for definite and possible serious bacterial infections. For identifying definite and possible serious bacterial infections, a cutoff value of 0.12 ng/mL had sensitivity of 95.2%, specificity of 25.5%, negative predictive value of 96.1%, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.19; all cases of bacteremia were identified accurately with this cutoff value.

Positive linear association was noted between reflux grade and acute photon defect by linear association test (p = 0.002). No association was found between reflux grade and scar formation (p = 0.262). Although vesicoureteral reflux is not a prerequisite for development of acute photon defect and subsequent renal scarring, reflux itself might be an aggravating factor for acute photon defect and scar formation. There seems to be a correlation between reflux grade and frequency of acute photon defect on dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy but scar change occurs independently of reflux grade."}

Because the risk was not well defined, we investigated renal scarring associated with delayed versus early treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. The research findings are derived from 2 multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled studies, Italian Renal Infection Study 1 and 2, whose primary outcomes dealt with initial antibiotic treatment and subsequent prophylaxis, respectively. From the 2 studies, we selected the 287 children with confirmed pyelonephritis on acute technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans who underwent repeat scanning to detect scarring 12 months later. The children were 1 month to <7 years of age when they presented with their first recognized episode of acute pyelonephritis in northeast Italy.

Definitive treatment of ectopic ureterocele (EU) implies that no further surgery or prophylactic antibiotic is needed. The literature is unclear on which interventions render a child 'treatment free'. Thirty (23 female, seven male) patients presented between 1984 and 2000. Follow up ranged from 5 to 15 years (mean: 7). Presenting reasons were: urinary tract infection in 18 (16 females, two males; age: 17<6 months, one 2 years), prenatal ultrasound in 11 (seven females, four males), and renal failure in one (male, aged 3 weeks). Treatment was as follows. No intervention, three (10%). Single procedure, eight (27%): five hemi-nephrectomy (HN), two transurethral incisions (TUI), one excision and re-implantation (E&R). Two procedures, 14 (47%): first procedure 10 TUI, 4 HN; second procedure 13 E&R, 1 TUI. Three procedures, three (10%): first 2 TUI, 1 HN; second 3 TUI; third 2 E&R, 1 HN. Four procedures, two (7%): first 2 TUI; second 1 HN, 1 TUI; third 2 TUI; fourth 2 E&R. Eight (27%) remained on prophylaxis: two had no intervention, in 4 the ectopic ureterocele was in situ after HN or TUI, and two had reflux after E&R. Twenty two (73%) came off prophylaxis (16 E&R, 4 HN, 1 TUI, 1 observation). Poorly or non-functioning upper pole moieties were left in place in 14/18 who underwent E&R. 'Treatment-free' status most often requires ureterocele excision. HN alone can be definitive, while TUI alone is so rarely. Poor or non-functioning upper pole segments can remain after E&R. Children with collapsed ureteroceles in situ often must remain on antibiotic prophylaxis. A staged approach with initial TUI, followed by E&R, was successful in definitively treating the majority."}

Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of the pediatric genitourinary tract. The purpose of this review is to familiarize the reader with the basic techniques, strengths and limitations, as well as the current and potential future applications of MRU in pediatric urology. MRU can provide detailed anatomical information and assess renal function and drainage in a single study. MRU does not employ ionizing radiation and may be utilized in patients with iodine-based contrast allergy or impaired renal function. MRU has been most often applied to the evaluation of hydronephrosis and provides valuable insight into a wide range of obstructive uropathies. MRU was shown to be superior to renal scintigraphy for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. The use of MRU for the assessment of urolithiasis and vesicoureteral reflux is limited and technical refinements are required. Potential future applications include fetal MRU, virtual endoscopy, and MRU-guided procedures. The development of new contrast agents and new image-processing software will further enhance the diagnostic potential of MRU in pediatric urology. MRU is currently thought of as a problem-solving tool to define anatomy and function when conventional methods fall short. This technique is likely to emerge as the imaging modality of choice for children with complex genitourinary pathology."}

We evaluated the predictors of renal scar in children with urinary tract infections (UTIs) having primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Data of patients who were examined by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy between 1995 and 2005 were evaluated retrospectively. Gender, age, reflux grade, presence/development of scarring, breakthrough UTIs, and resolution of reflux, were recorded. The relation of gender, age and VUR grade to preformed scarring and the relation of gender, age, VUR grade, presence of preformed scarring, number of breakthrough UTIs and reflux resolution to new scarring were assessed. There were 138 patients [male/female (M/F) 53/85]. Multivariate analysis showed that male gender [odds ratio (OR) 2.5], age > or = 27 months in girls (OR 4.2) and grades IV-V reflux (OR 12.4) were independent indicators of renal scarring. On the other hand, only the presence of previous renal scarring was found to be an independent indicator for the development of new renal scar (OR 13.4). In conclusion, while the most predictive variables for the presence of renal scarring among children presenting with a UTI were male gender, age > or = 27 months in girls, and grades IV-V reflux, the best predictor of new scar formation was presence of previous renal scarring."}

Surgical correction of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and prolonged administration of antibiotics seem to lead to similar renal outcomes. However, it is not known whether prenatal recognition and the position of VUR modify the outcome in different ways. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of prenatal detection and different treatment methods on the outcome of unilateral refluxing renal units. This retrospective study enrolled 119 children (mean age 2.8+/-3.5 years) with primary VUR. Kidney growth and renal function were measured with ultrasound and scintigraphy, respectively. To compare the ultrasound readings among patients of different ages the comparative-length index or index was calculated, as a percentage of the ratio of unilateral and the sum of bilateral renal length. In unilateral refluxing renal units there was a reduction in both index and function, whereas not-refluxing was increased. In the follow-up, unilateral refluxing renal units had a worse index, whereas not-refluxing was better. Unexpectedly, surgical therapy of the left-refluxing renal unit led to a reduction in the index, whereas its function always stayed low in diagnosis but stable. The outcome of severely refluxing renal units was similar after both interventions. Prenatal and postnatal diagnosis did not seem to modify the renal result. Surgery showed similar renal outcomes to medical treatment. A kidney growth defect from high-grade VUR was detected in the diagnosis. Therefore, a congenitally damaged kidney does not ameliorate after each treatment. Finally, prenatal detection of VUR does not seem to modify the outcome of the kidney significantly."}

Therefore, both tests may not always be necessary. To determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between DRF values calculated using 99mTc-DMSA and those calculated using 99mTc-MAG3. We retrospectively identified children imaged with 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MAG3. We recorded DRF values, age, indication, and renal pelvis diameter. For the 99mTc-DMSA studies we recorded the imaging time after injection. For the 99mTc-MAG3 studies we recorded the delay between injection and data acquisition, diuretic use and evidence of delayed drainage or reflux. We identified 100 episodes in 92 children where both 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MAG3 scans had been performed within a few days. The commonest indication was urinary tract infection or pelviureteric junction obstruction. The mean age of the children was 6.96 years. A significant but clinically acceptable trend was seen between abnormal DRF and difference between tests. A significant link was found with the difference between tests and the time of imaging after DMSA injection, and also with scarring. No significant effect was caused by renal pelvis dilatation, delayed drainage, frusemide administration, or delayed 99mTc-MAG3 imaging. If a 99mTc-MAG3 study has been performed then a 99mTc-DMSA study is unnecessary provided DRF is normal on the 99mTc-MAG3 study and there is no scarring. A change in practice would lead to considerable savings in time, cost and radiation burden."}

Prospective case control study. Measurements were made of PCT (METHOD: Essay immunoluminometric--and ultrasensitive--BRAHMS Diagnostika, Berlin, Germany), C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood and urine cultures. The index of activity of SLE was determined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score of a serial group of patients seen by our rheumatology service. Samples from 53 patients were analyzed. The patients were divided in 2 groups: group I (n = 21) with little or no activity for SLE; group II (n = 32) with activity for SLE (SLEDAI >5). None of the patients had severe bacterial infection, sepsis, or systemic multiorgan failure. Group I had a SLEDAI score of 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.51] with mean levels of PCT 0. 08 ng/mL (Negative smaller than 0. 5 ng/mL). Group II SLEDAI score was 14.6 (95% CI 11.95-17.23) with mean levels of PCT 0.418 ng/mL with standard deviation 1.0021 (95% CI 0.0628-0.773). The measure of association calculated by Fisher method was not significant (1.927) (P = 0. 282). In the group II, 3 patients had frankly positive PCT (3.18, 3.42, and 3.95 ng/mL) and high activity indices (14, 13, and 24). None presented with severe infection, sepsis, or systemic multiorgan failure. They had pneumonia, renal failure (PCT 3.42 ng/mL) and urinary tract infection without systemic symptoms (3.95 ng/mL). Infection was not detected in the other patient (3.18 ng/mL) that was interpreted as a false positive. This study demonstrates that there is no association between the activity of SLE and PCT levels. The utility of the PCT resides is in raising suspicion of a concurrent bacterial or mycotic infection in the evaluation of patients with active autoimmune diseases."}

Although vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a very frequent pathology in the pediatric age and represents an important part of the activity of pediatricians, pediatric urologists, nephrologists, and radiologists, yet there is controversy about its global management both in diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this paper is to perform an update in the use of different imaging techniques in the diagnosis and followup of VUR and to propose a work up protocol. We describe the imaging techniques: VCUG, ultrasound, intravenous urography, bladder-ultrasound, DMSA, MRI, and their role in the evaluation and followup of VUR. We performed a bibliographic review about the topic and present the experience of our working group on VUR. The bibliographic review shows a clear evolution of the concepts of VUR and also the management algorithms. The concepts of congenital renal lesion without urinary tract infection (UTI) or acquired lesion after UTI are clearly differentiated in the most recent reviews. Reflux is passing from being the center of the problem to a secondary phenomenon in relation to UTI, and this is leading to a change of diagnostic strategy, less and less invasive. VCUG has been to date the first and indisputable technique for the management of VUR, mainly in the diagnostic phase, but technological advances in the area of ultrasound (ultrasound contrasts, harmonic image, etc.) have converted ultrasound in the first imaging technique for the management of VUR in pediatric age. On the other hand, work-up algorithms have changed due to the great impact prenatal diagnosis is having in the management of urinary tract anomalies."}

In this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, we tested the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrence of pyelonephritis and avoiding new scars in a sample of children who were younger than 30 months and vesicoureteral reflux. One hundred patients with vesicoureteral reflux (grade II, III, or IV) diagnosed with cystourethrography after a first episode of acute pyelonephritis were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim or not for 2 years. The main outcome of the study was the recurrence of pyelonephritis during a follow-up period of 4 years. During follow-up, the patients were evaluated through repeated cystourethrographies, renal ultrasounds, and dimercaptosuccinic acid scans. The baseline characteristics in the 2 study groups were similar. There were no differences in the risk for having at least 1 pyelonephritis episode between the intervention and control groups. At the end of follow-up, the presence of renal scars was the same in children with and without antibiotic prophylaxis. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis was ineffective in reducing the rate of pyelonephritis recurrence and the incidence of renal damage in children who were younger than 30 months and had vesicoureteral reflux grades II through IV."}

We studied the value of CRP compared to total leukocytes (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in differentiating positive, contaminated and negative blood cultures in various pediatric infectious diseases (pneumonia, acute gastroenteritis (AGE), urinary tract infection (UTI) and acute otitis media (AOM)). Data was collected retrospectively from patients who were admitted or discharged from to the pediatric ward with one of the above diagnoses. Children with chronic diseases or with immunodeficiency were excluded from the study. CRP levels were significantly higher in the positive culture group versus contaminated and negative groups (101 mg/L, 30.9 mg/L, 34.3 mg/L, respectively). The total leukocytes and ANC were not of value. When divided into diagnostic subgroups, CRP levels were significantly higher in the positive blood culture groups in patients with pneumonia and AGE. The sensitivity of a CRP value above 85 mg/L for pneumonia and UTI and above 30 mg/L for AGE and AOM in discriminating true positive versus contaminated culture was 70% with a specificity of 67.6% and a positive predictive value of 60.3%.

After initial treatment with intravenous netilmicin and ceftriaxone, patients were randomly assigned to either 5 days of oral antibiotics (short intravenous treatment) or 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone (long intravenous treatment). Inclusion criteria were age 3 months to 16 years and first acute pyelonephritis episode, defined by fever of >38.5 degrees C, C-reactive protein level of >20 mg/L, and bacteriuria at >10(5)/mL. All patients underwent 99m technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy 6 to 9 months after inclusion. A total of 548 children were included, 48 of whom were secondarily excluded and 117 of whom were lost to follow-up or had incomplete data; therefore, 383 children were eligible, 205 of them in the short intravenous treatment group and 178 in the long intravenous treatment group. At inclusion, median age was 15 months, median duration of fever was 43 hours, and median C-reactive protein level was 122 mg/L. A total of 37% (143 of 383) of patients had a vesicoureteral reflux grades 1 to 3. Patient characteristics at inclusion were similar in both groups, except for a significantly higher proportion of girls in the short intravenous treatment group. The frequency of renal scars at scintigraphy was similar in both groups. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that renal scars were significantly associated with increased renal height at initial ultrasound and with the presence of grade 3 vesicoureteric reflux. The incidence of renal scars was similar in patients who received 3 days compared 8 days of intravenous ceftriaxone. Increased renal height at initial ultrasound examination and grade 3 vesicoureteric reflux were significant risk factors for renal scars."}

Renal parenchymal involvement was confirmed by imaging in 16 cases (69.6%). The imaging spectrum ranged from a small single lesion to large multiple defects; on admission, 2 cases had no pain and 2 had no fever; lower urinary tract symptoms were present in only 13 patients (7 with parenchymal involvement). All patients with parenchymal involvement had at least one sign of systemic inflammation-infection. Most patients (15) had taken antibiotics before hospitalisation; consequently, urine cultures were negative in 21 cases (14 cases with positive imaging (87.5%)).

From strategies based on extensive investigations in all children younger than 7 years of age, we are slowly moving to imaging strategies focused on children at risk of developing renal damage and possibly long-term complications. The article provides an overview on urinary tract infections, their complications and the use of imaging in their management. The different imaging strategies in children with UTIs (including the recommendation of excluding from imaging certain groups of patients) still needs full evaluation. It is interesting to note, however, a slow move from wide use of cystography in all children with UTI, which has been standard practice for many years but was probably not based on solid scientific evidence, toward a more focused use of cystograms in specific groups of children."}

A randomised multi-centre trial was conducted in 365 children aged 6 months to 16 years with bacterial growth in cultures from urine collected by catheter. The children were assigned to receive either oral ceftibuten (9 mg/kg once daily) for 14 days or intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) for 3 days followed by oral ceftibuten for 11 days. Only patients with lesions detected on acute-phase dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy underwent follow-up scintigraphy. Efficacy was evaluated by the rate of renal scarring after 6 months on follow-up scintigraphy. Of 219 children with lesions on acute-phase scintigraphy, 152 completed the study; 80 (72 females, median age 2.2 years) were given ceftibuten and 72 (62 females, median age 1.6 years) were given ceftriaxone/ceftibuten. Patients in the intravenous/oral group had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at baseline and larger lesion(s) on acute-phase scintigraphy. Follow-up scintigraphy showed renal scarring in 21/80 children treated with ceftibuten and 33/72 with ceftriaxone/ceftibuten (p = 0.01). However, after adjustment for the confounding variables (CRP and size of acute-phase lesion), no significant difference was observed for renal scarring between the two groups (p = 0.2). Renal scarring correlated with the extent of the acute-phase lesion (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and the grade of vesico-ureteric reflux (r = 0.31, p = 0.03), and was more frequent in refluxing renal units (p = 0.04). The majority of patients, i.e. 44 in the oral group and 47 in the intravenous/oral group, were managed as out-patients. Side effects were not observed. From this study, we can conclude that once-daily oral ceftibuten for 14 days yielded comparable results to sequential ceftriaxone/ceftibuten treatment in children aged 6 months to 16 years with DMSA-documented acute pyelonephritis and it allowed out-patient management in the majority of these children."}

Pyelonephritis and renal scarring can be distinguished by assessing the parenchymal contours and signal intensity. Characteristic imaging features of renal dysplasia include small size, subcortical cysts, disorganized architecture, decreased and patchy contrast enhancement as well as a dysmorphic pelvicalyceal system. Because of its ability to subdivide and categorize this heterogeneous group of disorders, it seems inevitable that MR urography will replace DMSA renal scintigraphy as the gold standard for assessment of pyelonephritis and renal scarring.

However, the prognosis for childhood UTI remains good, with low long-term risks, from epidemiological studies, of developing these sequelae. Although childhood UTI is common, the occurrence of CKD and the likelihood that acute pyelonephritis will cause renal damage progressing to CKD are rare. We studied the current literature on investigations of childhood UTI and propose a protocol for carrying out selected investigations in high-risk children. By identifying this group of children with increased risk of having an abnormal urinary tract that warrant investigation, we recommend that targeting investigations to specific children (as opposed to protocol-based investigations of all children with UTI), will be clinically safe and effective and will avoid the unnecessary distress and cost of invasive investigations."}

An estimated 7% of girls and 2% of boys will have a urinary tract infection before 6 years of age, and between 20 and 40% of these children are diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux. Reflux is a risk factor for recurrent infections and renal scarring, which can lead to hypertension and kidney failure. Pediatric guidelines recommend routine voiding cystourethrography, but this is a painful and expensive examination that exposes children to radiation. Reliable non invasive markers of reflux would therefore be extremely useful. Ultrasonography and clinical decision rules have poor sensitivity for vesicoureteral reflux. In contrast, the level of procalcitonin, a marker of the severity of bacterial infections, is a good predictor of cystographic findings in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. Indeed, a procalcitonin level below 0.5 ng/ml predicted the absence of radiological reflux with a sensitivity of more than 75% in the French princeps study. This was validated by a prospective European study, in which sensitivity reached 100% for high-grade reflux. Procalcitonin assay can thus avoid voiding cystourethrography in 40 to 50% of young children with febrile urinary tract infections."}

Reflux nephropathy is an acquired focal renal scarring due to the combination of vesicoureteral (VUR) and intrarenal reflux (IRR) associated with urinary tract infections (IUT) and/or permanently high intravesical pressure. Up to 30-60% of children with VUR and a history of symptomatic IUT have renal scarring at the time of their initial studies. The onset of renal scarring usually occurs early in life, usually before age five years and most frequently before three years of age. Girls are at greater risk for developing reflux nephropathy, because of increased incidence of IUT. Reflux nephropathy is different from a diffuse congenital renal scarring (hypo-dysplasia), which is usually discovered antenatally or during infancy in boys with severe VUR. Without serial follow-up (ultrasonography, intravenous pyelourography, 99mTc-DMSA scan) from birth, it is not always possible to differentiate congenital renal scarring from reflux nephropathy. In contrast to reflux nephropathy, congenital renal scarring cannot be prevented. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is the gold standard technique (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) for the diagnosis of reflux nephropathy, but ultrasound is a good modality to monitor kidney growth over time. Reflux nephropathy and hypodysplasia are the main causes of chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension in children and adolescents in our country. The long-term follow-up of children with reflux nephropathy is mandatory, since its complications may take 10 to 20 years to develop. Uncontrollable arterial hypertension and proteinuria are the predictors of poor prognosis. The selective use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers is the efficient antihypertensive therapy, which also modify intrarenal haemodynamics and can preserve renal function."}

To highlight recent controversies regarding the rationale and effectiveness of imaging and treatment strategies for children who experience a first urinary tract infection. The yield of renal ultrasound for children who have had a first urinary tract infection is relatively low, and the most commonly identified abnormalities are of unclear clinical significance. If concerned about renal ultrasound abnormalities, clinicians should not be reassured by a normal late trimester prenatal ultrasound because its negative predictive value is not sufficiently high. Vesicoureteral reflux is neither necessary nor sufficient for developing renal scars. Some pyelonephritis and renal scarring may be related to vesicoureteral reflux that is missed by standard voiding cystourethrogram but detectable during positional instillation of contrast cystography. Dimercaptosuccinic acid scans provide important information about presence of pyelonephritis and renal scars, and have high negative predictive value for ruling out high-grade (III-V) vesicoureteral reflux. Antimicrobial prophylaxis may not be effective for preventing recurrent infections and may result in antimicrobial resistance. Endoscopic therapy (Deflux) has demonstrated moderate success in correcting vesicoureteral reflux, but little is known about its impact on recurrent infection and renal scarring. Debate continues about optimal imaging strategies after first urinary tract infection.

The objective of this study was to analyse the postoperative results of conservative management of functional ectopic ureter on duplicated collecting system by low uretero-ureterostomy in children. The medical records of children with duplicated collecting system and a functional ectopic ureter admitted to our department between 2001 and 2005 were reviewed. A postnatal radiological assessment comprising urinary tract ultrasound, retrograde cystography, intravenous urography and DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed. In each patient, the operative technique consisted of low uretero-ureterostomy with end-to-side uretero-ureteric anastomosis. This series comprised 3 girls and 2 boys. The ectopic ureter was located on the left side in all patients. Postnatal ultrasound confirmed the presence of dilatation of the upper collecting system and the retrovesical ureter estimated at 10 +/- 2 mm in 3 cases; in one case, dilatation of the upper collecting system was estimated at 25 mm and the retrovesical ureter was estimated at 16 +/- 2 mm; in the last patient, dilatation of the upper collecting system above the retrovesical ureter was estimated at 6.5 mm. Mean renal function of the upper pole (DMSA) was 23 +/- 7%. The mean age at the time of the operation was 8 months. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. Mean follow-up was 38 months (range: 18 months to 4.5 years). All children were asymptomatic and a reduction of collecting system and ureteric dilatation was confirmed on follow-up ultrasound at 10 months in all patients. Low uretero-ureteric anastomosis is an alternative to high collecting system anastomosis or ureteric reimplantation in the presence of a functional ectopic ureter on duplicated collecting system in children."}

Other acute abdominal diseases in children can confound the signs and symptoms of appendicitis, resulting in misdiagnosis and unnecessary appendectomy. In this study, we used discriminant analysis of serum inflammatory biomarkers to determine which acute abdominal diseases could mimic appendicitis, and further analyzed these diseases based on different age groups. We prospectively collected 417 patients aged from 4 to 18 years with clinically suspected acute appendicitis in the pediatric emergency department. We selected the significantly higher serum biomarkers for appendicitis as the discriminating variables. Furthermore, we analyzed the definitive diagnoses of patients with normal appendices who could not be predicted by discriminant analysis. Patients with acute appendicitis had significantly higher leukocyte counts (p < 0.01), neutrophil counts, (p < 0.01) and C-reactive protein concentrations (p < 0.01 ) than those with normal appendices. The discriminant power of these three serum biomarkers in acute appendicitis was 76 percent. Acute abdominal diseases which mimicked appendicitis included acute gastroenteritis, nonspecific abdominal pain, urinary tract infection, and upper respiratory infection with gastrointestinal upset. Serum biomarkers may serve as helpful discriminators to predict the presence of pediatric appendicitis. But, some acute abdominal diseases mimicking appendicitis should be considered during differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis to avoid making misdiagnosis and performing unnecessary appendectomy."}

Pyogenic sacroiliitis is a rare cause of hip pain and fever. We aim to report a series of 33 patients with pyogenic sacroiliitis and to investigate the differences among paediatric and adult cases. Clinical and laboratory data of 33 cases who were admitted to the emergency department with a confirmed discharge diagnosis of pyogenic sacroiliitis between 1996 and 2005 were assessed. All patients were divided into paediatric and adult groups by the age of 15 yr. The features of pyogenic sacroiliitis and clinical outcome were compared among the two groups. Several factors were analysed including gender, age, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, radiological examinations and scintigraphy. Among the all included patients, females were attacked more frequently than males (3: 1). One-third of patients had concurrent infections, of which urinary tract infections were the most common (41.6%). Compared with adult patients, paediatric patients tend to have fewer comorbid immunocompromized conditions, fewer concurrent infections, more equality in gender distribution and more presentations of weight bearing difficulty. Staphylococcus aureus was the main blood culture isolate from paediatric patients (80%), but only accounted for half of those from adult patients. Group B streptococcus and Salmonella spp. were not uncommon in the adult patients. Scintigraphic bone scan has the highest sensitivity (93.3%) and remains the image modality of choice. When local abscess formation is suspected, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be the preferred method used for examination. This case series should alert the physicians to the possibility of pyogenic sacroiliitis and the difference between paediatric and adult patients."}

Therapeutic delay has been suggested as the most important factor that is likely to have an effect on the development of scarring after acute pyelonephritis. However, this opinion has not been supported by prospective studies, so we tested it. In a prospective clinical study, we evaluated whether the time interval between the onset of the renal infection and the start of therapy correlates with the development of acute inflammatory changes and the subsequent development of renal scars, documented by dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. A total of 278 infants (153 male and 125 female) aged 0.5 to 12.0 months with their first urinary tract infection were enrolled in the study. The median time between the onset of infection and the institution of therapy was 2 days (range: 1-8 days). Renal inflammatory changes were documented in 57% of the infants. Renal defects were recorded in 41% of the patients treated within the first 24 hours since the onset of fever versus 75% of those treated on day 4 and onward. Renal scarring was developed in 51% of the infants with an abnormal scan in the acute phase of infection. The frequency of scarring in infants treated early and in those whose treatment was delayed did not differ, suggesting that once acute pyelonephritis has occurred, ultimate renal scarring is independent of the timing of therapy. Acute inflammatory changes and subsequent scarring were more frequent in the presence of vesicoureteral reflux, especially that which is high grade. However, the difference was not significant, which suggests that renal damage may be independent of the presence of reflux. Early and appropriate treatment of urinary tract infection, especially during the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, diminishes the likelihood of renal involvement during the acute phase of the infection but does not prevent scar formation."}

Renal scarring was diagnosed by (99m)technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (DMSA). Renal scarring was detected in 38 patients (31%). VUR, UTI, decreased bladder capacity, urinary residue, and trabeculated and thick bladder wall were associated with scarring at univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed VUR (P < 0.0001) as the independent risk factor for renal scarring. Thickness of the bladder wall was a marginal risk factor (P = 0.07). Although UTI was not a risk factor, it was associated with VUR (P = 0.03). In our analysis, VUR was the main risk factor; however, renal scarring was probably due to multifactorial causes, as VUR was associated with UTI."}

Prevention of renal scarring is the main therapeutic goal in children with spina bifida. We aimed to determine factors affecting renal scar development in these patients. Records of 312 children admitted between 1994 and 2005 with spina bifida were reviewed. Age on admission, gender, presence of previous febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and initial urodynamic findings were noted. Patients were grouped regarding presence/absence of renal scars on DMSA scans. Chi2 and Student's t tests were used for statistical evaluation. Seventy-two patients had renal scars on admission. Mean age was 4.62 +/- 4.59 years for patients without renal scars and 6.35 +/- 4.9 years for patients with scars. Male/female ratio was 1:1 in the scarless group and 1:2 in the group with scars. Previous febrile UTI was present in 11 of 240 scarless patients in contrast to 7 out of 72 patients in the scar group (p > 0.05). VUR was present in only 16.3% of cases without scars, whereas 36.1% of patients in the scar group had VUR. Detrusor overactivity and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia were observed in 67.1% of scarred patients, whereas this figure was 42.4% in the scarless group. The comparison of age on admission, gender, detrusor overactivity, and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia revealed significant differences between patients with and without renal scars. Late referral, female gender, overactive detrusor, and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia have detrimental effects on renal parenchymal function in spina bifida patients.

Sixteen patients were eligible for the study, including 9 with TT and 7 with orchitis/EO. Two infants had postnatal torsion, and the testicles were salvaged by emergent surgery. Eighty-six percent (6/7) of infants with EO/orchitis had either abnormal physical signs (fever or scrotal tenderness) or abnormal laboratory findings (leukocytosis or elevated C-reactive protein level). The sensitivity of color Doppler ultrasound to diagnose TT and EO/orchitis was 88% (7/8) and 100% (6/6), respectively. All infants (6/6) with EO/orchitis who were checked for urinary tract infection and sepsis had positive test results. Pediatricians should examine the testicles meticulously after a baby is born.

Children with DMSA proven pyelonephritis (n = 28) were grouped as either scar [+] (n = 19, unilateral renal scarring) or scar [-] (no scarring, n = 9). The scar [+] group was further divided into scar-1 (differential DMSA uptake, Delta(DMSA) </= 10%; n = 8) and scar-2 (Delta(DMSA) > 10%, n = 11) subgroups. S(CysC), serum creatinine, urine NAG, microalbumin, protein, fractional sodium excretion (FE(Na)), tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR), and U(CysC/Cr) were evaluated in all patients. Neither S(CysC) nor U(CysC) were affected by age, height, and weight. scar [+] versus scar [-] groups and scar-1 versus scar-2 subgroups were not different with regard to all studied parameters. S(CysC) did not increase in children with post-pyelonephritic unilateral renal scarring. However, 11 children with slightly increased (>0.95 mg/l) S(CysC) levels in scar [+] group tended to have higher Delta(DMSA), albeit not significantly. Furthermore, U(CysC/Cr) correlated well with urine microalbumin, NAG, and FE(Na) in all children and the scar [+] group (P < 0.05).

Acute pyelonephritis is a common infectious disease in children and can result in permanent renal damage. Interleukin (IL)-1beta is an important inflammatory mediator that appears early during bacterial infection. This prospective study examined urine IL-1beta levels in children with acute pyelonephritis documented by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan, and also evaluated whether this cytokine correlated with renal scarring. A total of 75 children aged 1-121 months with a diagnosis of first-time febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) were studied. The following inflammatory markers were assessed: fever, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, C-reactive protein (CRP) and urine IL-1beta. Urine samples were collected for IL-1beta measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after antibiotic treatment of the infection. Follow-up DMSA scan was performed at 6-12 months after the acute pyelonephritis to detect renal scarring. Twenty children with other febrile illnesses served as non-renal febrile controls. The 75 children were divided into acute pyelonephritis (n = 41) and lower UTI (n = 34) groups according to the findings of DMSA scans. Fever, WBC count, neutrophil count and CRP were significantly higher in the children with acute pyelonephritis than in those with lower UTI (all P < 0.001). The initial urine IL-1beta levels of children with acute pyelonephritis were significantly higher when compared with lower UTI and non-renal febrile controls (P < 0.001). Urine IL-1beta in children with acute pyelonephritis was positively correlated with fever, CRP, WBC, neutrophil and leucocyturia. Renal scarring was found in 12 (29.3%) of the 41 children with acute pyelonephritis. The mean age was significantly lower in the children with renal scarring compared with those without (P < 0.05). These results have shown that urine IL-1beta level may serve as a useful marker for the early detection of acute pyelonephritis in febrile children. Young children are at a risk of the development of renal scarring following acute pyelonephritis."}

The significance of late urinary tract infections (UTIs) after renal transplantation and their association with scarring and graft dysfunction remains controversial. We sought to define the prevalence of renal scarring in allograft recipients with a history of late recurrent UTIs, to determine whether the presence of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) confers an increased risk of scarring and to establish whether scarring correlates with graft dysfunction. Among 307 renal allograft recipients, we identified 56 (18%) with late recurrent UTIs (> or =3/year). A total of 32 patients had undergone further investigation by both 2,3 dimercapto-succinic acid single-photon emission computed tomography (99mTc-DMSA SPECT) scan and micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG). Of the 32 patients, 24 (75%) had scars on 99mTc-DMSA SPECT and 15 (47%) had reflux on MCUG. Thirteen of these 15 patients with reflux (87%) had scars, although there was no significant correlation between number of scars and degree of reflux. Eleven of 17 patients (65%) with UTIs but without VUR had scars, as did 12 of 14 (86%) with previous graft pyelonephritis. The pattern of scarring (typically multiple focal cortical defects) suggested infection as the cause. This pattern was not seen in a contemporary cohort with vascular occlusions and was rarely seen in patients with chronic allograft nephropathy. Scarring was not associated with inferior graft survival (median follow-up, 15 years). In patients with late UTIs, renal scarring is a frequent finding. Scarring may occur even in asymptomatic patients without VUR. The lack of an effect on graft survival may reflect successful intervention with prophylactic antibiotics and surveillance urine cultures. Late recurrent UTIs may be damaging to renal allografts, even in the absence of reflux."}

The AIM of this study was to evaluate the MAG3 scintigraphic presentation in the acute phase of pyelonephritis in children and re-evaluate them at least 6 months later, as well as to establish whether a MAG3 in the parenchymal phase is as reliable and sensitive in the detection of a renal parenchymal damage as the DMSA. The MAG3 scintigraphic pattern was evaluated during the first episode of acute pyelonephritis in 31 children (median age: 2.5 years) and compared to the DMSA scan. The scintigraphy was performed on the same day with both radiopharmaceuticals. After at least 6 months the whole procedure was repeated on 28 patients. A scoring system was designed to evaluate the parenchymal lesions, and categorize them as positive or equivocal. The findings on the initial scans were compared to those obtained in the follow up studies. When all lesions (equivocal + positive) were analysed, MAG3 sensitivity was 98%, and specificity 78%, while for positive lesions only, the values were 83 and 100%, respectively. The average acute severity score was significantly lower for both MAG3 and DMSA then the follow up score (p < 0.0001). These results corresponded to a clinical convalescence, which was observed in 26/28 children in the follow up. With the MAG3 scintigraphy a reliable semi quantitative and qualitative detection of the renal inflammatory lesions can be obtained in acute pyelonephritis, as well as their recovery, thus obviating the need for a DMSA scan. Moreover, the duration of the MAG3 procedure is shorter, enabling the visualization of the entire collecting system as well, while the radiation exposure is approximately a half of that delivered by the DMSA scan."}

The initial identified VUR versus renal scarring on follow-up DMSA showed little correlation. There is limited effectiveness of routine investigation by VCUG in infants with first confirmed UTI. VCUG may be withheld in a child who presents with first UTI before the age of one year if there has been no demonstrable abnormal DMSA scan."}

Given the patientos high operative risk and her clinical picture favouring sepsis, endoscopic ultrasonographical fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) which was performed, revealed pus with acid-fast bacilli seen in the cell block material. The patient was started on antituberculous medication with rapid improvement of symptoms. Pancreatic tuberculosis (TB) is rare and can mimic pancreatic carcinoma both clinically and radiologically.

Retrospective analysis of 303 children less than 2 years of age with first time non-obstructive urinary tract infection investigated by both urography and DMSA scintigraphy. At DMSA scintigraphy, renal lesions and/or relative function below 45% was considered abnormal. Urography was used as reference for the diagnosis of duplication. Duplex kidneys were found in 22 of 303 patients (7%). Of the 16 children with unilateral duplication, 10 had bilaterally undamaged kidneys with a range of relative function varying between 51% and 57% in the duplex kidney. In two of the children with unilateral duplication the imaging results were discordant. There was risk of underdiagnosis as well as overdiagnosis of renal damage at scintigraphy. Although it is important to be aware of this risk, the rate of misinterpretation was low. A range of 51% to 57% can be used as the limit for normality of the relative function of a unilateral duplex kidney."}

We studied the relationship among vesicoureteral reflux, urinary tract infection and permanent renal damage in children. We retrospectively analyzed 303 children younger than 2 years with a first time, nonobstructive, culture verified urinary tract infection. The protocol included ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrography within 3 months after urinary tract infection, and (99m)technetium dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy after 1 to 2 years. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 36 of 163 boys (22%) and in 44 of 140 girls (31%). Of the 303 patients 80 (26%) had permanent renal damage according to dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy. The rate of abnormality increased significantly with grade of vesicoureteral reflux in boys and girls. The relative risk of renal damage was significantly increased in patients with vesicoureteral reflux grade II and higher. Maximum C-reactive protein concentration, maximum temperature during urinary tract infection, presence of vesicoureteral reflux and febrile recurrences of urinary tract infection were significantly related to permanent renal damage. In stepwise logistic regression vesicoureteral reflux was the only independent variable for boys, while C-reactive protein and vesicoureteral reflux were independent factors for girls. There was a significant relationship between grade II vesicoureteral reflux and higher and permanent renal damage in boys and girls. However, while the association between renal damage and vesicoureteral reflux was evident in boys, the role of urinary tract infection and renal inflammation seemed to be equally or more important in girls. These findings support the concept that renal damage is associated with vesicoureteral reflux and is often congenital in boys, while in girls it is more related to urinary tract infection with vesicoureteral reflux as a reinforcing factor."}

The investigation of UTI in children has been the subject of debate and controversy for many years. Most workers agree that the first imaging modality to be used should be an ultrasound examination to exclude obstruction, structural abnormalities, and renal calculi. The role of (99m)Tc dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA) in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is becoming increasingly important. Many argue that if the DMSA study is normal at the time of acute UTI, no further investigation is required because the kidneys have not been involved and thus there will be no late sequelae. Others use the acute DMSA study to determine the intensity of antibiotic therapy. The importance of the role of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) is being debated. Some workers will only proceed to cystography to detect VUR if the DMSA study is abnormal, whereas others advocate a more aggressive approach. VUR can be identified by a variety of radiological and scintigraphic techniques. Although the radiological cystogram is the gold standard and is essential in the first UTI in a male patient, to exclude the presence of posterior urethral valves, radionuclide cystograms are advantageous in other situations. Suprapubic cystography techniques have been described to overcome the trauma of urethral catheterization but have not been widely accepted."}

The aim of this study is to investigate the variability in the interpretation of (99m)Tc-DMSA scans, evaluate the usefulness of oblique images, and assess their impact on scan interpretation. Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians independently interpreted 100 (99m)Tc-DMSA scans (197 kidneys) 4 times. Interpretation was twice based on posterior projection images and twice based on posterior and posterior oblique projection images. For each kidney, the observers had to choose between the following results: normal, abnormal, and indeterminate. The indices of variability used were the percentage of agreement, kappa-statistic, and marginal homogeneity. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility (kappa-values) varied between 0.683 and 0.708 and between 0.609 and 0.671, respectively, for posterior images. Disagreement in (99m)Tc-DMSA scan interpretation occurred in 18% of kidneys within observers and in 21% of kidneys between observers when only posterior images were used. Oblique views changed the interpretation in 14% and 11.5% of kidneys for the first and second observers, respectively. The use of oblique views increased the agreement rate within and between observers (kappa-values, 0.725-0.812 and 0.768-0.732, respectively; mean agreement, 86.5 and 87.25, respectively). Oblique views were found useful in approximately 13% of kidneys and affected inter- and intraobserver variability. Our results suggest that oblique views should be used routinely in children with clinically suspected urinary tract infection to reliably interpret images."}

Fever can be caused by different reasons such as environmental conditions, acute rejection after kidney transplantation and bacterial diseases including kidney and urinary tract infections. The present study represents a novel idea of investigating the direct effect of body temperature elevation on kidney function to determine whether hyperthermia alters the kidney function transiently leading to inaccurate findings and possible misinterpretation of the radionuclide (99mTc-MAG-3) renography studies. Renography studies were performed on New Zealand White rabbits weighing approximately 3-3.5 kg. Each rabbit was inject with 48.1 MBq (1.3 mCi) technetium-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG-3). Studies were acquired using a gamma camera equipped with a low-energy, high-resolution collimator interfaced with a computer. Dynamic images were acquired as 2-s frames for the first 1 min and every 30 s for the next 30 min on a matrix of 64 x 64. Regions of interest were drawn over the whole kidneys. Radioactivity time curves were generated from the regions of interest. Time to peak activity (Tmax), time from peak to 50% activity (T1/2), and the uptake slope of each kidney were calculated from the renograms. Three days later the same protocol was repeated for the same rabbit but with a higher body temperature by 2 degrees C. Then it was repeated with a higher body temperature by 3 degrees C, then 4 degrees C with the same interval period. Blood pressure was measured using a catheter inserted into the femoral artery connected to a Lectromid recorder at normal temperature and during increasing the temperature by 2, 3 and 4 degrees C. Renal blood flow was also measured via the renal artery using an electromagnetic blood flow sensor connected to a flowmeter. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in blood were measured in control and hyperthermic rabbits. During hyperthermia the experimental curves shifted to the right of the control curves indicating that there was a delayed renal uptake of 99mTc-MAG-3 and clearance of radioactivity. This delay was proportional to body temperature. Calculated averages were: Tmax 1.6 +/- 0.1, 2.8 +/- 0.3, 8.8 +/- 1, 15 +/- 4 min; T1/2 2.77 +/- 0.2, 3 +/- 0.4, 8.9 +/- 1.1, 20 +/- 3.4 min, and perfusion index 190 +/- 5, 201 +/- 4, 218 +/- 7, 224 +/- 9 of control and hyperthermic (elevation of temperature 2, 3, and 4 degrees C) rabbits, respectively (n = 6; p < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure and renal blood flow did not significantly change during hyperthermia. Creatinine and BUN were proportionally elevated to high temperature. Our results indicate that hyperthermia causes a transient alteration in the function of the kidney and scintigraphic pattern on radionuclide renography. Radionuclide renography studies may be performed at normothermic temperature since interpretation at higher body temperature could lead to misleading results, and temperature should be checked and recorded for single and follow-up radionuclide renography studies."}

An increased frequency of infections has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease. The tendency of patients in this population to acquire UTI is not completely understood. We aimed at investigating the incidence of UTI in children with cirrhosis, before liver transplantation. Twenty-six children (9 girls, 17 boys; mean age, 7.66 +/- 5.73 yr) with chronic liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation between 2002 and 2004 were included. On admission for liver transplantation, patients were examined for presence of UTI. Serum biochemistry, complete blood cell count, urinalysis and culture, glomerular filtration rate, and abdominal ultrasonography were performed prior to liver transplantation. Ten of 26 patients (38.5%) were found to have symptomatic UTI. Urine cultures revealed E. coli in five (50%), Klebsiella pneumoniae in three (30%), Enterococcus faecalis in one (10%), and Enterobacter aeruginosa in one (10%) patient(s), respectively, as etiologic factors. The etiologies of chronic liver disease in our patients with UTI were BA in five, PFIC in three, Wilson's disease in one, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in one patient. We found a significantly greater number of UTIs in patients with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia (p < 0.05). The mean age of the patients with UTI was 2.75 +/- 3.49 yr, which was significantly lower than in those without UTI (9.75 +/- 4.86 yr, p < 0.05). Levels for white blood cells, thrombocytes, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in patients with UTI than in those without UTI. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to serum albumin, bilirubin, AST, GGT, BUN, or creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, duration of disease, and PELD scores. In patients with bacteriuria, renal USG revealed normal findings in all, but except one patient who had pelvicalyceal dilatation. Scintigraphic findings demonstrated acute pyelonephritis in six (60%) patients with UTI. VCUG demonstrated vesicoureteral reflux in two patients. In conclusion, symptomatic UTI is common in children with cirrhosis. It occurs more frequently in patients with biliary atresia than it does in patients with other types of chronic liver disease. In febrile children with chronic liver disease, UTI should be considered in the differential diagnosis."}

This prospective study was conducted to elucidate and distinguish the bacterial virulence factors associated with ALN and acute pyelonephritis (APN) in pediatric patients. Patients included in the present study were those suspected of an upper urinary tract infection who underwent ultrasonographic, computed tomographic and technetium 99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphic evaluation to distinguish between ALN and APN. The E. coli isolates from the urine samples of patients were screened with polymerase chain reaction analysis for various urovirulence genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the genetic association of the isolates. A total of 88 patients were enrolled. Forty-six patients were diagnosed with ALN and 42 with APN. Demographic characteristics and clinical results were similar except for longer fever duration before admission, longer fever continuation following antibiotic treatment and higher C-reactive protein values noted in the ALN group. Diverse genotypes were found among the E. coli isolates in both groups. Among the pathogenetic determinants examined, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a papG II allele was the only significant urovirulence factor associated with ALN (P < 0.005; odds ratio, 17.16). This association was independent of the presence of VUR. While no specific genetic lineage was identified among the E. coli isolates studied, a papG II gene was found to be strongly associated with the cause of ALN among pediatric patients."}

All studies on this subject have been performed at paediatric teaching centres whereas most children with UTIs are managed by General Paediatricians in District General Hospitals (DGHs) in the United Kingdom. We wished to identify whether results of scans in DGHs differed from those in teaching centres. We looked at all children with a clinical history of UTIs having a DMSA and USS over a one year period in two DGHs and one teaching centre. A total of 476 children's results were reviewed, 297 from the DGHs and 179 from the teaching centre. The cohort had a total of 949 renal units. There were 79 scarred renal units (kidneys) on DMSA (8%) in 72 patients (15%). Just 18 renal units were detected as being scarred on USS (22.8%). Nine of 32 scarred renal units in the teaching centre were detected compared with nine of 47 in the DGHs (P = 0.40). Thirty-nine (49%) of the scarred renal units were in patients >5-years old. Of these 12 (30.7%) were detected on USS, nine of 17 within the teaching centre compared with just three of 22 at the DGHs (P = 0.01). Overall only a small percentage of scars are detected on USS. In the over 5-year old group, where USS alone might be preferred, DGHs were significantly worse at detecting scarred kidneys. We conclude that if the detection of renal scars is a prime reason for imaging in children with UTIs, ultrasonography alone is inappropriate at any age and DMSA ought to be the primary investigation."}

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a possible warning sign of the presence of anomalies of the urinary tract. Following a UTI there is concern with recurrences which can contribute to scarring which may lead to hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension and even renal failure in later years. Prospective studies using 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) have shown that 30%-40% of children will have renal scarring after febrile UTI, regardless of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Many studies have demonstrated that VUR is an important risk factor for renal scarring after UTI. Hypertension affects at least 10% of children with renal scarring, and in adults with reflux nephropathy (RN), the prevalence of hypertension is also much higher (38%-50%). UTI, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or renal function deterioration alone or in some combination has been reported to be as high as 39% in women with renal scarring. RN is one of the important causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. Prevention of renal scar development should reduce the incidence of hypertension in patients as they age. The appropriate management of childhood UTI includes education of parents, patients and general physicians to be sure that everyone is aware of not only the current condition, but also the possibility of future UTI-related situations. UTI itself is a warning sign of possible anomalies of the urinary tract, renal problems and/or chronic renal complications. Although VUR is primarily a disease of childhood, scarring from the disease can cause problems in later years, with the complicating factor that because only the renal scar remains, the VUR may be forgotten and not considered when diagnosing the current problem."}

Report the results of laparoscopic upper-pole nephroureterectomy in infants. Six consecutive infants underwent 7 laparoscopic upper-pole nephroureterectomy. Pre and postoperative evaluation included renal sonography, voiding cystourethrogram and renal scintigraphy. All infants showed upper-pole exclusion. Surgery was performed through a transperitoneal approach with full flank position in all infants. Three or 4 ports were used according to the necessity of retracting the liver. The distal ureter was ligated close to the bladder whenever reflux was present and the dysplastic upper-pole was divided with the help of an electrocautery. Data regarding operative time, postoperative use of analgesics, time to resume oral feeding, hospital stay and tubular function were collected and analyzed. All procedures were concluded as planned. Mean operative time was 135 min. One patient underwent staged bilateral upper-pole nephrectomy. There were no complications and the postoperative hospital stay was 48 hours in 5 procedures and 24 hours in 2 procedures. Pain medication was required only in the first day. Renal tubular function showed improvement in half of the cases. Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is a safe and feasible procedure in infants. Due to the magnification provided by the lenses, a better vision of the structures is achieved, facilitating selective dissection of vascular upper-pole, renal parenchyma and distal ureter. This approach is less damaging to the lower pole, and is associated to low morbidity and a short hospital stay."}

The aim of this study was to analyze the thrombotic risk, assessed by platelet aggregation and aspirin non-responsiveness, in patients with an acute coronary syndrome complicated by an infection. Patients with an acute coronary syndrome who were admitted to the intensive care unit and hospitalized for at least 3 days in 2002 and 2003 were eligible for the study. Three hundred and fifty-eight patients were included, of whom 66 had an infection during their hospital stay. Platelet aggregation was analyzed by an aggregometer using laser light (PA-200, laser light scattering). Aspirin non-responsiveness was defined as a closure time of <or=193 s measured by PFA-100. Platelet aggregation was more pronounced during an infectious complication (P < 0.001). The subgroups of patients with persistent fever, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia all had a higher level of aggregates than the group of patients without an infection (P = 0.007, P = 0.04, and P = 0.01, respectively). Aspirin non-responsiveness was more frequent in the group of subjects with pneumonia compared with those without an infection, 90% vs. 46% (P = 0.006). The CRP levels were independently associated with platelet aggregation and aspirin non-responsiveness (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). An infectious complication during the course of an acute coronary syndrome leads to more pronounced platelet aggregation. Aspirin non-responsiveness is more frequent in severe infections, such as pneumonia. CRP is an independent predictor of platelet aggregation and aspirin non-responsiveness in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome."}

Genomic DNA was obtained from 265 children with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of urinary tract infection who were recruited in northeast Italy. The children were subdivided as 173 who were dimercapto-succinic acid scan positive with positive static renal scintigraphy in acute conditions, consistent with the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, and 92 who were dimercapto-succinic acid scan negative. Genetic analysis for the same polymorphisms was also extended to a control population of 106 umbilical cord DNA samples. Statistical analysis of genotype data showed that 1) the tested populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, 2) there were significant differences between the dimercapto-succinic acid scan positive and negative groups (p=0.049), and the dimercapto-succinic acid scan positive group vs controls (p=0.032) in terms of interleukin-8 -251A>T polymorphism frequency, 3) there was also a significant difference in the distribution of IL-8 -251A>T and +2767A>G polymorphisms between dimercapto-succinic acid scan positive and negative children in the subgroup without vesicoureteral reflux (p=0.03 and 0.02, respectively) and 4) no significant differences were found in the frequency of the distribution of CXCR1 +2607G>C polymorphism in all groups.

Children with VUR (group 1) vs. no VUR (group 2) and children with high-grade (III-V) VUR (group 3) vs. no or low-grade (I-II) VUR (group 4) were compared. Among 88 patients (24 male), 38 had VUR and 21 high-grade VUR. Fever > or = 38.5 degrees C was associated with VUR [odds ratio (OR): 7.5]. CRP level of 50 mg/l was the best cut-off level for predicting high-grade VUR (OR 15.5; discriminative ability 0.89 +/- 0.05). Performing voiding cystourethrography based on this CRP level would result in failure to notice 9% of patients with high-grade VUR, whereas 69% of children with no/low-grade VUR would be spared from this invasive test. In conclusion, fever > or = 38 degrees C and CRP > 50 mg/l seem to be potentially useful clinical predictors of VUR and high-grade VUR, respectively, in pediatric patients with UTI. Further validation of these findings could limit unnecessary voiding cystourethrography."}

Despite the drastic change in the evaluation of the febrile young child due to the decreased incidence of serious bacterial infections (SBI) effected by Haemophilus influenza type B and pneumococcal vaccine, there remains a small role for blood work in the evaluation of these patients. Bacterial markers including white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been studied and are widely used as predictors of SBI in febrile children. It has been suggested that CRP values should be interpreted cautiously when fever has been present <12 h based on the kinetics of this biological marker. This limitation has not been previously addressed with CRP, nor was it described with other markers, specifically WBC and ANC, therefore the purpose of the present paper was to assess WBC, ANC and CRP values as predictors of SBI in relation to duration of fever. Patients who presented to a pediatric emergency department between the ages of 1 and 36 months, with fever > or =39 degrees C and no source of infection had a complete blood count (CBC) blood culture, and CRP level drawn. A urinalysis and/or urine culture was obtained when age and gender appropriate. A chest X-ray was performed at the discretion of the treating physician. The study subjects were enrolled prospectively and then divided into two groups based on duration of fever of < or = or >12 h, and compared. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were originally enrolled. Nine patients were excluded. Seventeen patients (14%) had SBI. One patient (<1%) had bacteremia, three (3%) had pneumonia, and 13 (10%) had urinary tract infections. Forty-five patients presented with fever < or =12 h and 74 patients presented with fever >12 h. Area under the curve (AUC) for WBC, ANC and CRP was significantly larger in patients with SBI presenting with fever >12 h (0.85, 0.83, 0.92 respectively) compared to patients with SBI who presented with fever for <12 h (0.37, 0.42, 0.68 respectively). Bacterial markers studied were more predictive of SBI if the duration of fever was >12 h as shown by the AUC. CRP performed better than WBC and ANC in both scenarios."}

Specific features, concomitant pathologies and useful diagnostic investigations]. In a retrospective analysis we studied the case histories of 31 children who had been seen in our department for investigation of pelvic ectopic kidney between January 1994 and June 2005. The evaluation of each involved the medical history, ultrasound examination, VCUG, and DMSA scan or MAG3 diuresis renogram. Of the 31 children, 21 (67.7%) had initially been referred to our department for further investigation and clarification because renal agenesis was suspected. In the remaining 10 (32.3%) children the pelvic kidney was an incidental finding observed during investigation of various other conditions. Overall, 7 (22.6%) of the 31 were symptomatic (recurrent urinary tract infections, abdominal pain, hypertension, hydronephrosis), while 77.4% (24/31) were completely free of symptoms at the time of follow-up. Ultrasound revealed that the ectopic kidney was on the left in 64.5% (20/31) of these cases. Nuclear scans performed both at the time of the initial diagnosis and at follow-up were available for 11 of the 31 children and showed a mild improvement of the partial function of the pelvic kidney, from a mean of 25.6% to a mean of 34.6%. In conclusion, whenever renal agenesis is suspected on ultrasonographic examination, the investigator should first consider renal ectopia; ultrasound examination with the bladder full is the definitive diagnostic procedure. For asymptomatic cases we recommend regular ultrasound monitoring of the kidney -- at first every 6 months and later once a year. In cases with complex anatomy MRI is a suitable method for further diagnostic work-up."}

The prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), although reported to be low in the general population, is high in children with urinary tract infection (UTI), first degree relatives of patients with known VUR and children with antenatal hydronephrosis. In addition, it has been shown that VUR and UTIs are associated with renal scarring, predisposing to serious long-term complications, i.e., hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency and complications of pregnancy. Therefore, diagnostic imaging for the detection of VUR in the high-risk groups of children has been a standard practice. However, none of these associations has been validated with controlled studies, and recently the value of identifying VUR after a symptomatic UTI has been questioned. In addition, several studies have shown that renal damage may occur in the absence of VUR. On the other hand, some patients, mainly males, may have primary renal damage, associated with high-grade VUR, without UTI. Recently, increasing skepticism has been noted concerning how and for whom it is important to investigate for VUR. It has been suggested that the absence of renal lesions after the first UTI in children may rule out VUR of clinical significance and reinforces the redundancy of invasive diagnostic techniques. Therefore, the priority of imaging strategies should focus on early identification of renal lesions to prevent further deterioration."}

Vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common inherited disorder of the lower urinary tract. Children with VUR are at risk for ongoing renal damage with subsequent infections. IL8 is an important inflammatory mediator which can be produced by epithelial cells of the renal tract in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli. High serum concentrations of IL-8 have been reported in patients with chronic renal failure. Elevated IL-8 levels have been reported in the urine of patients with VUR and renal parenchymal scarring (RPS). More recently it was reported that urine IL-8 levels remain elevated in infants with VUR even in the absence of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Increased IL-8 expression has been shown to be associated with polymorphism at position -251 (rs4073) of the IL-8 promoter. The aim of this study was to examine the association of IL-8 gene polymorphism with familial VUR in a cohort of 219 siblings from 109 families affected with VUR, the largest such cohort tested to date. RPS was assessed using dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. Genotyping was performed in 219 siblings with VUR (157 without RPS, 62 with RPS) and 292 controls for the position -251 of IL-8 gene by polymerase chain reaction with tetra primers and gel analysis. Genotype was compared using the chi square test. Statistical significance was taken as a value of P < 0.05. There were no significant differences in IL-8 -251 genotype frequency between VUR patients and controls. Similarly, gender, severity of VUR and renal parenchymal scarring had no effect on IL-8 -251 genotype frequency. Although IL-8 urinary levels have been reported to be elevated in VUR, our data indicate that IL-8 gene is not involved in the pathogenesis of familial VUR or reflux nephropathy."}

Therefore, we sought to determine the accuracy of PCT in discriminating between pyelonephritis with adverse medical outcome (PAMO) and pyelonephritis without adverse medical outcome (PWAMO). Adult women with pyelonephritis presenting to the emergency department of a French tertiary care hospital were consecutively included. Those patients who developed adverse medical outcomes during a 28-d follow-up period were identified as having PAMO. Baseline characteristics and PCT level were compared between patients with PAMO and PWAMO. Eleven women (19.0%) had PAMO and 47 (81%) had PWAMO. The median PCT level was higher in PAMO compared with PWAMO 0.51 ng/ml (IQR: 0.04-3.8) and 0.08 ng/ml (IQR: 0.01-1.0), but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.07). We failed to find a threshold value for PCT that discriminated between PAMO and PWAMO (ROC, AUC=0.67 [95%CI, 0.51-0.86]). All but one subject with PAMO had either a PCT level >0.1 ng/ml or an underlying genitourinary abnormality by radiographic testing. A single PCT level was a poor predictor of 28-d adverse medical outcomes in women with pyelonephritis treated in the emergency department.

In the past few years, procalcitonin has been proposed as a sensitive and specific inflammatory marker in various fields of medicine, especially in infectivology, where it has been used to discriminate between bacterial infections, viral infections and inflammation processes. Recently, different studies have emerged in the literature on the use of this marker to identify renal involvement in febrile urinary tract infections. Procalcitonin seems to be a valid biological marker, with an acceptable sensitivity and specificity, which predicts a renal involvement of the infection (pyelonephritis), in comparison with the low specificity of C-reactive protein. Procalcitonin also seems to be correlated with the degree of the involvement at the moment of diagnosis of febrile urinary tract infections and with scarring. Renal involvement has always been the main diagnostic objective in children with febrile urinary tract infections. If more studies confirm the correlation between procalcitonin, renal involvement during urinary infections and scar formation, we will finally have a noninvasive tool that can identify children at risk of complications and in need of a close follow-up as early as their first episode of febrile urinary tract infection."}

Monoclonal antibodies were produced using purified uristatin and screened for binding differences to uristatin, bikunin, P-alpha-I, and I-alpha-I. Antibody-binding patterns were characterized using immunoaffinity binding onto protein-chip surfaces and analysis by Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization mass spectrometry (SELDI), using specimens from patients and from purified uTi standards. Antibodies were developed and used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for uTi measurement in urine and plasma specimens. ELISA was performed on specimens from normal, presumed healthy, controls and from patients who had been screened for inflammation using a high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) test and a complete blood count (CBC). Polyclonal antibody against uTi showed cross-reactivity with the Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) and with proinhibitors. Screening of anti-uTi monoclonal antibodies (Mab) revealed antibodies that did not cross-react with either of the above, thus providing a tool to measure both uristatin and bikunin in urine with Mab 3G5 and in plasma with Mab 5D11. The monoclonal antibody 5D11 cross-reacts with specific N-linked glycoconjugates of uristatin present in plasma.

Paediatric patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) have risk of developing renal scarrings. Although it is known that vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) predisposes to UTIs and it seems to have an important role in the development of renal lesions, some recent published studies question that relation. The aim of the study was to evaluate renal scarring by using renal scintigraphy 99mTc-DMSA and see the relation with or without the presence of VUR. We evaluated retrospectively a total of 230 patients (460 renal units), mean age: 11 months (range: 12d-5y), with UTI probed by urinoculture. All were studied with voiding cistourethrography (MCU) to evaluate the presence or absence of VUR. Patients were evaluated with 99mTc-DMSA scan 6 months after UTI to determine if UTI caused renal scarring. Renal scans with 99mTc-DMSA 6 months post-infection were abnormal in 62 renal units, affecting 54 patients (23 %). From all patients studied, 110 were diagnosis of VUR being affected 161 renal units, 43 of them (27 %) presented renal scarrings. From the remaining 120 patients without VUR that is 240 renal units, 19 of them (8 %) presented parenchymatous damage. Renal scarring resulting from UTI are in some cases related to VUR, but sometimes are caused by the infection itself. Not all patients with VUR develop renal lesions, and neither the presence of VUR always predispose children to renal lesions. MCU and direct isotopic cystography are useful for diagnosis of VUR but we shouldn't avoid 99mTc-DMSA scan in the management of children with UTI."}

On the basis of presentation, XGP was classified as complicated and simple. There were 18 cases of XGP. The clinical characteristics included: calculi or obstruction in the urinary tract, and damage to the kidney, complication of urinary tract infection, anaemia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and liver dysfunction. All patients had diffuse XGP. Associated pathological findings such as psoas abscess, nephrocutaneous fistula, renocolonic fistula and paranephric abscess were found in 33.3% of cases. Eleven of 14 patients (78.6%) who were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) had the correct diagnosis made prior to nephrectomy. Urine culture was positive in 88.9% of patients and Proteus mirabilis was the most common organism. Our experience with a small number of patients demonstrates that low socioeconomic status could be a risk factor in the development of complicated cases of XGP. CT is considered to be the best radiological test for correct preoperative diagnosis and evaluation of XGP. Nephrectomy and removal of all surrounding affected tissue proved to be curative for XGP."}

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral reflux in this subset of patients. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 13 female patients presenting with clinical pyelonephritis between 2001 and 2005. All of these patients had either a history of vesicoureteral reflux in childhood or a family history of reflux, or had previously undergone surgery for reflux. All patients underwent voiding cystourethrogram and dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan as part of the evaluation. Of the 13 individuals evaluated 9 had vesicoureteral reflux. Of these patients 5 had been operated on previously for vesicoureteral reflux, 2 had a strong family history of reflux and 2 had reflux as a child with documented resolution. Six of the 9 patients with reflux exhibited renal scarring on dimercapto-succinic acid renal scintigraphy. Endoscopic correction of reflux was done in all 9 patients and was successful in 8, as shown on voiding cystourethrogram at 3 months postoperatively. One patient required a second procedure, which was successful.

On admission, laboratory findings revealed pyuria, inflammatory changes, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Computed tomography showed left ureteral stone and hydronephrosis. Gallium scintigraphy showed avid uptake in the left kidney. Serum concentration of vancomycin was 57.4 micro/ml. Candida glabrata was isolated from blood, sputum and urine. Under the diagnosis of fungemia and left pyelonephritis, he was treated with micafungin (150 mg/day), gabexate mesilate and insertion of a double-ended pigtail catheter. The above treatment produced regression of systemic inflammation, DIC and acute renal failure. At the last follow-up 3 weeks after discharge, ureteroscopy showed that the ureter stone had already passed but a soft white-yellowish bezoar was detected in the ureter.

Therefore, we evaluated prevalence, short and long-term morbidity and confounding factors of febrile UTI (fUTI) after paediatric RTx. In a retrospective cross-sectional study of three centres, we analysed data on 110 children followed for 4.9+/-3.4 years after successful transplantation. 40/110 (36%) patients had at least one fUTI at a median time of 0.98 years (range 0.02-8.96) after RTx; 11 patients (28%) had recurrent fUTI. Serum creatinine (SCr) rose significantly from 1.15+/-1.13 to 1.83+/-1.69 mg/dl, (P<0.001) during the fUTI, declining to baseline values after treatment. At the last followed-up calculated mean, GFR was comparable between fUTI and non-fUTI groups (75+/-26 vs 71+/-22 ml/min/1.73 m2). During fUTI mean, C-reactive protein (CRP) increased to 123+/-75 mg/l. Febrile UTI were significantly more frequent in girls compared to boys (22/44 vs 18/66, P<0.05) but occurred significantly earlier in boys than in girls [median 0.63 (range 0.02-4.15) vs 1.07 (0.04-8.96) years after RTx; P<0.02]. Also, patients with urinary tract malformations (UTMs) and neurogenic bladder as underlying diagnosis and those with urological surgery prior to transplantation had an increased risk for fUTI. fUTI is a frequent complication with significant short-term morbidity especially in girls and children with UTMs, neurogenic bladder and those with urological surgery.

The purpose of the study was to assess serum TGF-beta1 level in children with reflux nephropathy. The study comprised 36 children (12 boys and 24 girls) aged 1-17 years with vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring confirmed by scintigraphic evaluation. In most children recurrent urinary tract infections were observed. In 13 (27.8%) children, a first episode of urinary tract infection occurred in infancy.

These values were based on data from children with a normal left to right ratio and a normal appearance on DMSA scintigraphy, despite the presence of an acute renal infection. At that time, the authors were unaware that hyperfiltration is a common phenomenon in patients with acute renal infection and that their normal values could have been significantly overestimated. The present work therefore aimed to re-appraise these normal values. In a first step, in order to verify the previous results, the same type of population was selected, namely patients with present or past urinary tract infection but normal images and a normal left to right ratio on DMSA scintigraphy. In a second step, the selection was based on patients who had had no recent urinary tract infection. In both series, a single blood sample method was used for the evaluation of (51)Cr-EDTA clearance. In the first group of patients, the results obtained were almost identical to those previously published. In the second group of patients, the results were significantly lower: after 2 years of age, the mean GFR value was 104 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (10th and 90th percentiles 81 and 135 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively), compared with 117 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in the first group.

The patients (median age 48 years) comprised three females and two males. Median post-transplant follow-up was 3 months, with three patients having predisposing factors for diabetes and one for an enteric bladder. None of the patients presented the 'classic' diagnostic tetrad (i.e. fever, positive urine cultures, low urinary tract symptoms and serum creatinine increase); although, at diagnosis, two of five patients presented with fever, one had increased creatinine levels and one had positive urine cultures. Of note, three patients had leucocyte casts at urinary sediment analysis, thus raising clinical suspicion. Renal ultrasounds were negative in all patients. Renal (99m)Tc-MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) scintigraphy, which was used for the definition of kidney function impairment (one patient) or because of the presence of urinary casts (three patients), or after the biopsy diagnosis to locate the parenchymal lesions (one patient), was positive in all patients. The presence and pyelonephritic origin of the parenchymal lesions was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance or computed tomography scans. Acute graft pyelonephritis may develop in the absence of a full-blown clinical picture. Smouldering symptoms may occur in the presence of large perfusion deficits.

The timing of the test, i.e., whether an acute 99mTc-DMSA scan, a follow-up only or both scans should be performed, however, remains open to discussion. In our study, a six-month follow- up DMSA scan was performed in all the children diagnosed with a first attack of acute pyelonephritis (APN) in two large paediatric clinics of Charles University's 3rd School of Medicine in Prague during a five-year period. All diagnoses were confirmed by a paediatric nephrologist. 382 children (267 girls, 115 boys) aged between 7 months and 19 years were included in the study. For analytical purposes, the patients were divided into 4 age groups: I--less than 1 year of age, II--1-5 years, III--5-10 years, and IV--10-19 years. In all children younger than five years, a micturition cystourethrogram (MCUG) for detection of vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was performed between one and three months after the APN episode. Static renal scintigraphy, using an HR collimator with parallel holes was performed using a planar Gamma camera MB 9200 (Gamma Budapest) in all children six months after APN, with a complement of pinhole images, SPECT or PSPECT of the kidneys. 1. In group I, all four children with positive VUR on MCUG had a pathological DMSA scan, while only two of the 32 patients with negative VUR had a pathological DMSA. 2. In group II, 17 children had VUR on MCUG, six of them with a pathological and 11 with a normal DMSA scan. Most of the 221 children without VUR had a normal DMSA scintigraphy; pathological findings were present in 17 children only. 3. In group III, all children with VUR, but only 5 out of 53 without VUR, had a pathological DMSA scan. 4. Five out of 50 children in group IV had a pathological DMSA. APN occurred most frequently in group II (62.3%, or 238 children) and ranged between 10-15% in the remaining groups. APN was found very frequently in boys less than one year old and showed a marked decrease with increasing age. Among girls, however, APN incidence was observed to increase with age. Pathological renal changes were present in children with, as well as without, VUR. The incidence of pathological DMSA findings six months after APN was relatively low (44/382 patients, or 11.5%). Regular monitoring of these children is very important for detection of renal scarring."}

The prevalence of renal scars did not vary significantly according to the grade of VUR. The CRP level on admission was significantly higher in patients with acute renal defect and scar. In conclusion, VUR increases the risk of post-pyelonephritic renal scars in children."}

Magnetic resonance imaging can provide both a detailed anatomic and functional assessment of the pediatric genitourinary tract in a single study without the use of ionizing radiation. Magnetic resonance urography combines static and dynamic evaluation of the urinary tract following contrast administration and has been most often applied to the evaluation of hydronephrosis. In addition to unparalleled anatomic assessment, it allows for the evaluation of glomerular filtration rate, renal transit time, and differential renal function. It also provides unique insights into a wide range of obstructive uropathies and has been demonstrated to be useful in the evaluation of complex genitourinary anomalies. Magnetic resonance voiding cystourethrography has been used to rule out vesicoureteral reflux. Magnetic resonance imaging has also been demonstrated to be superior to nuclear scintigraphy for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of pediatric genitourinary anomalies. It provides functional and anatomic assessment with a single procedure that in most cases is superior to conventional procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging will probably become the modality of choice for the imaging of pediatric genitourinary tract anomalies."}

Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1: (n = 45) received antibiotics prior to a definitive diagnosis of appendicitis. Group 2: (n = 266) did not receive antibiotics prior to a diagnosis of appendicitis. Group 1 patients were significantly younger and more likely to be female than in group 2. Abdominal tenderness was less marked and there was a greater reliance on radiological investigations in patients receiving antibiotics. C-reactive protein and pre-operative temperature were significantly higher in group 1 patients compared to group 2. The perforation rate and complication rate were significantly greater in group 1. The commonest misdiagnoses were urinary tract infection and respiratory infection. Initial misdiagnosis results in significant delay before appendicectomy. This study shows that the clinical signs of acute appendicitis can be masked by prior treatment with antibiotics.

Direct radionuclide cystography (DRC) has been advocated for the detection of VUR with increased sensitivity and low radiation doses, however, having the disadvantage of providing less anatomical details for urethral evaluation. In this study, DRC has been compared with standard fluoroscopic VCUG for detection of VUR. A total of 41 children (82 kidney ureter units, KUU) aged 1 month-126 months (median, 15 months) were studied sequentially using DRC and VCUG. The indications of VUR studied were urinary tract infection in 29 children, VUR follow up in eight children and antenatal dilatation history in four children. A total of 18 refluxing ureters were detected by DRC, 22 refluxing ureters by VCUG and 14 refluxing ureters by both methods. The two methods were concordant for the detection and exclusion of VUR in 85% of KUU. VUR was missed by VCUG in four KUU (three severe, one mild) whereas VUR was missed by DRC in eight KUU (four grade I, four grade III). There was a good correlation between DRC and VCUG in the evaluation of VUR. DRC provides continuous monitoring and low gonadal radiation exposure.

In 113 children, reflux resolved spontaneously, 27 underwent surgical or endoscopic correction and 46 are being followed-up to date. Spontaneous resolution after prophylaxis was more frequent in boys (p < 0.0001), in children with grade I or II (p < 0.0001) and unilateral reflux at diagnosis (p = 0.0215). No significant difference could be established with respect to the presence of scars (p = 0.1680) and the number of breakthrough urinary tract infections (p = 0.1078).

To assess the utility of positional instillation of contrast (PIC) cystography in detecting vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in patients with renal scarring from recurrent febrile urinary tract infections that standard voiding cystourethrography and nuclear cystogram imaging failed to reveal. Between June 2004 and November 2004, a total of 5 pediatric patients with recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and radiologic evidence of upper tract involvement were examined with PIC cystography. All patients had at least one previous negative standard reflux study (voiding cystourethrography or nuclear cystography). All 5 patients showed VUR on PIC cystography. Unilateral reflux was detected in 3 patients, and 2 patients had bilateral VUR. The PIC cystogram should be integrated into the algorithm for diagnosing patients with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, who do not exhibit VUR on standard imaging modalities. The morbidity associated with undiagnosed VUR, as demonstrated by this group of patients, suggests that permanent renal damage may be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment."}

Acute pyelonephritis in children can leave a kidney scar that eventually can lead to hypertension or renal failure. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy (RC DMSA) is a widely accepted technique to assess children with acute pyelonephritis. To evaluate the presence of residual kidney scars detected through RC DMSA, in children with a first episode of acute pyelonephritis. Clinical records of children with a first episode of acute pyelonephritis that were assessed within seven days of the episode with RC DMSA were reviewed. Children were considered eligible if they did not have a new episode of acute pyelonephritis and a second RC DMSA, one year after the first episode, was performed. The presence or absence of a renal scar after one year was associated to demographic, scintigraphy and laboratory variables. Fifty nine children, aged 1 month to 10 years, 35 females, were studied. Thirty nine percent had a renal scar in the scintigraphy perfomed after one year of follow up. The presence of a scar was correlated with a C reactive protein over 130 mg/dl and an altered relative renal function (below 44%), during the acute phase. A high C reactive protein and alterations of relative renal function during the acute phase of acute pyelonephritis in children, may be risk factors for the development of renal scars in the long term follow up."}

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is detected in 30-50% of pediatric patients diagnosed of urinary tract infection (UTI). Multiple clinical trials have compared the results of conservative management against surgical therapy. The introduction of a third alternative in 1984 (endoscopic approach) has dramatically modified the management of VUR. The objective of our work is to analyze the factors influencing the favourable outcome of the endoscopic treatment of VUR. Retrospective and prospective cohort study analyzing 90 patients with grades III and IV VUR treated endoscopically over the last eight years. 184 patients undergoing endoscopic management were selected from a group of 550 patients (735 VUR renal units) with the diagnosis of VUR over the study period. All patients underwent VCUG or galactose-based sonocystography to obtain the diagnosis. DMSA scintigram was used to evaluate renal damage. Data about gender, age, UTI, bilateralism, renal damage, voiding dysfunction, outcomes, complications, and recurrences were registered. A new factor was defined: ureteral dilation independent from the international classification. This factor was evaluated by a single pediatric urologist blinded for the international classification results. Data analysis was performed using the chi square test and Fischer exact test; a multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed. Statistical significance was established at p < 0.05. SPSS 11.0 software was employed for data analysis. Boys/girls ratio was 2.91. Bilateral VUR appeared in 44.4% of the cases. UTI was the presenting diagnosis in 64 cases; the diagnosis was prenatal in 21 cases (with a male predominance 5.2:1). We found a strong correlation between renal scarring at the time of diagnosis and voiding dysfunction (p< 0.01). Cure rate after first injection was 64%. Although univariate analysis showed a strong correlation between cure and first injection, biloterality, voiding dysfunction, initial nephropathy, and ureteral dilation grade, on multivariate logistic regression the only significant factor to predict treatment response was the existence of severe ureteral dilation in comparison with mild dilation (p < 0.001; odds ratio 0.045, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.16). Renal damage progression was specially detected in those patients with voiding dysfunction (p = 0.053), bilaterality (p = 0.034) and severe ureteral dilation (p < 0.001). A direct relation between cure rate after endoscopic treatment of grade III and IV reflux and severity of ureteral dilation was demonstrated. Other relevant factors implied in the endoscopic resolution of VUR include the existence of voiding dysfunction, bilateral reflux and renal damage determined by DMSA at the time of initial diagnosis. Gender, age, and number of infections during follow up have no influence in the probability of cure of grade III and IV VU reflux treated with subureteral injection of biocompatible substances."}

A prospective study was performed in a fifteen years period between 1988 and 2003 in paediatric patients with a solitary kidney, in a Children's Hospital. All the following parameters were evaluated every year: age, sex, ethiology, elapsed time since the concept of solitary kidney was assessed (ET), blood pressure, renal function measured by GFR, urinary excretion of solutes, concentration ability and microalbuminuria (MA). DMSA was made at the beginning and every five years and renal ultrasonography was carried out every two years. Two groups were made depending of nephrourologic malformations in the remanent kidney and/or antecedents of pyelonephritis: Group I with antecedents of pyelonephritis and/or malformations; Group II, nor antecedents of pyelonephritis neither malformations. Ninety five patients were evaluated, 69% (n = 66) were males and 31% (n = 29) were females, with an age at diagnosis of 3.5 yr (ranged 0.1-17 yrs). ET was 9.2 yrs (range 1-20 yrs). The ethiology was: Nephrectomy of the contralateral kidney 39 patients (pts) (41%), renal agenesis (RA) 47 pts (49%) and nonfunctioning multicystic displastic kidney (MCDK) 9 pts (9.4%). Functional alterations were found in 18 pts (19%), such as MA in 12 pts (12.6%), decreased GRF in 5 pts (5.5%) and hypertension in 3 pts (3.2%). It was observed more significant functional alterations in the patients of the Group I (58%) versus Group II (9%) (p < 0.001). There was in Group II a significant correlation between kidney size and GFR (p < 0.01, r = 0.3), and between kidney size and ET (P < 0.05; r = 0.3). Any alteration in the renal function was observed in the 12.6% of the children. The most frequent affected parameter of renal damage was MA, followed by GFR reduction.

Traditionally it has been used as an adjunctive test for inflammation and as a marker of disease activity. Though sensitive, its nonspecific nature imposes limitation on its clinical use. Currently C-reactive protein is used in the management of chorioamnionitis, preterm premature rupture of membranes, pelvic inflammatory disease, and urinary tract infection. Interestingly, several obstetric conditions such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes are now known to have an underlying inflammatory basis and there is an emerging role of C-reactive protein testing in managing these diseases. Additionally C-reactive protein testing has an established place in management of several acute abdominal conditions.

(99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed in 343 children with culture documented UTI (247 girls and 96 boys) aged from three months to 14 years (middle age of 4.82 years). The children studied were all those submitted for renal scintiscan to the Institute of Nuclear Medicine, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade during a five-year period (2000-2004). Micturating cystoureterography (MCU) performed in all patients before (99m)Tc-DMSA scan, revealed VUR in 213 children, while in 130 children VUR was not detected by MCU. In 15 of the 213 children the grade of VUR was I, in 88 was II, in 57 was III, in 33 was IV and 20 children had grade V of VUR. Findings of (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy were classified as: normal, equivocal and abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed using c(2)test. In all patients abnormal findings were detected in 38% (131/343), normal in 51% (174/343) and equivocal findings in 11% (38/343). In children with UTI and VUR the incidence of abnormal findings was 53% (112/213), of normal 37% (80/213) and of equivocal findings 10% (21/213). In children with UTI without VUR the incidence of abnormal findings was 15% (19/130), of normal findings 72% (94/130), and of equivocal findings 13% (17/130). The incidence of abnormal findings was significantly higher in children with UTI and VUR than in those with UTI without VUR (P<0.001). In children with VUR grades I, II, III, IV and V abnormal findings were 33%, 32%, 60%, 79% and 95% respectively. The incidence of abnormal findings was higher in children with VUR grades IV and V, than in grade I and II (P<0.001). Our results suggest that (99m)Tc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in children can discriminate between grade I-II and IV-V of VUR and also that in children with UTI and VUR abnormal findings in the scintiscan were more than three times higher than in children with UTI alone."}

Fifteen of them (14.2%) had acute alcoholic hepatitis on cirrhotic background (group A), 20 (18.9%) had alcoholic cirrhosis without hepatitis and/or bacterial infection (group B), 16 (15.1%) had decompensated cirrhosis with proved bacterial infection (group C), 42 (39.6%) had uncomplicated viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis (group D) and 13 (12.3%) had acute icteric viral hepatitis (group E). Serum procalcitonin levels were measured using an immunoluminometric assay. Statistical analysis was based on Student's t-test and the non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test (P<0.05). Serum procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients with bacterial infection (9.80+/-16.80 ng/ml) than in those without bacterial infection (0.21+/-0.13 ng/ml, P=0.001), whereas they were within normal range (<0.5 ng/ml) in all patients with uncomplicated cirrhosis, irrespective of the cause of cirrhosis. Seven of 15 group A patients (46.2%) and 4/13 group E patients (30.8%), all of them cirrhotics, had procalcitonin levels higher than 0.5 ng/ml on admission, without established bacterial infection. Serum procalcitonin levels remain below the threshold of 0.5 ng/ml in all patients with uncomplicated cirrhosis, irrespective of the cause of the disease, while they are significantly elevated when bacterial infection complicates the course of the disease. A significant proportion of patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis on a cirrhotic background as well as of patients with acute on chronic viral hepatitis, without bacterial infection, exhibit serum procalcitonin levels above 0.5 ng/ml, suggesting that this cut-off value is probably not enough to discriminate between patients with or without bacterial infection within these subgroups of patients with liver disease."}

The evaluation and management of urinary tract infections in infants and children is undergoing changes due to the impact of evidence-based studies and new technology. The uncircumcised male infant is at increased risk for a urinary tract infection, but there is marked difference in the frequency of circumcision carried out to lower the risk of infection in the United States compared with Europe. Commentaries presenting different interpretations of the current data make for interesting reading and present the many sides of this issue. Vesicoureteric reflux, previously viewed as the major risk factor for acquired renal damage, now shares this role with nonreflux nephropathy. Procalcitonin has been evaluated as a biochemical tool to identify patients at risk for kidney damage, with dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy as the reference method to detect renal scarring. The previously accepted concept that vesicoureteric reflux as detected radiologically is almost always the key factor in acquired renal injury secondary to a urinary tract infection is no longer accepted. Current studies show that nonreflux nephropathy occurs as often as reflux nephropathy. There is now a question of the value of imaging studies designed to identify vesicoureteric reflux and of the use of suppressive antibiotics for vesicoureteric reflux. There exist useful evidence-based studies for antibiotic therapy for upper and lower tract urinary tract infections, but no such data are available for guidance in selecting imaging studies for the infant or child with a first febrile urinary tract infection."}

Resolution of reflux occurred in 2 of 11 (18%) patients with high-grade VUR and in 29 of 32 (90.6%) patients with low-grade VUR at age 2 years (P < .001). At age 2 years, 91% of the low-grade refluxing kidneys were normal on US, compared with only 35% of the high-grade refluxing kidneys. Split renal function was within normal range and single-kidney GFR was significantly increased in 13 of the 17 high-grade refluxing kidneys during follow-up. Furthermore, a strong association between dysplasia on US and poor renal function outcome was found. In most infants with VUR, the reflux is of low grade and resolves rapidly. In those children with high-grade VUR, spontaneous resolution is rare at age 2 years, but persistent reflux rarely impairs the maturation of renal function."}

We report a case of metastatic prostate cancer occurred in a 53-year-old HIV-infected man, admitted due to non-specific signs, and symptoms: impaired general conditions, fever, weight loss, fatigue, and exertional dyspnea. A remarkable anemia and an aortic systolic murmur were the prominent initial findings, while AIDS-related conditions were not suspected due to a sustained CD4+ count and a contained viremia, which never required antiretroviral therapy. Repeated red blood cell transfusions and an empiric, combined antimicrobial therapy were promptly carried out, under the suspicion of infectious endocarditis, but no appreciable improvement of clinical conditions was achieved. Subsequently, our patient complained not only of an increasingly severe pain at the root of his left thigh, together with overcoming dysuria and urgency, but also urinary tract infection that was rapidly ruled out. During the diagnostic workup for an HIV-associated fever of undetermined origin, a bone marrow biopsy disclosed a metastatic prostatic cancer, with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and acid phosphate levels. An abdominal-pelvic ultrasonography and computerized tomographic scan allowed to detect a dyshomogeneous endopelvic expansive mass with extrinsic compression of the urinary bladder, and involvement of the last lumbar vertebra, large portions of pelvis, and the proximal epiphysis of the right femur. A skeleton scintigraphy pointed out multiple hypercaptation (areas of concentrated traces of radioactivity) areas with involvement of cranial, cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae, as well as the pelvis and upper portions of both femurs. Despite therapeutic attempts, our patient deceased after seven weeks due to an overwhelming disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The non-specific clinical presentation of our case (mimicking other generalized or focal illnesses), and the final, lethal complication (DIC) pose striking problems related to the differential diagnosis during HIV disease, while the rapid evolution into an advanced, complicated, and widely metastatic disease with extensive bone marrow invasion which preceded the appearance of local signs-symptoms, and the lethal overwhelming DIC, deserves attention by specialists who care for HIV-infected subjects."}

{"id": "16356794", "title": "Pediatric applications of renal nuclear medicine.", "content": "Pediatric applications of renal nuclear medicine. This review should be regarded as an opinion based on personal experience, clinical and experimental studies, and many discussions with colleagues. It covers the main radionuclide procedures for nephro-urological diseases in children. Glomerular filtration rate can be accurately determined using simplified 2- or 1-blood sample plasma clearance methods. Minor controversies related to the technical aspects of these methods concern principally some correction factors, the quality control, and the normal values in children. However, the main problem is the reluctance of the clinician to apply these methods, despite the accuracy and precision that are higher than with the traditional chemical methods. Interesting indications are early detection of renal impairment, hyperfiltration status, and monitoring of nephrotoxic drugs. Cortical scintigraphy is accepted as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of regional lesions. It accurately reflects the histological changes, and the interobserver reproducibility in reporting is high. Potential technical pitfalls should be recognized, such as the normal variants and the difficulty in differentiating acute lesions from permanent ones or acquired lesions from congenital ones. Although dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy seems to play a minor role in the traditional approach to urinary tract infection, recent studies suggest that this examination might influence the treatment of the acute phase, the indication for chemoprophylaxis and micturating cystography, and the duration of follow-up. New technical developments have been applied recently to the renogram: tracers more appropriate to the young child, early injection of furosemide, late postmicturition and gravity-assisted images and, finally, more objective parameters of renal drainage. Pitfalls mainly are related to the interpretation of drainage on images and curves. Dilated uropathies represent the main indication of the renogram, but the impact of this technique on the management of the child is, in a great number of cases, still a matter of intense controversy. Direct and indirect radionuclide cystography are interesting alternatives to the radiograph technique and should be integrated into the process of diagnosis and follow-up of vesicoureteral reflux."}

The purpose of this study was to report the clinical course of medium-long-term follow-up of children with prenatally detected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Between 1986 and 2004, 53 (41 males) children with VUR detected by investigation of prenatal hydronephrosis were followed up for a mean time of 66 months (range: 6-200 months). Newborns were investigated by ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and DMSA scan. Follow-up clinical visits were performed at 6-month intervals. After 24 months patients were investigated by conventional VCUG or direct isotope cystogram. Survival analysis was performed in order to evaluate the resolution of the reflux. Differences between subgroups (mild vs moderate/severe reflux) were assessed by the two-sided log rank test. Thirty (58%) infants presented bilateral VUR, for a total of 83 renal units. There was a predominance of severe reflux (54%). Renal damage was detected in 33.7% of the units on first renal scan. There was a significant correlation between severe reflux and renal damage scars (RR=3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8, p=0.002). Forty-seven patients were treated with continuous prophylaxis. One patient developed systolic hypertension. Urinary tract infection occurred in 12 (25%) children conservatively managed. VUR resolution was evaluated in 56 renal units. Spontaneous resolution was observed in 25 units (45%). At 48 months after diagnosis, 75% of the cases of mild reflux (I-III) and 37% of severe reflux (IV-V) had resolved (log-rank, 5.6, p=0.017). There was an improvement of nutritional parameters between admission and the end of follow-up. In conclusion, the clinical course of prenatally detected VUR followed up on a medium-long-term basis is relatively benign. Our study corroborates the results obtained in other series of infants with reflux that emphasized the heterogeneity of this disorder."}

Patients undergoing re-operative surgery following prior Stamey endoscopic bladder neck suspension were selected from a surgical database. Four women with lower urinary tract and/or vaginal symptoms following prior Stamey endoscopic bladder neck suspension were identified. All patients had undergone removal of the bolster material by a single surgeon (ESR) at re-operation. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative inpatient and outpatient records were reviewed. Patients presented with a variety of symptoms including urinary incontinence, recurrent cystitis, vaginitis, and urinary frequency at 9, 11, 11, and 12 years after Stamey bladder neck suspension. In addition, two patients presented with recurrent, intermittent bloody vaginal discharge and two patients complained of recurrent urinary tract infections and irritative voiding symptoms. All patients underwent transvaginal excision of the Dacron bolster. Three patients also underwent placement of an autologous pubovaginal sling for symptomatic recurrent stress urinary incontinence. At a mean follow-up of 30 months all four patients were improved. There was no recurrence of vaginal discharge or urinary tract infections. Irritative voiding symptoms resolved. Delayed complications from surgically implanted synthetic materials can present many years after initial implantation. The clinical findings are often subtle and require a high degree of suspicion. Vaginal discharge and irritative urinary symptoms in patients with even a remote history of Stamey bladder neck suspension should prompt a thorough vaginal exam and cystoscopy. Excision of the bolsters can be performed and is usually followed by symptomatic improvement."}

This rule combines clinical (family history of uropathology, male gender, young age), biological (raised C reactive protein), and radiological (urinary tract dilation on renal ultrasound) predictors in a score, and provides 100% sensitivity. A retrospective hospital based cohort study included all children, 1 month to 4 years old, with a first febrile urinary tract infection. The sensitivities and specificities of the rule at the two previously proposed score thresholds (< or =0 and < or =5) to predict respectively, all-grade or grade > or =3 VUR, were calculated.

Some methodological weaknesses explain this lack of reproducibility. The reproducibility of the previously proposed decision rule was poor and its potential contribution to clinical management of children with febrile urinary tract infection seems to be modest."}

We report an anti-GBM antibody-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis patient who benefitted from maintenance hemodialysis 4 months after the initial treatment, which included steroid pulse therapy and plasma exchange. A-29-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of high fever, abnormal urinary findings (leukocytes 3+, protein 2+, occult blood 3+) and a moderate degree of azotemia(S-Cr 2.9 mg/dl). C-reactive protein (CRP) was 18.9 mg/dl and antibiotics were administered intravenously for 7 days under the diagnosis of pyelonephritis. High fever persisted, however, and S-Cr increased to 9.2 mg/dl even though a sufficient volume of urine was maintained. Blood and urine cultures were negative for bacteria. A kidney biopsy was performed and cellular crescents were observed around the glomeruli. No abnormal finding was observed in the lung and the nasopharyngeal region. To treat the crescentic glomerulonephritis, steroid and cyclophosphamide were administered while hemodialysis was carried out simultaneously. Although P-ANCA and C-ANCA were negative, anti-GBM antibody was proven to be positive thereafter (169 U) and six sessions of plasmapheresis were additionally performed to remove the antibody. Two months after the last plasmapheresis, the reduced urine volume (300 ml/day) gradually returned to normal. Hemodialysis was terminated because the S-Cr concentration reached a plateau at 4 mg/dl. Repeated biopsy revealed marked glomerulosclerosis, hence hypertension treatment and a low protein diet were ordered. In conclusion, residual renal function might improve even after 4 months of hemodialysis in cases of intensively treated anti-GBM-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis, though consecutive renoprotective therapy is required."}

A 69-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia at 66 years of age, was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, purpura occurring on her arms and legs, and renal dysfunction. At the time of admission, her renal function had severely deteriorated (sCr 8.2 mg/dl, 24 h Ccr 6 ml/min), she had a severe high fever (BT 39.5 degrees C), back pain, a white blood cell count of 19,540/,microl, and a CRP level of 26.7 mg/dl. Blood and urine cultures yielded identical strains of E. coli. We diagnosed sepsis caused by pyelonephritis, and started intravenous meropenem trihydrate(MEPM) at 0.5 g/day. Her renal dysfunction was severe, so we started hemodialysis therapy. Immunological examination revealed the presence of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. Renal biopsy before steroid therapy confirmed the diagnosis of pauci-immune-type crescentic glomerulonephritis. Based on purpura and interstitial pneumonia, along with rapidly MPO-ANCA-positive progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with acute renal failure, we diagnosed microscopic polyangitis (MPA). To treat sepsis and severe pyelonephritis, we started intravenous immunoglobulin 5 g (100 mg/kg)/day for 5 days before starting immunosuppressive steroid therapy (m-PSL 1 g/day, PSL 20 mg/day) for 3 days. These treatments improved her general condition and immediately improved her renal function. It is important to prevent infection during treatment using conventional immunosuppressive therapy. These findings suggest immunoglobulin therapy to be a safe immuno-suppressive treatment that is efficacious against ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis."}

Viral and bacterial infections may serve as an environmental trigger for the development or exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the genetically predetermined individual. In addition, SLE patients are more prone to develop common (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, sepsis), chronic (tuberculosis), and opportunistic infections possibly due to inherit genetic and immunologic defects (complement deficiencies, mannose-binding lectin [MBL] polymorphisms, elevated Fcgamma III and GM-CSF levels, osteopontion polymorphism), but also due to the broad spectrum immunosuppressive agents that are part of therapy for severe manifestations of the disease. Hence, SLE patients are considered a high-risk population, where identification and treatment of chronic infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus, are important prior to the institution of immunosuppression so as to prevent reactivation or exacerbation of the infection. Infections in SLE patients remain a source of morbidity and mortality. A caveat often encountered is to distinguish between a lupus flare and an acute infection; in such cases parameters including elevated CRP (and adhesion molecules) may aid in the diagnosis of infection. Recent research has provided convincing evidence that EBV infection may play a major role not only in molecular mimicry but also in aberrations of B cells and apoptosis leading to a state of perpetual heightened immune response in SLE."}

{"id": "16356021", "title": "Controversies in the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in children.", "content": "Controversies in the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections in children. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common childhood bacterial infections, after upper respiratory tract and middle ear infections. The current goal of management is to prevent detrimental effects of UTI by early detection and treatment. Recommendations for the imaging of children depend upon age at presentation and sex. All children aged <5 years who have had a febrile UTI require a radiologic evaluation to identify any underlying genitourinary pathology. Older children can undergo a more tailored work-up depending on whether there is a febrile UTI or cystitis-type symptoms. Dysfunctional voiding and urge syndrome significantly increase the risk of developing UTIs in children. Vesicoureteral reflux can increase the risk of pyelonephritis and renal scarring in children with UTIs. For the most part, pyelonephritis can be diagnosed on clinical grounds in the majority of patients and a subsequent (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan can be reserved to identify post-nephritic renal scarring. When renal scarring is identified, the child and parents need to be educated regarding the possibility of hypertension, proteinuria, progressive nephropathy, and the risk of complications in future pregnancies. Treatment of UTI is started in the unwell child before the culture results are available and subsequently changed to culture-specific antimicrobial therapy. A short course of treatment is required for acute uncomplicated UTIs. A child with acute pyelonephritis requires 10-14 days of antibacterial treatment. The oral route in young children often causes vomiting, which implies therapeutic delay, a well known risk factor for scarring."}

This study assessed the reliability of ultrasound in identifying reflux nephropathy in children with acute pyelonephritis with or without vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Eighty children (45 female and 35 male, age range 5 months to 10 years, average age 2 years 1 month) with a positive history for at least one episode of APN participated in this study. All children underwent voiding cystourethrography, DMSA scintigraphy 4 to 8 months after the most recent episode of APN, and an ultrasound test evaluation less than 2 months after DMSA scintigraphy. Voiding cystourethrograms showed VUR in 52 children (68%); 13 of these were bilateral, for a total of 65 refluxing kidney units of the 154 (42%) evaluated; DMSA scintigram was normal for 108 of 154 kidneys (70%). Of the 65 kidneys with VUR, DMSA scintigram displayed normal findings in 29 cases (45%) and pathologic findings in 36 (55%). In the 79 nonrefluxing kidneys, DMSA scintigram was normal in 69 cases (87%). The relative risk of scarring in VUR kidneys is 2.6. The ultrasound study recorded a maximum longitudinal diameter between the 5th and 95th percentiles in 80 of 89 (81%) kidneys without VUR and in 21 of 65 (32%) with VUR. A significant correlation was found between maximum longitudinal diameters and DMSA scintigraphic findings in kidneys with VUR and those without VUR, respectively. This study establishes that ultrasound scans, by means of a simple and reproducible measurement technique, maximum longitudinal diameter, have a predictive value with regard to the presence of scars, with few exceptions. This finding, in our opinion, could lead to a decrease in the number of invasive procedures, in particular DMSA scan, in patients with APN."}

GFR was evaluated from Cr-EDTA plasma clearance using blood samples taken at 2, 3 and 4 h according to the methods set out in the BNMS GFR guidelines. 99mTc-DMSA images were reviewed to identify children with normal scans. Of the 45 children having a combined 99mTc-DMSA and GFR investigation, 27 (12 females, 15 males) had a normal scan result. The mean GFR (standard deviation) in the 24 subjects aged 2-17 years was 109.5 (16.8) ml . min(-1) . (1.73 m2)(-1). This compared with a predicted figure of 107.0 (17.0) ml . min(-1) . (1.73 m2)(-1) when the paediatric reference range published by Piepsz et al. was adjusted to be consistent with the BNMS GFR guidelines. When the GFR results in the present study were calculated according to the single-sample and two-sample methods used by Piepsz et al., there was close agreement with the results obtained in the latter study [116.7 (24.2) vs. 114.7 (25.8) ml . min(-1) . (1.73 m2)(-1)]. Children with abnormal 99mTc-DMSA scans had significantly lower GFR than those with normal scans (P=0.003). There is a consistent difference between the GFR results in children with normal 99mTc-DMSA scans obtained in the present study and the unadjusted results of Piepsz et al. that can be explained by the different methods of calculating GFR in the two studies. Given the larger number of children in the latter study, it is proposed that centres evaluating GFR according to the BNMS method should adopt the Piepsz et al. reference range adjusted for consistency with the BNMS guidelines. This gives a mean GFR (SD) in children of 2 years and over of 107 (17) ml . min(-1) . (1.73 m2)(-1)."}

The contribution of different imaging techniques to clinical management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of different techniques in the diagnostic workup of children with negative prenatal ultrasonogram, referred for urinary tract infection (UTI) within the first 24 months. One-hundred and forty-seven patients, 71 males/76 females were studied. All patients were submitted to renal ultrasonogram (RUS) and to micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) independently from the results of RUS. In a small group (48 children) DMSA scan was performed independently from the results of RUS and MCU. Sensitivity and predictive value of RUS for vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) were estimated. Multiple regression analysis was performed on a selected number of signs to evaluate their predictive value. The group investigated by DMSA scan was analysed to evaluate how the presence of VUR on MCU anticipated renal damage. Nineteen (21%) patients with normal RUS, had VUR. Predictive value of RUS (0.21) was influenced by the grade of the VUR but more than 30% of high grade refluxing renal units appeared normal at initial ultrasonography. DMSA scan was abnormal in 27% of 48 patients; its result was independent from the presence of VUR of whatever grade. The increasing number of renal abnormalities detected before birth reduces the possibility of late abnormal RUS findings. It makes RUS screening for abnormalities, after a first episode of UTI, scarcely useful. VUR may be easily missed when RUS resulted normal and MCU is omitted. Negative MCU cannot exclude renal damage in presence of UTI. Renal defects at DMSA scan may be unrelated to a demonstrable VUR and could have a different pathogenesis."}

However its implication in the modern management for pediatric UTI remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of secretor status on clinical course in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). From 1998 to 2002, 382 cases of primary VUR presented to our institute and were treated either surgically or nonoperatively in accordance with the American Urological Association guideline. Of these potential candidates 128 patients and their guardians volunteered to be entered into the study. Antiseptic swabs to collect saliva were sent to them. The secretor status was determined using the hemagglutination inhibition assay from the eluted saliva on the swabs and medical records of responders were evaluated retrospectively. Secretor status was not associated with gender, VUR grade, presentation, history of breakthrough UTI, laterality of VUR and conservative vs surgical treatment. However, nonsecretor status weakly correlated with decreased split renal function and significantly correlated with the presence of focal renal scarring (40.9% vs 21.7% for children with and without scarring, respectively) as determined by technetium dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan. These results demonstrate that secretor status represents unrecognized host disposition that affects the clinical course of primary VUR. Further study is needed to determine the significance of secretor status for clinical management and pathophysiology of VUR."}

Both the upper and lower urinary tract may be affected. Diseases of the urinary tract can cause an intrinsic obstruction. Sometimes tumours may cause a compression and as secondary effect an obstruction (extrinsic). Ultrasound is the key diagnostic tool and shows dilatation of the obstructed urinary tract. But for the functional exploration of babies and toddlers, renal scanning and X-ray examinations are necessary. These examinations lead to an exposure to radiation which necessitates careful indication. Some of the congenital diseases (for example ureteropelvic junction obstruction, megaureter) show a maturation without any intervention. So one has to decide whether to wait and see or to operate. A percutaneous nephrostomy or a DJ-catheter is not often used in the treatment of obstruction in general. These forms of drainage are more often used in the treatment of stones or of extrinsic obstruction. A pyelocutaneostomy or ureterocutaneostomy is a special surgical procedure in pediatric urology for transient drainage of the upper urinary tract (megaureter). The operation of a seriously ill new-born should be done in a centre for pediatric urology and pediatric nephrology. When the upper urinary tract is dilated, patients may need an antibiotic prophylaxis, because the dilatation of the upper urinary tract increases the risk of urinary tract infections (UTI). The indication for antibiotic prophylaxis should by guided by the criteria of the APN-Consensus Paper. Long-term follow-up is necessary and should comprise ultrasound, physical examination, controlling the blood pressure, urine analysis and blood tests. The aims of diagnostics, treatment and long-term follow-up are the preservation of renal function and to protect the children from UTI. This goal must be reached under conditions that are appropriate for children and their parents."}

The polymorphisms were investigated by polymerase chain reaction in 97 children (81 females, 16 males; age, 2.5-13 years) with recurrent urinary tract infection and 100 healthy controls as a single centre study. Children with vesicoureteral reflux, bladder dysfunction and other uropathies were excluded. The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan performed at least 3 months after a proven urinary tract infection and the result of the last DMSA was taken into consideration. Renal scarring was found in 30 patients (30.9%) using DMSA scan. The number of urinary tract infection attacks was significantly higher in patients with renal scarring compared with children without scarring (P<0.05). The follow-up period and male/female ratio of patients with or without renal scarring was similar (P>0.05). Age at the first urinary tract infection was lower in the group with scarring. The ACE insertion/deletion genotype distribution and D allele frequency were similar between patients and controls (P>0.05), and in patients with renal scarring and those without renal scarring. Also, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphism was not associated with renal parenchymal damage (P>0.05).

Diagnosing infantile urinary tract infection (UTI) is difficult due to contamination during urine collection. Catheterization is convenient but diagnostic criteria (colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/mL)) is controversial, especially in uncircumcised males. To study the value of catheter urine cultures in terms of likelihood ratios (LRs), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of different CFU/mL in uncircumcised boys and girls. Infants aged 1-18 months who had catheter urine cultures from July 1999 to June 2002 were reviewed to decide if they had symptomatic UTI (group A) or not (group B). Urinary tract infection was confirmed if patients had a positive urine culture plus acute fever, pyuria, positive leucocyte esterase and nitrite tests and good response to antibiotics, with pyelonephritic evidence on early dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans in doubtful cases. Group B included infants with negative urine culture results, and those with positive results but were asymptomatic and admitted for micturating cystourethrogram. Nine hundred and fifty-two patients were studied (492 boys, 460 girls; 212 in group A, 740 in group B). No single cut-off CFU/mL has high sensitivity and specificity to simultaneously diagnose and exclude UTI. The CFU counts of 100-10(3), 10(3)-10(4), 10(4)-10(5) and >10(5) were associated with LRs of 0.11, 0.45, 1.52 and 20.5, respectively in uncircumcised boys, and with LRs of 1.39, 2.49, 8.95 and 18.8, respectively in girls. The LR for mixed growths was 0.21. Unlike suprapubic tap urine, catheter urine culture has to be interpreted against the clinical context or pretest probability and in terms of probability. In the scenario of a febrile infant where the pretest probability of UTI was about 5%, UTI was highly likely if counts exceeded 10(5)/mL, and unlikely if counts were below 10(4)/mL in uncircumcised boys. In female infants, UTI was highly likely if counts were >10(4) CFU/mL, but lower counts could not exclude UTI."}

This study included 42 children with positive urine culture and 26 children with negative urine culture who had supportive evidence of UTI as determined by the predetermined criteria and diagnosed to have APN by DMSA. All of them had ultrasonogram (USG), DMSA and voiding cystourethrogram (VCU). They were followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. Out of the 42 children with positive urine culture 92.9% had features of APN in the DMSA of whom 82.1% had vesicoureteric relux (VUR).

Ultrasound suggestive of parenchymal change was observed in 47.6% in the culture positive group and 65.4% in the culture negative group. In conclusion, it is suggested, that DMSA is a useful investigation for the diagnosis of APN in febrile UTI. DMSA is indicated in febrile children with negative urine culture but with supportive evidence of UTI and in FUO. An abnormal DMSA is a strong indication for work up for VUR."}

It is generally believed that infants are more susceptible to development of renal scarring after pyelonephritis than children over 5 years old. This view has led to differences in investigations and treatment according to age. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the occurrence of renal parenchymal lesion in children over 5 years admitted with a first-time symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). Between October 2000 and April 2002, 52 children aged over 5 years who were admitted to our department with probable acute pyelonephritis (APN) and a positive urine culture were included in this study. All children received antibiotics for 14 days. During the acute phase of infection, scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and ultrasonography (US) were done. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was performed in all children early in the course of the illness, generally within 5-7 days of hospitalization. When scintigraphy showed renal parenchymal changes, repeat scintigraphy was done after at least 3 months to assess the progression of renal abnormalities. Of the 52 children with a first-time documented pyelonephritis, cortical scintigraphy showed renal lesion in 41 children (78.8%). US was normal in all children with normal renal scintigraphy, while it detected renal abnormalities in 16 of the 41 (39 %) with abnormal scintigraphy (p <0.0001). Topographic analysis of the 165 focal lesions showed that 42.4% were localized to the upper poles, 17.5% to the middle third, and 40% to the lower poles of the kidneys. Repeat scintigraphy showed persistent lesions corresponding to those on the initial scan in nine (28.2%) of the 32 children. Renal lesions had partly regressed in 23 (71.8%) of the patients who underwent repeat scintigraphy. Vesicoureteral reflux was observed in 13.4% of kidneys and renal parenchymal abnormalities were identified in 71.4% and 72.2% of renal units, respectively, with and without reflux ( p >0.05). In conclusion, our data did not confirm the conventional opinion that the risk of renal scarring after pyelonephritis is low in children over the age of 5 years. Our findings suggest that renal scintigraphy may be a more appropriate method of investigation than VCUG for evaluation of the children over 5 years with acute pyelonephritis. Additionally, the frequency of scintigraphic changes is high, and a strategy based exclusively on ultrasound findings would miss about 61% of the abnormal renal units. We recommend that all children, irrespective of age, will benefit from further investigations that might prevent or limit the development of scarring process and renal complications."}

Also, significantly higher serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) levels were detected in those with acute pyelonephritis than those with lower UTI (p <0.001).

Imaging in childhood urinary tract infection (UTI) is still a matter of debate. There are established guidelines, however new knowledge and the changed medical environment have enhanced this ongoing discussion. These new insights have impacted therapy and consequently the imaging algorithm. Modern imaging methods -- particularly MRI and modern ultrasound (US) -- are less invasive with a lower radiation burden. Additionally, it has been shown that VUR is a poor predictor for renal scarring out, which affects long-term results. Furthermore, the majority of UT malformations is depicted by prenatal US. The most crucial aspect of improving long-term outcome appears to be the early and reliable depiction of UTI and effective treatment to prevent renal scarring. This review tries to present this new knowledge and to discuss the potential of modern imaging. Recent changes in imaging algorithms are highlighted and an outcome-oriented algorithm that addresses these recent developments is proposed, without lightly abandoning established standards. It consists of an orienting US and -- for depiction of renal involvement -- amplitude coded color Doppler sonography or renal static scintigraphy (considered the gold standard, particularly for evaluating scars); in future MRI may play a role. Based on this concept, only patients with renal damage as well as patients with complex urinary tract malformations or intractable recurrent UTI may have to undergo VCUG."}

Negative and positive likelihood ratios for CRP (>50 mg/l), PCT (>2 ng/l), white blood cells (>15 x 10(5)/l) and McCarthy's score (<9) were 0.36/2.4, 0.58/3.5, 0.94/1.1 and 0.19/2.7, respectively. A combination of PCT, CRP and WBC generated a positive likelihood ratio of 10.6, changing the post-test probability to 54%. For early diagnosis of SBI in children presenting with fever and no focus of infection, the diagnostic utility of procalcitonin is similar to the traditional markers infection and clinical scoring. While a low procalcitonin level cannot be used to exclude SBI in this population, a combination of PCT, CRP and WBC may be more useful in predicting SBI."}

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of renal scarring in a group of Kuwaiti Arab children with their first documented acute pyelonephritis (APN). Eighty-two Kuwaiti Arab children (10 males and 72 females) who had abnormal (99m)Tc DMSA renal scan findings of acute pyelonephritis were prospectively studied with the same imaging modality 6 months after treatment to identify those who developed renal scarring. A micturition cystourethrogram (MCUG) was performed for all of the children 1 month after diagnosis. Children were divided into 3 age groups (<2 years, 2-5 years and above 5 years). The follow-up DMSA renal scans 6 months after diagnosis revealed normalization of renal changes in 56% (46 patients), much improvement with residual renal abnormality in 6% (5 patients), and persistent parenchymal defects in 38% (31 patients). Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 32% of children (26/82) and the majority were between grade I and III. Thirteen of those with VUR (50%) developed renal scars on follow-up. Fifty-three percent of the scarred kidneys (19/36) were drained by non-refluxing ureters. In this study, children older than 2 years had less VUR yet were more susceptible to APN and to the development of renal scars. Girls were more prone to developing APN and renal scarring than boys. This work shows that APN is a serious cause for renal scarring in our patients, particularly if associated with other risk factors such as recurrent infections and the female sex."}

To define the role of cystography following a first UTI in children aged under 1 year, when urinary tract ultrasonography (US) is normal. Retrospective data collection of 108 children (216 renal units) aged under 1 year at the time of a bacteriologically proven UTI. All had a normal US and underwent both catheter cystogram and DMSA test. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios positive and negative, and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated for VUR on cystography versus scarring on DMSA. VUR was shown in 25 (11.6%) renal units. Scarring on DMSA was seen in 8 (3.7 %) kidneys. Only 16% of kidneys with VUR had associated scarring; 50% of scarred kidneys were not associated with VUR. The likelihood ratio positive was 4.95 (95% CI 2.22 to 11.05) and the likelihood ratio negative was 0.56 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.11). The diagnostic odds ratio was 8.9, suggesting that cystography provided little additional information. Since only 16% of children with VUR had an abnormal kidney, the presence of VUR does not identify a susceptible population with an abnormal kidney on DMSA. In the context of a normal ultrasound examination, cystography contributes little to the management of children under the age of 1 year with a UTI. In this context, a normal DMSA study reinforces the redundancy of cystography."}

A first febrile urinary tract infection leads to the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in 20% to 40% of children. Systematic voiding cystourethrography then is recommended. However, for 60% to 80% of the children, voiding cystourethrography is a posteriori normal. Moreover, it is irradiating, painful, and expensive. Thus, selective approaches are needed. Because procalcitonin has been shown to be associated with severe pyelonephritis and renal scars, which are correlated to vesicoureteral reflux, we analyzed its relationship with vesicoureteral reflux. A retrospective hospital-based cohort study included all children who were 1 month to 4 years of age and had a first febrile urinary tract infection. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Among 136 patients included, 25% had vesicoureteral reflux. The median procalcitonin concentration was significantly higher in children with reflux than in those without (1.2 vs 0.6 ng/mL). High procalcitonin (> or =0.5 ng/mL) was associated with reflux (odds ratio [OR]: 4.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-16.2). After logistic-regression adjustment for all potential confounders, the association remained significant (OR: 4.9; 95% CI: 1.7-14.0). The relationship was stronger for high-grade (> or =3) reflux (OR: 8.7; 95% CI: 1.2-382) than low-grade reflux (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.1-15.3).

Extra-renal pelvis (ERpel) is a common ultrasonographic finding among neonates who have undergone recurrent ultrasound examinations for a better definition of prenatal renal pelvic dilatation. This study tries to determine whether or not ERpel has important prognostic implications. Seventy-nine neonates (17 female) were examined. All had a diagnosis of prenatal renal pelvis dilatation, which was shown by postnatal ultrasound to be ERpel. Sixty ERpel neonates were examined 1.5 months to 2.5 months after the ultrasound (US) diagnosis by both Tc-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DPTA) dynamic renal scanning and (99m)Tc-pertechnetate direct cystography. Clinical assessment, urine cultures and renal ultrasound follow-up were maintained for 2 years. The proportion of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients with ERpel was compared with that of the total neonatal and infantile population with normal US scans in the region of our hospital. Associated minor congenital malformations were found in 12 of 79 neonates (15.2%). Four had a family history of ERpel. Among 60 neonates who underwent renal scanning, 36 (60%) were found to have urinary retention in the collecting system. Another nine (15%) had vesico-ureteral (VU) reflux, of which seven had urinary retention. Fifteen (25%) showed normal isotope imaging. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed in 16 ERpel neonates in whom only one exhibited VU reflux (grade 2). The incidence of neonatal UTI in the ERpel group was more than that of either neonatal or infantile UTI in those with normal US scans in the local population (20.2% vs 1.2% and 4.3%, respectively). Fifty-three infants completed a 2-year follow-up. Repeat renal ultrasonography indicated that one infant (1.8%) had developed bilateral hydronephrosis, 12 (22.6%) had unchanged findings, 18 (40%) showed an improvement (decrease of ERpel width or resolution in one side) and, in 22 (41.5%) infants, the condition had resolved. No clinical or kidney function deterioration was observed. Seven patients (13.2%) each had one episode of UTI during the 2-year follow-up period; none of them had VU reflux. Neonatal ERpel is more frequent in male infants. It is associated with greater rates of minor congenital malformations, VU reflux and UTI than in the general population of the same ages. The increased UTI incidence is not attributed to VU reflux."}

Many studies had methodological limitations or were poorly reported. Effectiveness of further investigations: One study found that routine imaging did not lead to a reduction in recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. Diagnostic accuracy: The studies do not support the use of less invasive tests such as ultrasound as an alternative to renal scintigraphy, either to rule out infection of the upper urinary tract (LR- = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.47, 0.68) and thus to exclude patients from further investigation or to detect renal scarring (LR+ = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.5, 4.8). None of the tests investigated can accurately predict the development of renal scarring.

Voiding cystourethrography was performed 8 weeks after the diagnosis. Followup DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 58 patients after 2 years of followup. Urological abnormalities observed were vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, grade 2 or higher) in 11 patients (19%), nonrefluxing and nonobstructed megaureter in 2 (4%) and pyeloureteral obstruction in 1 (2%). The first DMSA scintigraphy showed parenchymal defects in 48% of patients. VUR did not increase the risk of renal defects. At 2 years after the infection 12 of the 58 patients (21%) had renal scars. Nine of these patients did not have VUR. However, 2 patients with high grade VUR and repeat infections demonstrated deterioration of kidney function during followup. The patients with renal scars were older than those without scars (3.1 vs 0.8 years, p = 0.0291) at the time of infection. Renal scars after first pyelonephritis are in most cases not associated with abnormalities of the urinary tract, but are caused by the infection itself. However, structural abnormalities may predispose to recurrent infections. Following pyelonephritis new renal scars may develop in all age groups in both sexes."}

To review our experience using dynamic 99mTc-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid renal scintigraphy combined with indirect radionuclide cystography (IRC) in the acute phase of pyelonephritis, as a possible alternative to the conventional imaging, as investigating acute pyelonephritis usually includes imaging the upper urinary tract during the acute phase, to exclude obstruction, and delayed voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG) when underlying vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) is suspected. Between 1997 and 1999, 47 young women (median age 22 years, range 18-37) were hospitalized for acute pyelonephritis. The combined study was used during the acute phase of the disease, usually within 24 h of hospitalization. The principle of IRC is based on the reappearance of radioactivity in the ureters or kidneys after previously detecting renal clearance of an intravenously injected radioisotope. The increase in radioactivity over the ureters or kidneys indicates VUR. The subsequent follow-up included VCUG, after recovery and at least 6 weeks after discharge. Overall, 47 patients had early IRC studies; obstruction of the urinary tract during the acute phase of the disease was excluded in all. In 13 (28%) of the patients early IRC studies showed VUR involving 21 upper tract units. The renal parenchymal scan was impaired in 17 (36%) patients, and six of these 17 also had detectable concomitant reflux on IRC. Overall, 24 IRC studies (51%) were considered positive, showing VUR, renal parenchymal pathology or both; 23 (49%) were normal. Follow-up VCUG was used in 32 patients (68%); only three (9%) detected VUR. All of the patients with VUR on follow-up VCUG had also had an abnormal early IRC study, showing either reflux (two) or findings suggestive of pathological renal parenchyma (one). In addition to the well-established role of renal scintigraphy in excluding obstruction of the collecting system, early IRC is characterized by high sensitivity and accurate negative predictive value for detecting VUR. It can therefore be used to screen adults presenting with acute pyelonephritis for the presence of VUR. Patients with an abnormal IRC require follow-up VCUG after complete recovery, while those with a negative study may be managed expectantly, with no further radiological evaluation. This proposed strategy may avoid up to half of the delayed VCUG studies, preclude the related inconvenience, and substantially reduce the costs."}

Inflammation is an important indicator of tissue injury. In the acute form, there is usually accumulation of fluids and plasma components in the affected tissues. Platelet activation and the appearance in blood of abnormally increased numbers of polymorphonucleocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages usually occur. Infectious disorders such as sepsis, meningitis, respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, viral infection, and bacterial infection usually induce an inflammatory response. Chronic inflammation is often associated with diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, kidney diseases, and certain auto-immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, organ failures and other disorders with an inflammatory component or etiology. The disorder may occur before inflammation is apparent. Markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and urinary trypsin inhibitors have changed our appraisal of acute events such as myocardial infarction; the infarct may be a response to acute infection and (or) inflammation. We describe here the pathophysiology of an anti-inflammatory agent termed urinary trypsin inhibitor (uTi).

We determined the impact of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on the size of renal lesions in children after an episode of acute pyelonephritis. A total of 161 children (mean age 2.44 years) with acute pyelonephritis were studied. All had renal lesions on dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy done at admission to the hospital. A second dimercapto-succinic acid scan was performed at 3 months. Voiding cystourethrography was done at 6 weeks and VUR was graded I to V. For each renal unit layouts of renal lesions were drawn, and the damage surface was calculated and reported for the total surface of the kidney. Mean size of acute lesions and scars increased with severity of reflux (p <0.0001), with an important overlap of individual values. Mean size of renal scars in the group of renal units with acute lesions was 5.8% +/- 8.5% in patients without VUR, 9.9% +/- 7.3% in those with grade I reflux, 7.7% +/- 11.0% in those with grade II reflux, 17.7% +/- 14.7% in those with grade III reflux and 17.4% +/- 27.7% in those with grade IV reflux (p <0.001). The size of renal lesions decreased significantly with time. The rate of regression of lesions decreased with increasing reflux. When analyzed according to 3 age groups sizes of scars increased significantly with age. VUR has an impact on the size of renal lesions after an episode of pyelonephritis. Children with a grade III or IV reflux are more likely to have larger renal scars. On the other hand, acute lesions of important size may develop even in the absence of VUR."}

A total of 31 males and 14 females (9 days to 9.8 years old) who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for APN and who underwent initial DMSA between January 1995 and July 2002 and followup DMSA at least 6 months later were enrolled in the study. APN was diagnosed by initial DMSA, and placement in the scar or scar-free group was determined by followup DMSA. Photopenic areas on initial DMSA were calculated as Volume, and were compared to US findings. Ultrasound demonstrated 35 abnormal kidneys (38.9%) among these children with APN. Significant differences in age, Volume (11.19 +/- 2.52 ml vs 3.02 +/- 0.75 ml, p <0.005), C-reactive protein (CRP) and photopenic lesion on initial DMSA were found between children with abnormal and normal US. Of 65 children with initial APN foci 33 (50.8%) recovered, and the others had development of scars. The sensitivity of US for detecting APN (identified by DMSA scan) was 49.2%, and the specificity was 88% (OR 7.1, 95% CI 2.18 to 24.41).

Both DMSA and MRI were performed at the same appointment in 37 children (aged 4 months-13 years; mean 4.5 years) with a history of UTI. Both planar and SPECT DMSA were performed. MRI of the kidneys employed axial and coronal T1-, T2- and fat-saturated T1-weighted (T1-W) sequences. Some children had imaging after IV contrast medium. The coronal fat-saturated T1-W sequence was the best sequence and it detected all the findings on MRI. MRI had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 87% for the detection of a scarred kidney using DMSA as the gold standard. MRI diagnosed pyelonephritis in two children that had been interpreted as scarring on DMSA. Renal MRI using a single, coronal, fat-saturated T1-W sequence is a rapid, accurate and minimally invasive technique for the detection of renal scarring that does not employ ionizing radiation."}

To gain new insights into the epidemiology, genitourinary (GU) tract anomalies, etiologies, susceptibility of urinary pathogens to antibiotics in children with urinary tract infection (UTI) during the past decade in Taiwan. By reviewing medical charts for patients admitted to Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital between January 1995 and December 2003, we identified and enrolled patients 14 years of age or less admitted due to UTI that was confirmed by positive urine culture. A total of 597 patients made up our sample. Sixty-eight percent of patients were 1 year old or younger. Boys predominated infant cohort (68.1%). Twenty-seven point one percent of the patients were found in urinalysis to have 5 white blood cells or fewer per high power field and 17.6% had positive nitrite reaction. The pathogens were Escherichia coli, the most common (74.7%), followed by Proteus spp. (6.7%), and Klebsiella spp. (6.4%). E. coli was resistant to ampicillin in 82.0% of the cases, followed by sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (55.2%), gentamicin (24.9%), and cefazolin (24%). Resistance to ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim tended to increase year by year.

From July 1991 to December 2001, a total of 205 infants (180 boys and 25 girls) with primary VUR underwent ureteral reimplantation at the Department of Urology, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Osaka, Japan. Indications for surgery were high-grade reflux (grade IV-V), breakthrough UTI and non-compliance of medical treatment. Age at surgery raged from 1 to 11 months (mean, 6.4 months). Ureteral reimplantation was performed according to Cohen's method. Only two of 336 refluxing ureters required ureteral tailoring. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 110 months (mean, 64 months). Surgical outcome, frequency of UTI and individual renal growth measured by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was evaluated. Postoperative ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography showed neither residual reflux nor ureterovesical obstruction. Contralateral low grade reflux occurred in six of 74 patients (8.1%) who had unilateral reflux preoperatively. After reimplantation, 10 patients documented 13 febrile UTI. Eleven of the 13 episodes occurred early in the postoperative period (<6 months). Frequency of febrile UTI reduced from 0.23538 before surgery to 0.00894 and 0.00081 per patient per month at 6 and 12 months after surgery, respectively. No development of renal scarring was seen in postoperative DMSA scan. Changes of differential renal function was <0.05 in all patients. The present results show ureteral reimplantation in infants is safe and very effective for the prevention of UTI. After surgical treatment in infancy, individual renal growth of children with primary VUR is stable."}

In order to assess the ability of our protocol for antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent perioperative infections in urologic surgery, 1,353 operations of open and laparoscopic urologic surgery conducted in 21 hospitals between September 2002 and August 2003 were subjected to analyses. We classified surgical procedures into four categories by invasiveness and contamination levels: Category A; clean less invasive surgery, Category B; clean invasive or clean-contaminated surgery, Category C; surgery with urinary tract diversion using the intestine. Prophylactic antibiotics were administrated intravenously according to our protocol, such as Category A; first or second generation cephems or penicillins on the operative day only, Category B; first and second generation cephems or penicillins for 3 days, and Category C; first, second or third generation cephems or penicillins for 4 days. The wound conditions and general conditions were evaluated in terms of the surgical site infection (SSI) as well as remote infection (RI) up to postoperative day (POD) 30. The SSI rate highest (23.3%) for surgery with intestinal urinary diversion, followed by 10.0% for surgery for lower urinary tract, 8.9% for nephroureterctomy, and 6.0% for radical prostatectomy. The SSI rates in clean surgery including open and laparoscopic nephrectomy/adrenalectomy were 0.7 and 1.4%, respectively. In SSIs, gram-positive cocci such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (58.8%) or Enterobacter faecalis (26.5%) were the most common pathogen. Similarly, the RI rate was the highest (35.2%) for surgery using intestinal urinary diversion, followed by 16.7% for surgery for lower urinary tract, 11.4% for nephroureterctomy, and 7.6% for radical prostatectomy, while RI rates for clean surgery were less than 5%. RIs most frequently reported were urinary tract infections (2.6%) where Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%) and Enterobacter faecalis (15.3%) were the major causative microorganisms. Parameters such as age, obesity, nutritional status (low proteinemia), diabetes mellitus, lung disease, duration of operation, and blood loss volume were recognized as risk factors for SSI or RI in several operative procedures. Postoperative body temperatures, peripheral white blood counts, C reactive protein (CRP) levels in POD 3 were much higher than those in POD 2 in cases suffering from perioperative infections, especially suggesting that CRP could be a predictable marker for perioperative infections."}

Unilateral pelvis size greater than 8 mm or the sum of the bilateral pelvis sizes greater than 16 mm was associated with VUR, especially severe VUR. The possibility of severe reflux was lower than 10% when the reverse criteria were applied. However, the dilation of the renal pelvis did not predict all VUR precisely. We concluded that VCUG should still be performed in hospitalized children with UTI."}

Procalcitonin is an excellent marker for severe, invasive bacterial infection in children. However, the use of procalcitonin in the diagnosis of neonatal bacterial infection is complicated, but if correctly used procalcitonin results in a higher specificity than C-reactive protein. In addition, procalcitonin has been shown to correlate with severity of disease (urinary tract infections and sepsis), and can therefore be used as a prognostic marker.

Interval changes were categorised as improved, no change, progressed, and new scar formation, and compared between the groups. Prophylactic antibiotics were maintained until the follow-up studies at 4-6 months after surgery. There was no significant difference between the groups in age at the time of operation (mean 42.4 vs 47.4 months), the age at the first documented UTI (mean 26.5 vs 29.3 months), reflux grade, or number of UTI episodes and renal parenchymal scarring on DMSA before surgery.

On VCUG, 52 (79%) patients had clear evidence of PUV, 22 (31%) bladder trabeculation, 11 (16%) vesico-ureteric reflux and eight (11%) diverticula. On cystoscopy, 67 (96%) patients presented with the classic sail-shaped PUV and three a ring-shaped valve. After surgical ablation of the valve most patients dramatically improved; 31 of 42 (74%) had resolution of urinary frequency, 24 of 33 (73%) of diurnal enuresis and 17 of 47 (38%) nocturnal enuresis. Of 57 patients, 39 (68%) established good bladder emptying. Of 33 affected, 20 (60%) had some reduction of hydronephrosis but 63% continued to have some symptoms of voiding dysfunction. PUV should be considered in boys presenting with voiding dysfunction. After valve ablation most patients improve dramatically. Despite surgery, enuresis, urinary frequency and poor bladder emptying persisted in some and required further treatment. The continued bladder dysfunction suggested that irreversible urinary tract damage may have occurred. Even in this apparently mildly affected group, long-term follow-up is essential."}

Forty-three children who had undergone both 99mTc-EC and 99mTc-DMSA studies within 5 days of acute infection were studied. Cortical images of 99mTc-EC were obtained by the sum of the renogram frames achieved between the first 60-120 s of the renogram study. DMSA and EC images were visually interpreted using four points of semiquantitative ratings: 0, normal; 1, mild hypoactivity; 2, moderate hypoactivity with partial loss of margins; 3, marked hypoactivity with loss of cortical margins. Values for the differential renal function were obtained for both studies. DMSA detected a total of 109 lesions in 36 patients and EC detected 90 lesions with a sensitivity of 82.5%. 99mTc-EC successfully detected moderate-to-severe cortical lesions but was less effective with mild lesions (sensitivity 60%). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated good agreement among the results for differential renal function (95% CI -0.26 to 0.96). 99mTc-EC early phase images detected most of the cortical lesions. Its sensitivity depends on the severity of the lesions. EC provided reliable information in the estimation of differential renal function."}

The purpose of this study was to set up normal values of the fractional uptake (FU) of technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid in adults and in the pediatric population, as well as to evaluate the validity of this parameter at different levels of renal function. A total of 86 subjects was divided into seven groups. In group A there were 23 potential kidney donors and in group B, 18 children in remission after a first urinary tract infection. Another three groups consisted of patients with diabetes i.e. group C, seven patients with normal values of albuminuria, group D, 16 patients with microalbuminuria and group E, five patients with macroalbuminuria. In group F, there were ten patients with a well-functioning transplanted kidney and in group G, seven patients with suspected acute rejection. The procedure began with the quantification of the doses of 99mTc-DMSA to be injected and the measurement of the empty syringe lying on the gamma camera collimator. Thereafter, four planar views of the kidneys were acquired three hours after the injection. The counts from the posterior and anterior views were subtracted for background and corrected for radioactive decay time and patient thickness. The FU was calculated by the geometric mean of counts per second from the posterior and anterior view. It was expressed as a fraction of the injected dose. The mean values of FU in healthy adults were 0.227 +/- 0.077 for one kidney and 0.454 +/- 0.146 for both kidneys. The mean values of FU for the left and right kidney were 0.225 +/- +/- 0.071 and 0.229 +/- 0.079, respectively. In children, the mean values were 0.220 +/- 0.092 for one kidney and 0.432 +/- 0.094 for both kidneys. The highest values of FU of 0.322 +/- 0.078 (0.644 +/- 0.138 for both kidneys) were measured in group C. In group D, FU was 0.185 +/- 0.065 (0.361 +/- 0.125 for both kidneys) and in group E 0.082 +/- 0.040 (0.163 +/- 0.080 total). In patients with a transplanted kidney, fractional uptake was 0.162 +/- +/- 0.039 in group F and 0.065 +/- 0.021 in group G. There was no significant difference in the values of FU between healthy adults and children. The uptake in group C was 41% higher than in group A and the difference was statistically significant. In groups D and E, the uptake was significantly lower than in A. In both groups of patients with transplanted kidneys, the uptake was significantly lower than in control group. The correlation between FU and biochemical parameters of renal function [blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr) and creatinine clearance (CCr)] was significant: FU/BUN r = -0.86; FU/Cr r = -0.77; FU/CCr r = 0.60. Fractional uptake of 99mTc-DMSA could serve as a sensitive parameter of renal function. The mean values of FU in adults were 0.454 and in children 0.432. There was no significant difference between values for the left and right kidney. In diabetes mellitus, fractional uptake correlated well with the degree of diabetic nephropathy. In patients with a well-functioning transplant, the uptake was slightly reduced. Low values of fractional uptake in acute rejection were related to lesions in kidney blood vessels and in tubular cells."}

The management of high grade vesicoureteral reflux remains controversial, with breakthrough infections being an indication for surgical repair. We sought to determine if technetium dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan could help predict which children are at risk for breakthrough urinary tract infection. A retrospective review was performed on children presenting with a febrile urinary tract infection and prenatal hydronephrosis who were found to have vesicoureteral reflux and underwent a DMSA scan. Reflux was tabulated according to the highest grade. DMSA results were graded as 0-normal, no parenchymal or size defects, grade 1-focal parenchymal defects or less than a quarter of a renal unit involved, or grade 2-severe defects to include at least half of a renal unit, bilateral defects or unilateral atrophy. A total of 120 consecutive patients were evaluated. An abnormal DMSA scan was documented in 57 (33 females and 24 males), and 35 with grade 1 and 22 with grade 2 defects. Of the patients 53 females and 10 males had a normal scan. Of the 57 children with an abnormal DMSA scan 6% presented with grades 1 and 2 vesicoureteral reflux, 24% with grade 3, 38% with grade 4 and 26% with grade 5. Of the children with grades 3 to 5 reflux 60% had a subsequent breakthrough infection. Of the 63 children with a normal DMSA scan 11% presented with grade 1 reflux, 28% with grade 2, 48% with grade 3, 11% with grade 4 and 2% with grade 5. Of these children 5 had a subsequent breakthrough infection. An abnormality on DMSA scan in the presence of grade 3 to 5 reflux correlates with a greater chance of having a breakthrough infection (60%). We conclude that children with grade 3 to 5 vesicoureteral reflux and an abnormal DMSA scan are at increased risk for breakthrough urinary tract infection."}

A retrospective analysis of the records of 303 children younger than 2 years with initial UTI investigated with DMSA scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography (VCU) within 3 months after UTI was performed. In 156 of the 303 children (51%) DMSA scintigraphy showed renal lesions. VUR was found in 80 patients (26%) and VUR grade significantly correlated with the presence of renal lesions. A normal DMSA scintigraphy and dilating VUR (grade III) occurred in 7 infants. At followup after 1 to 2 years, 6 of these 7 patients had normal DMSA scans and 1 had a scarred duplex kidney. VUR resolved spontaneously in 5 and improved spontaneously to grade 1 in 2 patients. None of the 7 children had recurrent UTI. DMSA scintigraphy in infants with UTI may replace VCU as a first line investigation. A strategy to perform VCU in only patients with renal lesions is proposed. In this study 147 of 303 VCUs would have been unnecessary as only 1 child with a damaged kidney was missed."}
{"id": "15309597", "title": "Screening for vesicoureteral reflux and renal scars in siblings of children with known reflux.", "content": "Screening for vesicoureteral reflux and renal scars in siblings of children with known reflux. The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in the general population is less than 1%, but it is high in families with reflux. The reported prevalence of VUR among siblings of index patients with reflux has ranged from 4.7% to 51%. Reflux carries an increased risk of pyelonephritis and long-term renal impairment. The purpose of this study was to identify the age-related incidence and severity of reflux, and the frequency of associated renal parenchymal damage in siblings of children with reflux in order to assess the use of screening at different ages. Between October 1994 and February 2003, 40 siblings of 34 index patients were screened with direct voiding cystography. 99( m ) technetium (Tc)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) nuclear renal scans were performed in siblings with VUR to detect renal scarring. The cystograms were interpreted as showing the presence or absence of VUR and the DMSA scan as symmetrical or asymmetrical differential function, with or without renal scarring. Of 40 siblings, 17 had VUR, representing an incidence of 42.5%. The mean age at study entry of the 15 boys and 25 girls was 63 months (range 6 months to 12 years). The majority of siblings with abnormal DMSA scans were asymptomatic. Reflux was unilateral in 12 siblings and bilateral in 5. Of the 17 refluxing siblings (22 refluxing ureters), 7 (41.17%) had a history of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). The frequency of VUR was nearly equal in siblings over 6 years and those younger than 6 years. Of the 17 siblings with VUR, 16 had DMSA scintigraphy. Of these, 5 were normal and 11 (68.75%) showed abnormalities (7 asymmetrical differential function and 4 parenchymal defect), which was bilateral in 7 and unilateral in 4. In conclusion, this study confirms a significant overall incidence of VUR and renal parenchymal damage in the siblings of patients with known reflux. The prevalence of reflux in older siblings is similar to that in younger siblings. Our review suggests that all siblings over 6 years should undergo a screening cystogram, even in the absence of urinary tract infection. DMSA scintigraphy of asymptomatic siblings appears to be beneficial in preventing renal injury."}

Febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem among children. The diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. The distinction between acute pyelonephritis and UTI without renal involvement is very important, because renal infection may cause parenchymal scarring and thus requires more aggressive investigation and follow-up monitoring. However, this distinction is not easy among children, because common clinical findings and laboratory parameters are nonspecific, especially among young children. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from febrile UTI without renal lesions in a group of 100 children, we measured serum levels of procalcitonin (PCT), a new marker of infection. The objective of the study was to determine the accuracy of PCT measurements, compared with C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, in diagnosing acute renal involvement during febrile UTI and in predicting subsequent scars, as assessed with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Serum CRP levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, leukocyte counts, and PCT levels were measured for 100 children, 1 month to 13 years of age, admitted for suspected febrile UTI (first episode). Renal parenchymal involvement was evaluated with DMSA scintigraphy within 5 days after admission. The DMSA study was repeated 6 months later if the initial results were abnormal. The mean PCT level was significantly higher in acute pyelonephritis than in UTI without renal lesions (4.48 +/- 5.84 ng/mL vs 0.44 +/- 0.30 ng/mL). In these 2 groups, the mean CRP levels were 106 +/- 68.8 mg/L and 36.4 +/- 26 mg/L, mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates were 79.1 +/- 33 mm/hour and 58.5 +/- 33 mm/hour, and leukocyte counts were 18 492 +/- 6839 cells/mm3 and 16 741 +/- 5302 cells/mm3, respectively. For the prediction of acute pyelonephritis, the sensitivity and specificity of PCT measurements were 83.3% and 93.6%, respectively; CRP measurements had a sensitivity of 94.4% but a specificity of only 31.9%. Positive and negative predictive values for prediction of renal involvement with PCT measurements were 93.7% and 83% and those with CRP measurements were 61.4% and 83.3%, respectively. When inflammatory markers were correlated with the severity of the renal lesions, as assessed with DMSA scintigraphy, a highly significant correlation with both PCT and CRP levels was found. However, when the 2 parameters were correlated with renal scarring in follow-up scans, a significant positive association was found only for PCT levels. Serum PCT levels may be a sensitive and specific measure for early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and determination of the severity of renal parenchymal involvement. Therefore, this measurement could be useful for the treatment of children with febrile UTIs, allowing prediction of patients at risk of permanent parenchymal renal lesions."}

In total, 39 men, who presented at our department with a fever higher than 38.3 degrees C, were randomly selected. We investigated the fraction of patients who had serum PSA levels higher than 4.0 ng/ml and categorized them according to an initial diagnosis of pyelonephritis, ABP, other urogenital infections, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). Six of nine cases initially diagnosed as pyelonephritis, presented with elevated PSA levels between 9.5 and 75.1 ng/ml. All six cases of clinically diagnosed prostatitis had PSA elevated between 4.1 and 13.6 ng/ml. In 8 of 18 FUO cases, PSA was elevated between 5.1 and 77.0 ng/ml. PSA levels significantly correlated with age (P < 0.005). All 20 patients with elevated PSA received antibiotics, and serum PSA was significantly reduced in all cases (P < 0.001) together with the alleviation of fever and normalization of CRP. PSA is a prompt and steady diagnostic tool for identifying ABP that might be missed or misdiagnosed. We recommend the measurement of PSA in cases not only with urologic infection but also puzzling pyrexia."}

When used, renal scintigraphy was normal in 74% of siblings, vs 18% of index patients. However, when screened after 2 years old, siblings had twice the risk of already having renal damage on renal scintigraphy (P = 0.04).

The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 5.5 years. In 92% of cases, reflux presented in the form of acute pyelonephritis (APN). 88.5% of the patients contacted declared that they were in good general health and 15.4% of males and 50.6% of females presented episodes of cystitis. However, only 16% of females and no males reported episodes of APN. The presence of renal lesions did not statistically increase the risk of febrile urinary tract infection. No case of APN occurred during the 37 pregnancies reported. One female patient suffered from renal failure due to an aetiology unrelated to reflux. One female patient with a scarred kidney before the operation presented hypertension. This study shows that the outcome of patients operated for primary VRR in childhood is favourable despite the persistence of APN. The increasingly early surgical management of VRR will certainly be optimized by long-term follow-up studies with initial assessment of the lesions based on scintigraphic techniques."}

Mean resistance rates were in all bacteria (in E. coli): Ampicillin 53 % (69 %), Ampicillin and Sulbactam 51 % (61 %), Cefalosporin 1 (st) generation (Cefaclor) 48 % (24 %), Cefalosporin 2 (nd) generation (Cefuroxim) 40 % (3 %), Cefalosporin 3 (rd) generation (Cefuroxim) 33 % (0 %), Tobramycin 30 % (2 %), Ciprofloxacine 0 %, Cotrimoxazole 40 % (42 %), Nitrofurantoin 12 % (0 %). The resistance rates to Ampicillin (+/- Sulbactam) did not increase as compared to previous analyses (1990 - 1995), however, resistance rates to Cotrimoxazole and 1 (st) generation Cefalosporines increased about 20 %. We conclude that the policies for treatment of UTI in children should be re-evaluated every 5 years according to local resistance rates."}

Renal cortical scintigraphic studies challenge the role of vesicoureteric reflux in renal scar development, emphasizing instead the part played by acute pyelonephritis. To determine the prevalence of renal cortical defects in a child cohort 2 years after the child's first diagnosed urinary tract infection and to analyze the relationship of these defects with acute illness variables, primary vesicoureteric reflux and recurrent infections. In a prospective cohort study, 193 children younger than 5 years with their first proven urinary tract infection underwent renal sonography, voiding cystourethrogram, and renal cortical scintigraphy within 15 days of diagnosis. Two years later, 150 of the 193 children, or 77.7%, had a further renal cortical scintigram, including 75, or 86.2%, of the 87 children who had acute scintigraphic defects. The relationship of cortical defects to age, gender, pre-treatment symptom duration, hospitalization, presence and grade of vesicoureteric reflux, and recurrent urinary tract infections was evaluated. Overall, 20 of the 150 (13.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.3, 19.8) children had persistent defects 2 years after infection. This included 20 of 75 (26.7%; 95% CI 17.1, 38.1) with initially abnormal scintigrams. No new defects were detected. Although acute defects were more common in the young, those with persistent defects were older (median ages 16.4 vs. 6.8 months, P=0.004) than those with transient abnormalities. After adjustment for age, persistent defects were no longer associated with gender and were not predicted by acute illness variables, primary vesicoureteric reflux or recurrent infections. Renal cortical scintigraphic defects persisted in approximately one-quarter of young children after their first proven urinary tract infection. The associated clinical features, however, failed to predict scar formation. It is possible that some of the scintigraphic defects preceded the infection by arising from either previously undiagnosed acute pyelonephritis or from underlying congenital dysplasia. The etiology of scars may be best addressed by determining whether prevention of urinary tract infections from birth avoids post-natal scar acquisition or extension."}

Suspected sepsis and hyperbilirubinemia were the main presenting features. Community-acquired and nasocomial UTI accounted for 63% and 37% of cases, respectively. The leading causative agents were Escherichia coli for community-acquired UTI and Klebsiella pneumoniae for nasocomial UTI. The urosepsis rate was 5%. Abnormal ultrasonography findings were present in 23% and vesicoureteral reflux was present in 15% of babies. A total of 23% of patients showed renal photopenic areas on dimercaptosuccinic acid scan. The recurrence rate was 28% occurring between 1.5 and 12 months, in particular in the first 6 months. Most of the recurrences developed in patients with no predisposing abnormalities.

The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children remains a clinical challenge. It may cause permanent renal scar formation and results in the chronic renal failure if prompt diagnosis and treatment are delayed. The purpose of this study is to compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and renal cortical scintigraphy (RCS) findings in childhood acute pyelonephritis and to determine pyelonephritic foci in the acute phase. Twenty children (15 females and five males) with symptoms dysuria, enuresis, costovertebral pain, fever of 37.5 degrees C or more and/or positive urine culture were imaged by unenhanced turbo spin echo T2, spin echo T1-weighted, pre- and post-gadolinium inversion recovery MRI and RCS. Both imaging techniques were read independently by two radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI in detecting acute pyelonephritic foci and scar lesions were calculated. Furthermore, in order to calculate the reliability of MRI over RCS in differentiating scar tissue and acute pyelonephritic foci, follow-up MRI studies were done in six patients after treatment of acute pyelonephritis. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI in the detection of pyelonephritic lesions were found to be 90.9 and 88.8%, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference in lesion detection between the two diagnostic modalities (P>0.05). Post-gadolinium MR images show significant correlation with RCS in the determination of renal pathology. Moreover, the ability of discriminating acute pyelonephritic foci and renal scar in early stages of disease is the superiority of MRI."}

We determined the diagnostic value of the trypsin inhibitor, uristatin, that is commonly found in urine and plasma in patients with infections or inflammations of any kind. We collected urine specimens from patients with infections of the urinary or upper respiratory tract and from healthy controls. We also collected blood from patients with a likely upper respiratory tract infection and healthy controls. A bacterial count of >10(5) organisms/ml in urine was considered to represent infection rather than contamination. The uristatin dipstick test in urine showed acceptable negative predictive values (NPV of up to 93%) for patients without infection or inflammation. Here, the dipsticks could eliminate some urine cultures. For those with infection or inflammation, the positive predictive values (PPV) of the dipsticks were lower (up to 57%).

This study was performed to evaluate a quantitative method based on (99m)Tc-DMSA renal planar scintigraphy performed during acute pyelonephritis (APN) to detect kidneys at risk of scarring. A total of 43 children (5.8 +/- 3.6 y old [mean +/- SD]) were examined by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy during (DMSA 1) and 8 +/- 2 mo after (DMSA 2) APN. Two levels of interpretation were performed independently: first, a semiquantitative analysis to classify the kidneys by considering the evolution between DMSA 1 and DMSA 2 (i.e., to determine which kidneys had developed scarring), and second, an automatic quantitative analysis of DMSA 1 to define and to evaluate a predictive index for kidney evolution from DMSA 1 to DMAS 2. The method consisted of determining an automatic threshold for the kidney and then calculating ratios of the count density in a given isocount n% (region of interest containing all the pixels with a value > or = n% of the value of the pixel with the maximal activity value) to the count density in a 20% isocount (C(n%)) and the number of pixels in a given isocount to the number of pixels in a 20% isocount (S(n%)). All kidneys normal at DMSA 1 remained normal at DMSA 2. For the automatic index, the C(70%) ratio was considered the best index for the prediction of scarring. When this C(70%) ratio was used, a cutoff value of 0.45 was able to predict scarring with a sensitivity of 0.83, a specificity of 0.78, a positive predictive value of 0.85, and a negative predictive value of 0.77. A cutoff value of 0.45 for the C(70%) ratio calculated for (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy performed during APN may be useful for detecting kidneys at risk of scarring."}

The study included 97 patients (60 boys, 37 girls) with MCDK seen between 1985 and 1998; 82 were diagnosed in utero by ultrasonography (US). After birth, the diagnosis was verified by US, renal scanning (in 93) or intravenous urography (in four), and 89 (92%) had voiding cysto-urethrography (VCUG). Of the 97 children, 87 (90% had a mean (range) follow-up of 44.3 (15-115) months. The MCDK was removed in 17 children; the follow-up of 75 children (five lost to follow-up) showed total involution of the MCDK in 25%, shrinkage in 60% and a stable size in 15%. None had any sign of malignancy. The contralateral kidney showed anomalies in 19 of 97 children (20%); 12 had a dilated renal pelvis (two with megaureter), six had a high echogenicity of the contralateral kidney (one had reflux, and two also pelvic dilatation). In only four of the 89 children was reflux found by VCUG; 16 of the 19 anomalies were detected by US. Five children needed surgery on the contralateral urinary tract (three a pyeloplasty, and one each a pyeloplasty plus ureteroneocystostomy, and an antireflux procedure). Of the contralateral kidneys 43% showed compensatory hypertrophy. There was mild renal insufficiency in three children; renal function seemed to be slightly impaired in many. Five infants had hypertension (four with spontaneous resolution) caused by renal scarring after pyelonephritis or inborn dysplasia of the contralateral kidney. There were symptomatic urinary tract infections in seven children. US can be used safely to diagnose unilateral MCDKs and malformations of the contralateral urinary tract and kidney. In cases where US of the dysplastic kidney remains uncertain renal scintigraphy is necessary to detect the lack of renal function. The low rate of reflux makes routine VCUG unnecessary if the contralateral upper urinary tract and kidney appear to be normal on US. Nephrectomy of the dysplastic kidney in typical cases is also unnecessary. A long-term nephro-urological follow-up of children with MCDK is recommended."}

Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) study has been advocated as a method for the assessment of renal sequelae after acute febrile urinary tract infection (UTI). However, it is not known whether DMSA scintigraphy performed during acute UTI has any prognostic value for outcome assessment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of DMSA scintigraphy performed during UTI as a predictor of patient outcome, to identify children at risk of events [vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) or recurrent UTI] that may lead to the development of progressive renal damage. One hundred and fifty-two children (including 78 girls) with a mean age of 20 months (range 1 month to 12 years) with first febrile UTI were evaluated by DMSA scintigraphy during acute UTI. After acute UTI, children were explored by voiding cysto-urethrography. Children who presented an abnormal DMSA study, or a normal DMSA study but VUR or recurrent UTI, underwent a DMSA control study 6 months after UTI. Children with VUR were followed up by direct radionuclide cystography. DMSA scintigraphy performed during acute UTI was normal in 112 children (74%). In 95 of these children, follow-up DMSA scintigraphy was not performed owing to a good clinical outcome. In the remaining 17 children, follow-up scintigraphy was normal. Forty children (26%) presented abnormal DMSA study during acute UTI. Twenty-five of them presented a normal follow-up DMSA, and 15 presented cortical lesions. Children with abnormal DMSA had a higher frequency of VUR than children with normal DMSA (48% vs 12%). It is concluded that children with normal DMSA during acute UTI have a low risk of renal damage. Children with normal follow-up DMSA and low-grade VUR have more frequent spontaneous resolution of VUR."}

Six days later, C-reactive protein was rising and the patient was suffering from intermittent high fever, dyspnoea and severe hypoxaemia. The high-resolution-computed tomography (HRCT) showed an interstitial lung disease in the anterior upper lobe on the left side as well as in the lingula. Assuming a bacterial infection amoxyl/clavulanic acid was started which did not improve the clinical symptoms. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a marked lymphocytosis (87%). Analysis for typical bacterial infections, Tuberculosis, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Legionella spp. were all negative. Another HRCT scan was made because of worsening of symptoms and this showed rapidly progressive infiltrates in most lobes. An open lingular biopsy showed an interstitial lymphoplasmocytotic infiltrate with some eosinophilic granulocytes and a few scattered giant cell granulomas, consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The patient's symptoms rapidly improved with systemic corticosteroid therapy and another HRCT scan revealed complete remission of pulmonary infiltrates. Ciprofloxacin can induce interstitial pneumonitis with acute respiratory failure. This is an important fact considering that ciprofloxacin is a widely used antibiotic agent in treatment of urinary tract infection."}

In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured intrarenal resistive index (RI). We evaluated its ability to predict renal involvement as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In total 157 patients admitted to the pediatric department of the Si\u015fli Etfal Hospital with clinical signs of febrile UTI were included in the study. The children were divided into groups according to their age at the time of ultrasonography (US). RI was measured from the renal arteries with Doppler US in the first 72 h in all 157 children. Renal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. The examination was repeated at least 6 months later if the first result was abnormal. All available patients with an abnormal scintigraphy underwent voiding cystourethrography 4-6 weeks after the acute infection. All patients with vesicoureteral reflux and scarred kidneys were excluded from the study. DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated abnormal changes in 114 of 157 children and was normal in the remaining 43 children. Of these 114 children, 104 underwent repeat scintigraphy, of whom 77 showed partially or totally reversible lesion(s). Of these 77 children, 17 children (22%) with vesicoureteral reflux were excluded. Thus, we compared the 43 children with lower UTI with the 60 children with definite acute pyelonephritis at admission. Kidneys with changes of acute pyelonephritis had a mean RI of 0.744+/-0.06 in infants, 0.745+/-0.03 in preschool children, and 0.733+/-0.09 in patients of school age with upper UTI. However, the mean RI was 0.703+/-0.06 in infants, 0.696+/-0.1 in preschool children, and 0.671+/-0.09 in school-aged patients with lower UTI. The mean RI values were significantly higher in patients with upper UTI ( P<0.001). There was a highly significant correlation between RI values and the severity of the renal lesion as ranked by DMSA scintigraphy ( P<0.001). When the cut-off RI value was 0.715, there was an 80% sensitivity and a 89% specificity for diagnosing upper UTI. Refluxing kidneys and scarred kidneys also had higher RI values. In conclusion, RI values were increased significantly in children with febrile UTI when renal parenchymal involvement (assessed by DMSA scintigraphy) was present. Our results also support the view that the children with high RI values are at a high risk of reflux, scarring, or both, which was frequently observed in febrile UTI. This might allow identification of patients at risk for severe renal lesions that require more aggressive therapy, investigation, and follow-up than those with lower UTI."}

This paper describes the experience of a tertiary pediatric referral hospital performing ultrasonography and DMSA scans in the assessment of renal scarring. Investigations were conducted 3-6 months after patients presented with urinary tract infection (UTI). Results were extracted from the radiology information system and recorded for analysis. All children with a UTI who had undergone DMSA and ultrasound examination on the same day between January 1995 and December 1999 were included; 930 kidneys were compared. DMSA scan was utilized as the reference method. When used to detect focal renal scarring, ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 5.2%, specificity of 98.3%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 75.8%. When used to detect diffuse renal scarring, ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 47.2%, specificity of 91.8%, PPV of 60.8% and NPV of 86.6%. Our results demonstrate that although ultrasonography has a good specificity for the detection of renal scarring compared with DMSA, it has low sensitivity, PPV and NPV.

We retrospectively reviewed the case notes and DMSA scans of the 45 patients who underwent a scan within 9 wk of their transplant to see if pre or peri-transplant factors or post-transplant complications were associated with defects on scanning. Forty percentage of scans had defects. The presence of defects was not associated with potential predisposing factors such as patient or donor age, cadaveric or live donation, cold ischemia time, multiple donor vessels, the use of non-heart beating donors, the mean time to scan, the serum creatinine, or the presence of structural renal tract anomalies predisposing to UTI. However, 87% of patients had complications before the scan, including UTI, rejection, acute tubular necrosis, transplant biopsy and drug toxicity. Children with no clinical complications had a significantly reduced risk of a defect (p = 0.035), while biopsy was associated with the presence of defects (p = 0.0034). Twenty patients had one or more follow up DMSA scans: one patient developed a new focal defect. In conclusion, renal transplant defects are frequently found on DMSA scanning even early after transplantation and are non-specifically associated with many different complications."}

Douching three or more times per month, history of ectopic pregnancy, and two or more prior urinary tract infections were associated with endometritis, as was elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < or = .05). Physical examination findings and mean CD4+ lymphocyte count were similar among those with and without endometritis. In the nine HIV-infected women with a repeat biopsy, endometritis decreased from four (44%) to two (22%) after treatment (P = .30). The prevalence of histologic endometritis in HIV-infected women was high despite few examination findings and no demonstrated pathogens. Endometritis in HIV-infected women might be related to pathogens not evaluated, to prior infection, or to reduced immunity from HIV."}

To evaluate the renal growth pattern in patients with primary vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) using long-term measurements of split renal function with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In all, 712 children aged < 16 years (466 boys and 246 girls) with primary VUR were referred to our hospital from July 1991 to December 2000. VUR was diagnosed by voiding cysto-urethrography. The patients were treated either surgically (group 1) or conservatively (group 2) and followed with serial 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy for up to 10 years. There were 942 examinations in 367 of 712 patients who had repeat scintigraphy. Patients with secondary VUR, VUR to a solitary or fused kidney, or upper urinary tract obstruction, were excluded. Five of 298 patients (1.7%) who had ureteric reimplantation had a febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) soon after surgery but none recurred (recurrence is an indication for surgery in children with VUR); there was no febrile UTI in the 69 patients in group 2. Planar scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA was used to assess the absolute uptake (AU) of each kidney, measured as a percentage of the injected dose, and the relative uptake (RU = AU of each kidney/AU of both kidneys) calculated. The initial examination was at least 4 weeks after any febrile UTI in most patients. Serial studies were conducted 1 year after surgery and then biannually in group 1. In group 2 the DMSA scan was repeated every 2-3 years. The change in split renal function was compared with the RU of the right kidney. The RU of the right kidney at the initial scan correlated closely with those on repeated scans in both groups. The correlation coefficients were 0.99 in group 1 and 0.94-0.97 in group 2 at every study. The change of RU remained within 0.05 in all patients after treatment. Under strict control of UTI, split renal function in children with primary VUR does not change. There may be no possibility of accelerated or compensatory growth of the kidney with reflux nephropathy, but no concern about deterioration and atrophy either."}

The value of (123)I-hippuran (OIH) renal sequential scintigraphy (RSS) in predicting the evolution of defects detected by (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning during a first episode of acute pyelonephritis (APN) was assessed. Fifty-eight children with APN underwent (99m)Tc-DMSA planar scanning and (123)I-OIH RSS during acute infection and at least 5 mo later. Renal lesions found by (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning were classified according to the following (99m)Tc-DMSA grading system: 0 = normal, 1 = 1 lesion, 2 = 2 lesions, and 3 = diffuse damage with renal parenchymal subversion. Renal scarring was diagnosed whenever a renal cortical defect detected at the first (99m)Tc-DMSA examination persisted on the follow-up (99m)Tc-DMSA examination. Single-kidney clearance rate (Cl) was evaluated by a method that was previously validated at our institution and is based on time-activity curves measured on the heart and kidney areas by the region-of-interest technique. (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning showed renal damage in 76 kidneys and had negative findings for the remaining 40 kidneys (2 patients had bilaterally negative findings). (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning determined 40 kidneys to be grade 0, 49 to be grade 1, 21 to be grade 2, and 6 to be grade 3. For (99m)Tc-DMSA grades of 0-3, the corresponding Cl mean values (in mL/min/1.73 m(2) of body surface area [BSA]) were 292 +/- 33, 237 +/- 39, 210 +/- 54, and 140 +/- 53, respectively. The Spearman regression coefficient (R) demonstrated a significant correlation between (99m)Tc-DMSA grade and Cl (R = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Thirty-six of the lesions detected by staging (99m)Tc-DMSA were shown to have recovered on follow-up renal scans, whereas 40 developed scars. A significant difference in Cl was found between the 2 groups (P < 0.0002). The Cl cutoff value was determined by univariate discriminant analysis; a Cl value of 232 mL/min/1.73 m(2) of BSA discriminated best between scarred and nonscarred kidneys, with a specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of 95%, 95%, 90%, 97%, and 95%, respectively. Cl evaluation, in the course of acute urinary tract infection, is highly valuable in predicting the fibrotic evolution of renal damage detected on acute (99m)Tc-DMSA scanning. Also, our data show close agreement between Cl and the grade determined by staging (99m)Tc-DMSA."}

The purpose of this study was to semiquantify the magnitude of surgical stress in patients undergoing aortic surgery by measuring inflammatory responses perioperatively, focusing on cytokine secretion. Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL) 1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrotizing factor (TNF) Alpha were measured in patients undergoing abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysmectomy preoperatively and periodically thereafter for 2 weeks. Urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI/Cr) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score also were determined. Indices of inflammation and cytokine concentrations peaked at 1-3 days after surgery and decreased thereafter; however, IL-8 increased again after day 7. Concentrations of IL-8, UTI/Cr, and CRP and the SIRS score were still higher 14 days after surgery than preoperatively. The maximum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were higher after thoracic than abdominal aortic repair; however, the maximum values of cytokines were not correlated with operative factors in all patients. A patient suffering from graft infection showed an increase in cytokine concentrations on day 7. The inflammatory response does not return to preoperative values within 2 weeks of surgery in patients undergoing thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The prolonged secretion of IL-8 suggests a host reaction to the synthetic prosthesis. A large increase in inflammatory cytokines on day 7 may indicate infection of the vascular graft."}

We evaluated the frequency of renal damage 10-20 years after hospitalization for AP in adult women and the utility of technetium Tc 99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc 99m-DMSA) scanning for detection of renal scars; 63 of 203 women hospitalized with AP during 1982-1992 were included in the study. Tc 99m-DMSA scanning detected renal scarring in 29 women (46%). Multivariate analysis showed that pregnancy and hypoalbuminemia (albumin level, <3.2 g/dL) at hospitalization were independent risk factors for subsequent development of renal scars. At follow-up, hypertension was observed in approximately one-fifth of patients, regardless of renal scarring status. Four women with scars had a glomerular filtration rate of < or =75 mL/min; none of them developed severe renal impairment. In conclusion, the risk of developing renal scarring after AP in adult women is high. However, clinically relevant renal damage is rare 10-20 years after AP. Tc 99m-DMSA scanning is useful for detecting renal scars in adults but is not routinely needed in practice."}

We retrospectively reviewed the DMSA renal scans of infants with VUR without a history of urinary tract infection (UTI). DMSA differential uptake less than or equal to 40% or cortical defects were considered as renal abnormalities. The findings were correlated with those of postnatal renal ultrasonography. Eighteen patients (15 boys and 3 girls) were included with VUR grade V, IV, III and II in 5, 10, 6 and 6, respectively, of the 36 renal units. DMSA revealed parenchymal abnormalities in 50% (9/18) of the patients and in 33% (9/27) of the renal units with VUR; most of the patients were boys (7 boys, 2 girls) with VUR grade V or IV (6/9; 66%). Postnatal ultrasonography showed low sensitivity (22%) to renal injury. In infants with sterile VUR, especially boys with high grade VUR, kidney abnormalities can already be present at birth suggesting a pathophysiology of renal injury independent of UTI. Moreover, renal parenchymal defects detected by DMSA renal scan are frequently not identified by postnatal renal ultrasound. Therefore, we recommend DMSA scanning in the initial evaluation of infants with VUR."}

The diagnosis of renal scarring was obtained by dimercaptosuccinic acid scan 5 months after the treatment of the urinary infection; in 40 children the dimercaptosuccinic acid scan was performed again from 6 months up to 6 years after the treatment. 45 children (77.6%) were girls and 13 (22.4%) were boys, 51.7% were 2 years old or younger. The incidence of renal scarring was 55.2%. There was significant higher proportion of renal scars in girls, when the patients presented fever and dilated vesicoureteral reflux (III, IV, V). Fever and female sex were risk factors for the development of renal scars (fever--ODDS ratio=6.19 and female sex--ODDS ratio=4.12). There was a prevalence of renal scars in children over 2 years old. The interval between the beginning of the symptoms and the first medical visit was longer in the children with renal scars. New renal scars were observed in 12.5%. Fever and female sex were risk factors for the presence of renal scars, mainly in the dilated vesicoureteral reflux. The high incidence of renal scars in this study may be related to delayed diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux."}

General consensus on the optimal treatment of septic infants with primary high-grade vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and renal function impairment has not been reached. Our study aims at evaluating the role of temporary urinary diversion. Twenty male infants, affected by sepsis and primary high-grade VUR, underwent urinary diversion in 1996-2001 because of estimated risk of renal function deterioration, due to non-compliance with the antibiotic treatment. Plasmatic creatinine clearance, ultrasonography, micturition cystography and scintigraphy were evaluated. Creatinine clearance was abnormal in 13 infants on admission, in 10 after urinary diversion and in 6 after second surgery. Renal damage (focal or diffuse) was evident in 16 patients, without modifications after surgery. No patient developed urinary tract infections (UTI). Vesicostomy was done in 12 cases, ureterostomy in 8. Nephrectomy was performed in 3 cases with poor renal function, and ureteroneocystostomy in 17. Urinary diversion in septic infants with high-grade VUR can represent an alternative approach to the conservative or surgical treatment in selected patients presenting risk of renal function impairment. This procedure allowed an easy management of UTI without worsening of renal function while waiting for a better anatomical status to perform reconstructive surgery."}

A combination of nuclear medicine, ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography is typically used to investigate hydronephrosis in children. A major problem is the lack of an accepted gold standard to assess obstruction. In some cases the anatomy is unclear. By combining anatomical and functional information in one study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential of providing superior information regarding hydronephrosis. We evaluate the role of dynamic enhanced MRI and compare it to other imaging modalities in the investigation of pediatric hydronephrosis. One hundred dynamic contrast enhanced MRIs were performed in 96 children (35 girls and 61 boys, mean age 4 years [range 1 month to 17 years]). The information from the various imaging modalities was compared. The MRI protocol was acceptable to all families and was performed without complications in all patients. The morphological imaging with MRI was superior to conventional imaging in all cases. The split renal function as calculated by nuclear and MRI scans was compared in 71 cases, and the correlation coefficient was r2 = 0.93. The combination of ultrasound and a nuclear medicine study correlated with the final diagnosis of the MRI in 50 of 64 studies (78%). Of the 14 studies that differed 8 were obstructed on MRI but not on the nuclear studies, and 5 were not obstructed on MRI but were obstructed on the nuclear studies. One patient believed to have ureteropelvic junction obstruction on nuclear medicine scan had ureterovesical junction obstruction on MRI. The final diagnoses by MRI were ureteropelvic junction obstruction in 26 children, primary ureterovesical junction obstruction in 14, dilated but not obstructed systems in 35, duplex systems in 13, multicystic dysplastic kidneys in 5, unilateral small scarred kidney in 1, acute pyelonephritis in 2, renal mass in 1, bilateral polycystic kidneys in 1 and normal study in 9.

Breakthrough urinary tract infections (UTI) are considered an indication for surgical intervention in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) with the goal of preventing new or progressive renal scarring. We assessed the incidence of new renal parenchymal inflammatory changes following breakthrough UTI in patients on antibiotic prophylaxis for VUR. We prospectively analyzed 38 patients (62 refluxing renal units) with VUR. All patients experienced a culture documented breakthrough UTI (greater than 100,000 cfu/ml) while taking antibiotic prophylaxis. Dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scans were obtained 4 to 6 weeks after UTI to detect new renal inflammatory changes and all scans were reviewed by the same pediatric nuclear medicine specialist (MM). To avoid misinterpretation of preexistent renal scarring for acute inflammation, new pyelonephritis was confirmed by comparison to prior DMSA scan. Of 38 patients 14 (38%) had preexistent renal scarring but only 1 (7%) manifested new changes on DMSA scan. Of the remaining 24 patients with normal baseline studies 3 (12.5%) had changes after UTI. Overall, only 4 patients (10.5%) manifested new changes on DMSA scan. Three additional patients who did not have a baseline scan for comparison demonstrated unequivocal changes of acute pyelonephritis on DMSA scan, increasing the incidence to 17% (7 of 41). Of the patients 7 (17%) underwent surgical correction of reflux and 34 (83%) were maintained on antibiotic prophylaxis. Of patients with VUR who experienced a single breakthrough UTI while on antibiotic prophylaxis, at most only 17% had renal inflammatory changes on acute DMSA scan. Our findings endorse the usefulness of DMSA scan in tailoring management of VUR and breakthrough UTI cases, and lend support to continued nonoperative management for the majority."}

We prospectively determined the SLPI concentration in 152 febrile patients (median 73 [inter-quantile range (IQR): 58-82] year; 50% male) admitted to hospital because of infection of the airways (n = 44) or pneumonia (n = 108; i.e. consolidation on chest X-ray), and in 48 febrile patients (78 [IQR: 71-85] year; 52% male) admitted because of pyelonephritis, as well as afebrile age-matched controls (n = 38). In addition, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), peripheral blood leukocytes, plasma TNFalpha and IL-10, and parameters of the APACHE-II score were determined on admission. In febrile patients, SLPI was significantly increased (P < 0.001) compared with afebrile controls (63 [IQR: 50-76] ng/mL): plasma SLPI (113 [IQR: 83-176] ng/mL) was highest (P < 0.005) in patients with pneumonia compared with other groups (88 [IQR: 70-118] ng/mL). Only in patients with pneumonia, bacteremia significantly increased (P < 0.01) SLPI concentrations. Using a radiological classification of pulmonary infiltrates based on their size, it was found that plasma SLPI was proportional to the extent of lung tissue involved: the median concentration increased from 95 [IQR: 74-139] ng/mL in unilateral segmental consolidation up to 271 [IQR: 180-460] ng/mL in bilateral lobar consolidations. In a multivariate analysis, the association between SLPI and extent of consolidation was about two-fold stronger than, and independent of, the association between SLPI and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, TNFalpha, and parameters of the composite APACHE-II score, such as heart rate and blood pressure, that reflect severity of illness. SLPI is an indicator of the presence and extent of pneumonia in febrile patients admitted to hospital. In patients with an infection with its primary source located outside the lung, plasma SLPI likely reflects the mucosal response to circulating inflammatory mediators reflecting severity of illness."}

All the patients were assessed throught a predominantly non invasive diagnostic approach which included: pediatric urologic examination with aimed anamnestic and clinical freaming, functional examination of the lower urinary tract using uroflowmetry + EMG of the perineal plane muscles (UR + EMG), kidney and bladder ultrasound. This methodology has permitted a widening of the indications in the study of vesical function as well as limiting the selected cases (hight UTI, uncertain diagnosis) of mini-invasive examination, such as flow pressure study, minctional cystourethrogram (MC) and or renal scintigraphy. An MNR of the lumbo-sacral medulla (cord) and a neurological and/or neurosurgery evaluation were only carried out were there was a suspected occult neurological pathology. The clinical sintomatogy was as follows: approximately 70% of the patients suffered from partial diurnal incontinence, 42% were affected by secondary nocturnal enuresis while 58.6% suffered from recurrent UTI. In those patients with UTI, 11% (16 patients, 24 ureteral units) suffered from associated VUR while 3.5% suffered from either congenital or acquired urethral stenosis.

In total, the combination of abnormal scan with VUR occurred in 1 of 38 males (3%) and in 19 of 136 females (14%), whereas abnormal scan without demonstrable VUR was seen in 3 of 38 males (8%) versus 40 of 136 females (29%). Our data showed that the frequency of VUR in Arab Kuwaiti children with febrile UTI is midway between Caucasian and other racial groups. In this study, males had a lower-risk profile than females, the latter having a higher rate of reflux as well as a higher rate of abnormal DMSA scans, irrespective of demonstrable VUR."}

Urinary tract infection is a frequent bacterial complication after renal transplantation in adults and children, however there are only very limited data on children beyond the early post-transplant period. In this study we investigated urinary tract infections in pediatric outpatients who had received transplants more than six months previously. Incidence, risk factors and impact on short-term graft function were analyzed. 47 children who had received a total of 58 allografts were analyzed between 1997 and 2000. At the time of analysis they had had their transplants for an average of 3.5 years (range 0.5-9.4). Urinary tract infection was defined as the presence of both significant bacteriuria (> 10(5) CFU/ml) and symptoms. Of the 47 patients, 15 (32%) had from 1 to 7 urinary tract infections each. In total 35 infections were recorded. Median age at urinary tract infection was 5.5 years (range 1.8-24.2). Gender, donor source, immunosuppression and underlying disease (urologic vs non-urologic) did not influence the incidence of urinary tract infection. Creatinine but not C-reactive protein rose significantly during the infection. Our data suggest that urinary tract infection remains a frequent but mostly benign complication in the pediatric transplant population, even beyond the early post-transplant period. More extended studies are needed to assess the long-term effects on graft function."}

Most authors would agree that renal parenchymal defects (scars, hypoplasia, dysplasia) in children are a major risk factor for chronic renal failure, and for development of systemic hypertension in later years. The pathophysiologic changes in acute pyelonephritis include tubulointerstitial inflammation/pus with impairment of the renal microcirculation due to compression of the glomeruli, small peritubular capillaries and vasa recta by interstitial edema. The resulting ischemia has been postulated as one of the mechanisms for the decreased accumulation of DMSA in the areas of pyelonephritis. DMSA scanning has a sensitivity of up to 99%, and specificity of up to 91% for the detection of acute pyelonephritis. The aim of the study was to investigate the value of Tc99m-DMSA scan in children with acute urinary tract infection, to estimate the degree of parenchymal changes, and to assess the relationship with vesicoureteral reflux. We reviewed 116 infants aged 0-15 years, 100 (86.2%) female and 16 (13.8%) male, who were hospitalized for urinary tract infection during a 5-year period (1996-2000). The mean age at diagnosis was 3.7 years. Escherichia colli was isolated in 52 (44.8%) urine cultures. All patients underwent ultrasonography, which was normal in 57 (49.1%) infants. Tc99m-DMSA was performed after two weeks of therapy. The renal parenchymal pathology was defined as a focal or multifocal defect of low degree in 33 (28.4%), and of high degree in 35 (30%) children. Multifocal defects were mostly found in patients aged < 3 years, and focal lesions in those aged > 3 years. Renal scars were detected in 41 (35.3%) infants with first urinary tract infection. We recommend that ultrasound, DMSA and radionuclide cystouretherogram be routinely performed in case of first urinary tract infection in infants aged < 1 year, and voiding cystourethrogram with US and DMSA in those aged > 1 year."}

We report a case of a 63-year-old male with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and a bladder rupture caused by a spontaneous perforation of an infected urachal cyst. The symptomatology showed abdominal rigidity and pain, a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and hematuria. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis and an increased CRP level. The bladder rupture was confirmed by cystography. Bacteriologic examination identified Proteus vulgaris, Corynebacterium species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most of the published cases in the literature report about intraperitoneal perforation of infected urachal cysts. In the present case, we found a spontaneous perforation of an infected urachal cyst leading to an extraperitoneal bladder rupture with an extraperitoneal limitation of the infection. The definitive therapy was complete surgical excision including a cuff of the bladder, drainage, and systemic broad-spectrum and local application of antibiotics. The further course was uneventful."}

CT is also of value in establishing the diagnosis in equivocal cases, in evaluating high-risk patients, and in determining the nature and extent of disease. CT urography is increasingly performed as a comprehensive urinary tract imaging study. MRI may be performed when patients have contraindications to iodinated contrast material. Cortical scintigraphy is the preferred imaging study for the evaluation of children with acute pyelonephritis, although power Doppler US can be considered as a possible alternative.

In 98 (37%) patients renal lesions were verified morphologically. Lifetime renal biopsies were made for 60 of them. The diagnosis of chronic pyelonephritis was made in 117 patients, 42 patients had nephrolithlasis, nephroptosis and papillary necrosis were found in 49 and 3 patients, respectively. Arterial hypertension was present in 96 examinees, nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed in 19 and chronic renal failure--in 67 patients. Drug-related nephropathy occurred in 35 cases, in 26 cases symptoms of pyelonephritis arose prior to RA. Combination of renal diseases was found in 197 patients. Renal pathology was not verified morphologically only in 5 cases. Glomerulonephritis (GN) variants were present in 35 patients: mesangioproliferative (n = 27), membraneous (n = 5), mesangiocapillary (n = 3). 12 of them took Au preparations or D-penicillamin, therefore diagnosis of true rheumatoid GN was feasible only in 23 of them. GN was combined with renal amyloidosis (n = 28), minimal morphological changes (n = 19), interstitial/tubulointerstitial nephritis (n = 4), pyelonephritis (n = 4), arteriolosclerotic nephrosclerosis (n = 3). 41 patients with diagnosed pyelonephritis were found morphologically to have amyloidosis (n = 16), GN (n = 10), minimal morphological changes of renal tissue (n = 6), tubulointerstitial nephritis (n = 3), pyelonephritis, pyelonephritis alone (n = 4). The above morphological findings point to high occurrence of renal pathology in RA. In many cases morphological signs are more serious than clinical symptoms. If RA activity is not controlled, nephritis of any type may transform into amyloidosis. When it is impossible to formulate morphological diagnosis in RA patients, it is proposed to use the term \"nephropathy\". Unrelated to RA nephropathy's diagnosis is valid in cases when renal pathology manifested before RA.

In this study, the two techniques were performed simultaneously on a group of 64 children referred for the evaluation of VUR. DRVC detected VUR in 54/128 ureterorenal units, and VUS confirmed reflux in 44 (81%). Only in two cases was the reflux not confirmed by DRVC (97% specificity). Ten units with minimal grade I VUR detected by DRVC were not identified by VUS. For identification of grade II and III reflux, sensitivity of VUS reached 100%. Ten units with grade I VUR at DRVC presented grade II at VUS. Eleven units with grade II VUR at DRVC presented grade III at VUS. In conclusion, contrast-enhanced VUS is a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of VUR in children. Our data suggest a higher diagnostic accuracy of urosonography compared to radionuclide cystography in the determination of the grade of VUR; this may have significant consequences on the management of young patients affected by VUR."}

In total, 414 renal units with VUR 1 of different subclasses and 198 renal units without reflux were evaluated. Follow-up CRC disclosed reflux into the renal collecting system in 20% of children with VUR 1 on initial investigation, and in 23% of children with no reflux at the time of initial investigation. The probability that follow-up examination would disclose VUR 2 in 3 in renal units with different subclasses of grade 1 reflux was 8-16%, and did not differ significantly from the probability for detecting reflux in kidneys with no reflux on initial examination. In the absence of recurrent urinary tract infection, the management of children with VUR 1 identified by CRC can be the same as in children without reflux. Yet, in children with no reflux or with VUR 1 detected after urinary tract infection, the probability that reflux reaching the pylon was missed should not be underestimated. Dividing VUR 1 into subclasses does not seem to be of diagnostic value."}
{"id": "12794259", "title": "SLE and infections.", "content": "SLE and infections. Infections are common in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and remain a source of mortality. The types of infections (such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, and sepsis) in SLE patients are similar to the general population and include the same pathogens (Gram-positive and Gram-negative). SLE patients may also develop opportunistic infections, especially when treated with immunosuppressive agents. As a high-risk population, identification and treatment of chronic infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are important prior to the institution of immunosuppression to prevent reactivation or exacerbation of the infection. A common caveat is to distinguish between a lupus flare and an acute infection; judicious use of corticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs is critical in limiting infectious complications. The risk factors associated with susceptibility to disease include severe flares, active renal disease, treatment with moderate or high doses of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, and others. Genetic factors (complement deficiencies, mannose-binding lectin, Fcgamma III, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], osteopontin) may predispose certain SLE patients to develop infections. Parameters including C-reactive protein (CRP) and adhesion molecules may help to differentiate an infectious disease from an exacerbation of the disease. Finally, the mechanism of molecular mimicry by specific microbial agents may play a role in the induction of SLE."}

We used a rat kidney model to investigate the effects of gentamicin administration on functional recovery from unilateral hydronephrosis. Gentamicin was intraperitoneally injected twice for 48 hours following the release of a unilateral ureteral obstruction. The function of both kidneys was separately quantified by Technetium-99mDMSA renoscintigraphy. We examined morphological changes in renal tubular cells by electron microscopy and by in situ DNA 3'-end labeling. Renal function in the contralateral, but not the obstructed, kidney was significantly damaged by gentamicin administration under our conditions and electron microscopy confirmed the presence of myeloid bodies in renal tubular cells. In situ DNA 3'-end labeling revealed characteristic damage to the renal tubules. These results suggest that damage to each kidney should be considered individually after gentamicin administration during recovery from hydronephrosis."}

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in young children carries the risk of parenchymal damage and sequelae. The location of the infection within the urinary tract influences decisions regarding both therapeutics and follow-up. Because clinical features and laboratory markers of infection at an early age are not specific, it is difficult to make a distinction between lower UTI and acute pyelonephritis. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been studied as a marker of severe bacterial infection. The aim of this study was to test the usefulness of PCT concentration in serum to distinguish between uncomplicated UTI and severe acute pyelonephritis with renal scars. PCT was measured by immunoluminometric assay in serum samples from children with microbiologically documented infection. Severe renal involvement was assessed by 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid gammagraphy done 5 to 6 months after the episode to check for the presence of parenchymal scars. C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count were also measured. PCT at presentation showed a significant correlation (P < 0.001) with the presence of renal scars in children with UTI. Using a cutoff of 1 ng/ml for PCT and 20 mg/l for CRP, sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between urinary tract infection with and without renal damage were 92.3 and 61.9%, respectively, for PCT and 92.3 and 34.4% for CRP. Positive and negative predictive values were 32 and 97.5%, respectively, for PCT and 23 and 95%, respectively, for CRP. A low PCT value at admission indicates a low risk of long term renal scarring. Increased PCT values at admission correlate with the presence of scars. PCT values have proved to be more specific than CRP and leukocyte count for identifying patients who might develop renal damage."}

The correct diagnosis was made using postnatal ultrasonography, intravenous urography and renal scintigraphy, the last also being used for the follow-up. Four patients had poor function in the hydronephrotic kidney, treated in three by nephrectomy; 61 had normal function in the hydronephrotic kidney, with 49 followed for 1-10 years with no change in kidney function and no symptoms. Twelve patients in this group had later surgery (at 0.7-8 years old) because of pyelonephritis (four), pain and/or renal functional impairment (eight, three of whom had normal function afterward). Thirty-five patients had moderately impaired function of the hydronephrotic kidney; 29 had primary surgery at a median age of 4 months. The median hydronephrotic renal function increased from 32% before to 42% after surgery, with 15 kidneys having normal function. In one other patient the kidney was lost before surgery. Five other patients were initially treated conservatively and the hydronephrotic renal function increased from 32% to 35% at the 1-year follow-up, significantly less than in the surgical group. The overall operative complication rate was 4%. With our management programme more than half the patients can avoid surgery in childhood. Although the follow-up was intense there was moderate and irreversible functional kidney deterioration in 5%. In contrast, after successful reconstructive surgery, only a few follow-up procedures causing possible discomfort to the child are needed in most. The risk of surgical complications cannot be neglected. The present results are useful for advising parents deciding whether their antenatally detected hydronephrotic child should undergo surgery or not."}

The primary factors studied were body temperature, C-reactive protein level, white blood cell count and neutrophil ratio. The study population comprised 82 males (55.0%) and 67 females (45.0%). The mean age of the patients was 2.7 +/- 3.9 years (age range 1 day to 18 years; 75% <3 years old). Of 123 patients who underwent voiding cystourethrography, 34 (27.6%) had VUR. When raised C-reactive protein, leukocytosis and raised neutrophil ratio occurred together, the specificity and positive predictive value for predicting VUR were obviously increased, but sensitivity was radically decreased. After controlling for the other covariates, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that factors significantly related to VUR were age (odds ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.67; p < 0.05) and raised neutrophil ratio (odds ratio = 4.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1-16.5; p < 0.05). Our findings emphasize that the prevalence of VUR in children with acute pyelonephritis is extremely high. If a raised neutrophil ratio is observed, the potential risk of VUR is significantly increased in patients with clinically suspected acute pyelonephritis.

Nonetheless, ambiguity occurs when differentiating between acute pyelonephritis and chronic scarring. We report our initial experience with gadolinium enhanced inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose acute pyelonephritis. Nine patients 7 months to 18 years old (mean age 81 months) underwent MRI to confirm radiographically a clinical suspicion of acute pyelonephritis. All patients had at least 1 prior episode of clinical pyelonephritis. Data were collected to determine whether acute pyelonephritic changes could be differentiated from chronic pyelonephritis on the basis of MRI characteristics. Of the 9 patients 4 were identified as having acute pyelonephritis on MRI (persistently high signal intensity after gadolinium), 2 demonstrated evidence of postpyelonephritic scar (parenchymal loss without change in signal intensity), 1 had evidence of acute pyelonephritis and chronic changes, and 2 had a completely normal examination (decreased signal intensity after gadolinium). At our institution the billable cost of MRI to the patient is $1,329, while the billable cost of 99mtechnetium DMSA is $1,459. All patients younger than 6 years required intravenous sedation for MRI, whereas 70% of those younger than 6 years require intravenous sedation for DMSA scanning at our institution. MRI provided greater anatomical detail regarding the renal architecture without radiation exposure, and allowed the unambiguous diagnosis of acute versus chronic pyelonephritis scar in a 1-time (versus often multipart for DMSA) imaging study.

In the study group as a whole urinary IL-8 values correlated positively with peripheral blood white cell count (r = 0.32; p < 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.41; p<0.001), and C-reactive protein (r = 0.33; p<0.001). Taking the appropriate clinical situation into account, urinary IL-8 measurement helps in the non-invasive assessment of active inflammation in at least a number of common acute and chronic conditions."}

We compared the effects of sterile and infected urine on reflux nephropathy in rabbits with experimental vesicoureteral reflux. We used 2-month-old male New Zealand rabbits in this study. Group 1 (5 rabbits) served as the control, group 2 (7) was the vesicoureteral reflux plus sterile urine group and group 3 (8) was the reflux plus infected urine group. Cystography and 99mTc-dimercapto-succinic acid renal scintigraphy were performed before the reflux procedure. To create unilateral vesicoureteral reflux the roof of the right intravesical ureter was incised. Escherichia coli suspension (2 ml.), 105 E. coli in 1 ml.) was introduced into the bladder in addition to the reflux procedure in group 3. Right vesicoureteral reflux was confirmed by cystography 2 weeks after reflux. Dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy was performed at 3 weeks and the animals were sacrificed and examined. Free oxygen radical damage was investigated by measuring malondialdehyde levels in renal tissue. ANOVA and Scheffe's test were used for statistical analysis. Histopathological evaluation of the right kidney from group 2 rabbits showed mild interstitial fibrosis and mononuclear cell infiltration. The right kidney from group 3 rabbits showed apparent periglomerular fibrosis, tubular atrophy and dilatation, severe interstitial scarring and fibrosis with mononuclear cell infiltrate. There were marked histopathological changes in the right kidney of group 3 rabbits. The absolute percent dose uptake was unchanged in group 2 rabbits (p >0.05). There was significantly decreased uptake in refluxing kidneys and increased uptake in the contralateral nonrefluxing kidneys after vesicoureteral reflux in group 3 rabbits. The malondialdehyde level in the right renal tissue of group 3 was significantly higher than that in controls and in group 2 (p <0.05). The malondialdehyde level in the sterile reflux group did not differ significantly from that in the control group (p >0.05). The results of this study show that free oxygen radical damage in the presence of infection has an important role in reflux nephropathy."}

Malnutrition in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by hypoalbuminemia, decreased serum creatinine and prealbumin, and decreased subjective global assessment (SGA) scores. Markers of malnutrition predict mortality and correlate closely with inflammatory markers, including serum cytokines and acute phase proteins. After multiple regression analysis, markers of inflammation become stronger predictors of mortality than nutritional markers, suggesting that malnutrition is a result of inflammation. The etiology of inflammation is variable and includes vascular access infection, bioincompatible dialyzers, back filtration of nonsterile dialysate, periodontal disease, urinary tract infections, and other pyogenic infections. Renal failure also may serve to promote inflammation through protein carbonylation. Differences in care patterns of ESRD patients and genetics may contribute to inflammation as evidenced by lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in Asian populations. Inflammation results in loss of muscle mass and hypoalbuminemia as a consequence of its decreased synthesis and increased catabolism. Vascular disease occurs partly because of changes in lipoprotein structure and function, including oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and modification of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by serum amyloid A (SAA) and loss of apolipoprotein A-I. Leukocyte adhesion is promoted by changes in endothelial structure and function, whereas plasma proteins associated with cardiovascular disease (fibrinogen, lipoprotein[a]; SAA) are increased. Consequences of inflammation in ESRD patients include muscle wasting, erythropoetin resistance, and vascular disease. Whereas improvements in nutrition can increase serum albumin and creatinine levels, identification and removal of the underlying cause of inflammation should be one treatment goal."}

Medical and radiological records of the VUR patients (1990-2000) were examined for age, gender, mode of presentation, reflux grade and renal damage. VUR was noted in 226 siblings (352 ureters) in 107 families. Of the 119 siblings of index patients, 64 were investigated for a documented UTI and 55 with no history of UTI were detected during screening for sibling reflux.

Mild renal damage was present in 20 (21%) RRU of siblings with UTI and in 2 (2%) RRU of the screened siblings (p < 0.001). Moderate to severe renal damage was present in 5 (5%) RRU of siblings with UTI and in 4 (4%) RRU of the screened siblings (p > 0.05). This study demonstrated that the incidence of mild renal scarring was much higher in siblings who presented with UTI than in asymptomatic siblings.

To compare the efficacy of ODD of gentamicin with that of classical thrice-daily (t.i.d.) administration in infants with acute pyelonephritis. We performed a quasi-experimental study comparing 33 infants who received ODD of gentamicin with a historical control group of 25 infants treated with gentamicin t.i.d. Leukocytosis, C-reactive protein, creatinine, gentamicin dose, peak and trough values, time required for disappearance of fever, and outcome were analyzed. The mean doses of gentamicin (mg/kg/day) were higher in the t.i.d. group (6.4 1.14) than in the ODD group (5.06 0.22; p < 0.001). Peak serum gentamicin concentrations (micro g/ml) were significantly higher in the ODD group (9.32 1.4) than in the t.i.d. group (5.09 1.15; p < 0.001).

Urine samples from 40 children with acute pyelonephritis, 16 children at 6-wk follow-up and 15 children with nonrenal fever were analyzed using ELISA. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were compared with the outcome of pyelonephritis as measured by renal static scintigraphy. A mouse model of acute ascending pyelonephritis was used to localize the sites of production and the kinetics of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Human renal epithelial A498 cells, primary mesangial cells and monocytic THP-1 cells were stimulated by Escherichia coli. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and protein production by ELISA. We demonstrate a significant increase of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the urine of children with acute pyelonephritis. Both proteins were produced mainly by leukocytes, and TIMP-1 also by resident kidney cells. Cells reacted differently after stimulation by bacteria. In mesangial cells and monocytes a decreased constitutive TIMP-1 production was found, which was in contrast to epithelial cells. Out of 40 children with pyelonephritis, 23 had higher urinary TIMP-1 than MMP-9 levels. These children had significantly more severe changes in both acute and follow-up scintigraphy scans indicating higher degree of acute tissue damage and renal scarring. Thus, our findings suggest an association between TIMP-1 and the process of renal scarring."}

Renal parenchymal disease after urinary tract infection (UTI) has been associated with the development of hypertension and renal functional impairment. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed to determine how effectively the finding of primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on micturating cystography (MCU) in children hospitalized with UTI predicted renal parenchymal disease on (99m)Technetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy. Medline, Embase, and PubMed were use to find reports with original data for children hospitalized with bacteriologically-proven UTI who had undergone both MCU and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy, and which also reported both positive and negative results of these tests. A meta-analysis of likelihood ratios positive and negative for MCU was then performed, including tests for heterogeneity. Twelve valid studies were found, seven with data for 537 children, with a positive (99m)Tc-DMSA scan prevalence of 59% overall, and seven studies with data for 1062 kidneys, with a positive (99m)Tc-DMSA scan prevalence of 36%. The likelihood ratio positive for MCU was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.51 to 2.54) for children, and 2.34 (1.53 to 3.57) for kidneys. The likelihood ratio negative was 0.71 (0.58 to 0.85) for children and 0.72 (0.61 to 0.86) for kidneys. There was evidence of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis showed that a positive MCU increases the risk of renal damage in hospitalized UTI patients by about 20%, whereas a negative MCU increases the chance of no renal involvement by just 8%. VUR is hence a weak predictor of renal damage in pediatric patients hospitalized with UTI. Physicians should be aware of the limitations of using MCU-detected primary VUR as an effective screening test for renal damage in this population. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of renal damage in such patients is probably complex because it is often detected without demonstrable VUR."}

PURPOSE This study assessed the role of renal power Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) to identify acute pyelonephritis (APN) and to determine whether PDU can replace Tc-99m DMSA renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis of APN in children. METHODS A prospective study was conducted in 40 infants and young children (78 kidneys were evaluated) with a mean age of 25.9 months (range, 1 to 68 months) who were hospitalized with a first episode of high fever and bacteruria, possibly APN. All children were examined by PDU and Tc-99m DMSA within the first 3 days after admission. Patients with congenital abnormalities, hydronephrosis, and urinary reflux were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-seven of the 78 kidneys appeared abnormal on Tc-99m DMSA, and 20 of them were abnormal on PDU. Fifty-one of 78 kidneys were normal on Tc-99m DMSA, and 3 of 51 appeared diseased on PDU. The accuracy of PDU was 87%, sensitivity was 74%, and specificity was 94%. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were both 87%. When considering the numbers of lesions in 27 kidneys with positive Tc-99m DMSA studies (38 lesions), PDU did not disclose 16 lesions (false-negative results). Thus, the sensitivity of PDU for diagnosing lesions of APN decreased to 58%. CONCLUSIONS A positive PDU finding should obviate the use of Tc-99m DMSA in patients thought to have possible APN. However, because of a large number of false-negative results (26%) and underestimation of the number of pyelonephritic lesions (low sensitivity of 58%), PDU cannot replace Tc-99m DMSA in the diagnosis of APN in children."}

Study design Untreated patients (n = 61) with renal scars associated with recurrent urinary tract infection and vesico-ureteric reflux were investigated and compared with 904 healthy controls. A significant positive correlation between the extent of renal scarring and systolic and diastolic BP standard deviation score (SDS) was found by using ABPM. Mean systolic day-time BP SDS in ABPM was significantly elevated in girls with renal scars compared with healthy controls, but failed to be significant in boys. Mean systolic and diastolic night-time BP SDS were significantly elevated in patients. Compatible with these results, diastolic dipping was significantly lower in patients compared with controls. The increase in BP obtained by ABPM is positively correlated with the degree of scarring in our group of patients. Elevated night-time BP might be the most sensitive indicator of BP elevation in these children."}

The present study prospectively enrolled young children with diagnosis of their first febrile urinary infection who underwent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinate renal cortical scintigraphy within 120 h of initiation of treatment. Patients with abnormal renoscintigraphy received antibiotics for 2 weeks and scintigraphy was repeated 1 year later. Twenty-two children were enrolled from July 1995 through March 2000. Acute-phase renoscintigraphy identified focal defects in 0 of the 14 children who were treated within 24 h of the disease, 1 of the 3 treated in 24-48 h, and 2 of the 5 treated in 48-72 h. Repeat renoscintigraphy showed disappearance of the focal defects in all 3 children. The present study has shown that early treatment within 24 h of onset of the fever due to urinary infection should deter renal changes. Fever for more than 24 h prior to diagnosis indicates a high risk for renal changes and needs an immediate effective treatment to avoid renal damage."}

Some authors have suggested that the DD genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene would be an adverse renal prognosis factor. We recruited 246 patients (aged 3 months to 22 years) from four Spanish hospitals. These included 69 patients with VUR, 110 with RN (determined by absence/presence of renal scarring on dimercaptosuccinc acid scan), 27 with chronic renal failure due to RN, and 40 patients (control group) with urinary tract infection and normal findings on renal ultrasonography and voiding cystoureterogram. The ACE I/D, angiotensin II type 1 receptor AT1 A1166C, angiotensin II type 2 receptor A3123C AT2, and angiotensinogen AGT M235T polymorphisms were determined on the basis of polymerase chain reaction amplification. ACE serum levels were determined by spectrophotometric methods. We found no statistical differences in the distribution of RAS polymorphisms between the different groups. The ACE D allele was linked to higher ACE serum levels. We found no association between ACE I/D polymorphism and presence of hypertension, proteinuria, grade of VUR, or unilateral/bilateral VUR. Patients with the DD genotype had a lower incidence of febrile urinary tract infection as a first symptom of VUR/RN (P<0.05). We conclude that genetic polymorphisms of RAS components are not independent prognostic indicators of renal scarring in patients with VUR."}

We proposed that CD40L expression might be correlated with coronary artery lesions in KD. Blood samples were collected from 43 patients with KD before intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment and 3 days afterward. Forty-three age-matched febrile children with various diseases were studied in parallel as controls. CD40L expression on T-cells and platelets were detected by flow cytometry, and soluble CD40L (sCD40L) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that CD40L expression on CD4(+) T-cells was significantly higher in patients with KD than in the febrile control (FC) group (28.69 +/- 1.17% vs 4.37 +/- 0.36%). CD40L expression decreased significantly 3 days after IVIG administration (28.69 +/- 1.17% vs 13.53 +/- 0.55%).

More interesting, we found that in KD patients, CD40L expression on CD4(+) T-cells and platelets but not on CD8(+) T-cells or sCD40L was correlated with the occurrence of coronary artery lesions. CD40L might play a role in the immunopathogenesis of KD. IVIG therapy might downregulate CD40L expression, resulting in decrease of CD40L-mediated vascular damage in KD. This implicates that modulation of CD40L expression may benefit to treat KD vasculitis."}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate bladder function in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) by means of indirect radionuclide cystography (IRNC), and to investigate whether IRNC can identify those children with voiding dysfunction. The study enrolled 74 neurologically intact children, 14 boys and 60 girls aged 2-14 years, with VUR documented using contrast micturating cystourethrography as the initial method. In all patients, IRNC was performed using technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetate (DTPA). Based on the urodynamic findings, three groups were distinguished: a group with VUR and normal urodynamic findings ( n=27), a group with VUR and detrusor hyper-reflexia ( n=43) and a group with VUR and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( n=4). A control group comprised 64 healthy children, aged 2-13 years, without any symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction. The dynamics of bladder emptying were studied in the posterior view after intravenous injection of 37 MBq/10 kg b.w. DTPA, with acquisition of 90 2-s frames during voiding. The parameters evaluated were: voided urine volume (VV), bladder capacity, functional bladder capacity (FBC), residual urine, voiding time, average flow rate, peak flow rate (PFR) and ejection fraction (EF). With regard to the final urodynamic diagnosis, FBC, PFR and EF were found to be significant IRNC predictor variables using the logistic regression method. If abnormality on at least two of the three significant predictor variables was taken as the criterion of voiding dysfunction, the overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of IRNC in the detection of voiding dysfunction were 81%, 78% and 80%, respectively. Three radionuclide voiding patterns were detected in children with VUR: (1) a normal voiding pattern characterised by normal FBC with near-normal PFR and EF values, (2) a markedly reduced FBC with significantly reduced VV, PFR and EF values (in children with bladder instability), and (3) a higher bladder volume with a near-normal value for PFR and a slightly reduced or near-normal EF (in children with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia). This study confirmed the association between lower urinary tract dysfunction and congenital VUR. IRNC was found to be a simple, non-invasive method which allows reliable differentiation of voiding patterns in patients with VUR. IRNC can be used as a first-line method for screening in children with VUR to identify those with abnormal voiding patterns."}

We investigated whether imaging studies altered management or improved outcomes in young children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. In a prospective trial involving 309 children (1 to 24 months old), an ultrasonogram and an initial renal scan were obtained within 72 hours after diagnosis, contrast voiding cystourethrography was performed one month later, and renal scanning was repeated six months later. The ultrasonographic results were normal in 88 percent of the children (272 of 309); the identified abnormalities did not modify management. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 61 percent of the children (190 of 309). Thirty-nine percent of the children who underwent cystourethrography (117 of 302) had vesicoureteral reflux; 96 percent of these children (112 of 117) had grade I, II, or III vesicoureteral reflux. Repeated scans were obtained for 89 percent of the children (275 of 309); renal scarring was noted in 9.5 percent of these children (26 of 275). An ultrasonogram performed at the time of acute illness is of limited value. A voiding cystourethrogram for the identification of reflux is useful only if antimicrobial prophylaxis is effective in reducing reinfections and renal scarring. Renal scans obtained at presentation identify children with acute pyelonephritis, and scans obtained six months later identify those with renal scarring. The routine performance of urinalysis, urine culture, or both during subsequent febrile illnesses in all children with a previous febrile urinary tract infection will probably obviate the need to obtain either early or late scans."}

To gain new insights into the epidemiology, imaging and conservative management of urinary tract infections based on the peer-reviewed literature of the last year. It has been estimated that 3% of prepubertal girls and 1% of prepubertal boys are diagnosed with urinary tract infections. Breastfeeding has been shown to offer significant protection against urinary tract infection in infants. Any young child with an acute pyelonephritis should be evaluated by dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan to confirm or rule out renal scarring. The voiding cystourethrogram can be performed within the first 7 days of diagnosis. Amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalosporin are the first-line antibiotics to treat children with uncomplicated urinary tract infection. The incidence of urinary tract infections during infancy and childhood is high and influenced by the age and sex of the patient. Voiding cystourethrogram and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan are required for imaging. Short-course treatment is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections."}

Infants younger than 1 year old with primary vesicoureteral reflux were recruited from 14 hospitals during the 3-year registration period beginning in January 1996 and ending in December 1998. Various clinical parameters as well as renal parenchymal lesion on dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy were evaluated. Of 356 infants enrolled 296 (83%) were male and 60 (17%) were female. In 85% of infants presenting symptom was febrile urinary tract infection. There were 204 bilateral (57%) and 152 unilateral (43%) cases. Reflux was bilateral in 56% of males versus 65% of females, and high grade (grades IV and V) in 58% of males versus 55% of females. Diffuse parenchymal lesion was similarly noted in infants with or without prior urinary tract infection (38% and 46%, respectively) and was more often noted in male than in female infants (42% versus 25%). Despite the current use of screening prenatal ultrasound, many infants are still diagnosed as having vesicoureteral reflux only after the occurrence of urinary tract infection. The greater severity of renal parenchymal lesion in male infants combined with similar incidence of diffuse parenchymal lesion in those with or without prior infection suggests preexisting congenital abnormalities in the male refluxing kidney."}

Two control groups consisted of patients with valvular heart diseases: 15 without infection and another 15 with urinary tract infection. The diagnosis of IE was established according to the Duke University criteria; in 34 patients positive blood cultures were found. Serum IL-6 and CRP were measured on three occasions after diagnosis of IE was established and during antimicrobial treatment (mean period 14 +/- 7 days) by ELISA. Usefulness of both parameters for IE diagnosis were described. Reference values were defined as 0-12.5 pg/ml for IL-6, and 0-10 mg/l for CRP. Mean concentrations of IL-6 and CRP in patients with IE (37 +/- 44.3 pg/ml and 27.1 +/- 23.9 mg/l) were significantly higher than in controls: with urinary tract infection (9.1 +/- 4.42 pg/ml and 6.95 +/- 4.39 mg/l) and without infection (3.95 +/- 1.4 pg/ml and 2.21 +/- 0.96 mg/l).

Patients were classified according to CRP value (0-50, 51-100, 101-150, > or = 151 mg/l) and type of infection. The prevalence of hypophosphataemia was calculated for each group. 30 children with hypophosphataemia on admission had serial measurements of serum phosphate and CRP levels. A significant negative correlation between serum phosphate and CRP levels was found (r = -0.41, p < 0.0001). Patients with CRP > or = 151 mg/l on admission had a lower mean serum phosphate value than those with CRP < or = 50 mg/l (1.17 vs 1.50 mmol/l, p < 0.0001). The overall prevalence of hypophosphataemia for patients with pneumonia, upper respiratory tract bacterial infection, urinary tract and viral infections was 45%, 35.7%, 18% and 4.4%, respectively. Hypophosphataemia occurred during the phase of rising of CRP level and resolved soon after CRP reached a plateau. In conclusion, hypophosphataemia is a relatively frequent but transient phenomenon in children with acute infectious disease. It is associated with an increase in CRP concentration and resolves before the normalization of CRP levels."}

We prospectively studied 10 adult male patients who had community acquired prostatitis and compared them with six male patients who had urinary tract infections but without prostatitis. An initial urinary culture and two blood cultures were carried out for each patient. All patients were followed up for 8 weeks after therapy was completed. Pre- and post-treatment scintigraphies were performed. Before treatment, all patients with prostatitis showed uptake of ILLs in the prostate area. After the patients had completed treatment with antibiotics, the scintigraphy results showed no uptake in the prostate area in 9/10 patients. The remaining patient showed a marked decrease in the uptake of ILLs. None of the six patients with urinary tract infection showed ILL uptake in the prostate region. It is suggested that ILLs could be useful for detecting acute prostatitis, especially in clinically ambiguous patients with urological infections.

Renal parenchymal damage may already be present at birth before any episode of urinary tract infection or acquired after a febrile urinary tract infection. We evaluate the incidence of renal damage in a large series of male infants with high grade vesicoureteral reflux diagnosed after the first urinary tract infection.

For multivariate analysis risk factors, such as gender, age at diagnosis, history of urinary tract infection, reflux grade and ACE genotype, were analyzed in logistic regression model. Renal parenchymal damage was detected in 45 (28%) of the 162 siblings. Multivariate analysis revealed that reflux grade (p <0.0001), history of urinary tract infection (p = 0.010) and age at diagnosis (p = 0.044) were the most significant independent risk factors for renal parenchymal damage.

Informed consent was obtained for the withdrawal of an additional 1-mL aliquot of blood for use in CRP evaluation. Logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were modeled for each predictor to identify optimal test values, and were compared using likelihood ratio tests. Two hundred fifty-six patients were included in the analysis, with a median age of 15.3 months (range, 3.1-35.2 months) and median temperature at triage 40.0 degrees C (range, 39.0 degrees C-41.3 degrees C). Twenty-nine (11.3%) cases of occult bacterial infection (OBI) were identified, including 17 cases of pneumonia, 9 cases of urinary tract infection, and 3 cases of bacteremia. The median white blood cell count in this data set was 12.9 x 10(3)/ micro L [corrected] (range, 3.6-39.1 x10(3)/ micro L) [corrected], the median absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 7.12 x 10(3)/L [corrected] (range, 0.56-28.16 x10(3)/L) [corrected], and the median CRP level was 1.7 mg/dL (range, 0.2-43.3 mg/dL). The optimal cut-off point for CRP in this data set (4.4 mg/dL) achieved a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 81% for detection of OBI in this population. Comparing models using cut-off values from individual laboratory predictors (ANC, white blood cell count, and CRP) that maximized sensitivity and specificity revealed that a model using an ANC of 10.6 x10(3)/L [corrected] (sensitivity, 69%; specificity, 79%) was the best predictive model. Adding CRP to the model insignificantly increased sensitivity to 79%, while significantly decreasing specificity to 50%. Active monitoring of emergency department blood cultures drawn during the study period from children between 3 and 36 months of age showed an overall bacteremia rate of 1.1% during this period. An ANC cut-off point of 10.6 x10(3)/L [corrected] offers the best predictive model for detection of occult bacterial infection using a single test. The addition of CRP to ANC adds little diagnostic utility. Furthermore, the lowered incidence of occult bacteremia in our population supports a decrease in the use of diagnostic screening in this population."}

Relationship of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), urinary tract infection (UTI) and subsequent renal scarring nowadays is still in question. This study aimed to determine 1) the incidence of cortical scarring in Thai children presenting with upper urinary tract infection, 2) the association between VUR with acute pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring, 3) the use of DMSA and direct radionuclide cystography (DRNC) scintigraphy in children with UTI. Sixty newly diagnosed UTI children underwent DRNC and Tc-99m DMSA renal cortical scintigraphy at the time of first UTI diagnosis and 6 months later. There were no significant differences of age, sex, type of antiobiotics and pathogens (E. coli vs non-E. coli) between those who did and did not develop scars (p>0.05). 58/98 of 1st DMSA abnormal kidneys (59.18%) developed scars. 60.20 per cent of 98 positive 1st DMSA had VUR while 80.33 per cent of 61 with VUR had positive 1st DMSA. 59.02 per cent of these 61 kidneys developed scars. Scar occurrence were 18.7 times in high grade VUR compared to low grades. In conclusion, there was a high incidence of acute pyelonephritis in the presence of VUR but acute pyelonephritis does not necessarily need VUR for its development. High grade reflux with upper UTI, is a strong indicator for renal scarring. Children presenting with UTI, irrespective of age, sex, or pathogen, should have both DMSA and DRNC scintigraphy performed to identify upper UTI and high risk patients who will develop subsequent renal scarring."}

We reviewed the records of 95 infants, who were hospitalised with UTI during a 6-year period (1994-1999). Patients with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and incomplete radiological investigations were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 57 patients, 42 were boys and 15 girls. The mean age at diagnosis was 32 days (range 5-60 days). All patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and (99m)Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Urinary tract abnormalities were detected in 20 (35%) patients. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was found in 19 (33%) neonates, 7 girls and 12 boys. Acute cortical defects on DMSA scan were present in 19 kidneys of patients with VUR and in 25 of those without reflux. Only one-third of neonates after first symptomatic UTI had VUR. We recommend that US, VCUG, and DMSA scan should be routinely performed after the first UTI in infants younger than 8 weeks."}

The pathogenesis of renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children is multifactorial. In addition to well-known risk factors (young age, high grade of vesicoureteral reflux, P-fimbriated Escherichia coli, and treatment delay), a role for genetic predisposition has been suggested. Since the ACE gene deletion polymorphism is a known risk factor for progressive glomerulosclerosis in chronic renal diseases, we have investigated the relationship between the ACE genotypes and the development of renal scarring after APN. Fifty-nine children (43 males and 16 females) with APN diagnosed by urine culture and technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99)Tc-DMSA) renal scan were studied. ACE genotypes were determined as II, ID, and DD using the polymerase chain reaction technique. A follow-up (99)Tc-DMSA renal scan was performed to evaluate the development of renal scars 3-6 months after treatment. The distribution of ACE genotypes and the allele frequencies were compared in the renal scar-positive ( n=39) and -negative group ( n=20). ACE genotype frequency after stratification by risk factors was also evaluated. The distribution of ACE genotypes did not differ between the renal scar-positive (II 25.9%, ID 35.9%, DD 28.2%) and -negative group (II 35.0%, ID 45.0%, DD 20.0%), before and after stratification by each risk factor. ACE gene deletion polymorphism did not affect the development of renal scar as an independent variable in children with APN."}

Accurate determination of glomerular filtration rate can be obtained by means of an intravenous injection of Cr-51 EDTA and one or two blood samples. Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy is an accurate method for evaluation of regional cortical impairment during acute pyelonephritis and later on, for detection of permanent scarring. Tc-99m MAG3 renography is nowadays a well-standardized method for accurate estimation of the split renal function and of renal drainage with or without furosemide challenge. This technique is particularly indicated in uni- or bilateral uropathies with or without renal and/or ureteral dilatation.

In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels and compared these with other commonly used inflammatory markers. We evaluated the ability of serum PCT levels to predict renal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte counts, and PCT levels were measured in 64 children admitted for suspected UTI. Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 7 days after admission. In acute pyelonephritis, the median PCT level was significantly higher than in the lower UTI group (3.41, range 0.36-12.4 microg/l vs. 0.13, range 0.02-2.15 microg/l, P<0.0001). In these two groups, respectively, median CRP levels were 120 (range 62-249 mg/l) and 74.5 (range 14.5-235 mg/l, P=0.012) and leukocyte counts were 15,910/mm(3) (range 10,200-26,900) and 14,600/mm(3) (range 8,190-26,470, P=0.34). For the prediction of acute pyelonephritis, the sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 94.1% and 89.7%, respectively; CRP had a sensitivity of 100%, but a specificity of 18.5%.

Although relationship between vesico-ureteric reflux, urinary tract infection and renal scarring is known, pathogenesis of the renal scarring is still unclear. Vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract infection remain in very close relationship, they may also occur separately. The factor promoting renal injury is also young age of a child. The aim of this paper was to analyse the influence of the selected factors, namely: degree of the vesico-ureteric reflux; child's age at reflux diagnosis time as well as the frequency of recurrences of urinary tract infections exerted on reflux nephropathy. In 45 children with diagnosed vesicoureteric reflux the intensity of renal scarring was estimated using planar scintigraphy with DMSA-Tc-99m and a questionnaire was prepared. The questionnaire included information as follows: age at which the diagnosis was established, degree of reflux at the time of diagnosis, treatment applied, frequency of urinary tract infections before and after having taking medical care of children. It was revealed that the degree of scarring correlated with degree of vesico-ureteric reflux of particular kidney. In the investigated group no correlations were found between intensity of renal scarring and both the age of establishing diagnosis and frequency of urinary tract infections before starting the treatment. Taking the obtained results into consideration it seems, that the degree of vesico-ureteric reflux estimated prior to treatment determines degree of renal injuries though, undoubtedly all factors being studied affect renal scarring."}

The foregoing finding and the risk of major life-threatening complications prompted surgical treatment. Pathological analysis showed pyonephrosis of left kidney. X-ray, ultrasound and abdominal CT showed left renal lithiasis, an enlarged left kidney, poor cortico-medullary differentiation and parenchymal destructuring with areas suggestive of cortical abscesses. A Ga-67 citrate scintiscan showed a notable intensity that completely affected the left renal parenchyma with no other changes. On the other hand, Tc-99m DMSA showed no uptake in the left kidney and normal uptake in the right kidney. A left nephrectomy was performed.

Uristatin is a trypsin inhibitor present in urine that is increased in most patients with bacterial or viral infections and in many with inflammatory disorders. We included the assay of uristatin as part of a screening program carried out by pediatricians on 4207 Japanese schoolchildren to judge the ability of uristatin to identify those with an infection and (or) inflammation of any cause. We used urine dipsticks for the assay of uristatin, creatinine, albumin, blood, leukocyte esterase, and protein. We also performed quantitative assays for uristatin and creatinine. Another aim was to estimate the reference range for uristatin in schoolchildren, ages 5 to 14 yr. We prepared dipstick pads that were impregnated with a chromogenic substrate for trypsin and measured the uristatin-caused inhibition of trypsin in urine. We measured creatinine so that the ratio of uristatin to creatinine could be calculated to correct for urine concentration. We obtained quantitative uristatin and creatinine results for 4207 children. Of these, 177 had an abnormal urine dipstick for albumin or blood or protein or leukocyte esterase or a combination of these. We used data from 3622 children to establish the reference range for the uristatin dipsticks. The 3622 were diagnosed by their pediatricians as free from an infection or inflammation of any cause and with normal urine dipstick tests. We recommend an upper reference limit for uristatin by dipstick of < or = 7.5 mg uristatin/g creatinine. The leftover 408 children ( [4207-3622-177] = 408) fell into two groups: 205 with diagnoses of no infection, possible infection, or possible inflammatory disorders. The remaining 203 children were renal disease follow-up cases. The diagnoses were based on a physical examination, microscopic urinalysis plus urine dipstick tests for albumin, blood, creatinine, protein, leukocyte esterase and a complete blood count. In the 205 children, 46 had an abnormal uristatin dipstick test, 39 had an abnormal uristatin by immunoassay, 41 had an abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 27 had an abnormal serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and one had an abnormal urine microscopic exam. For the first 938 children in the study, the agreement was 93% of negative dipstick uristatin results and immunoassays. The agreement of positive uristatin dipsticks with immunoassays was 85%. We assumed that the immunoassay results were correct. In the evaluation of 189 children with fever, 62 also had an abnormal uristatin by dipstick. A rapid dipstick test for uristatin read on a reflectance photometer gave values that compared well with a quantitative immunoassay method. The uristatin test is sensitive but not specific for any cause of infection or inflammation. Uristatin is easy to determine and appears to be a better indicator than fever, ESR, or CRP for the diagnosis of an infection or inflammation."}

The correlation between urinary tract infection (UTI), vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and renal scarring was studied in 89 patients (177 renal units; 1 solitary kidney) during the period 1997-2000. There were 63 males and 26 females; ages ranged from neonates to 14 years. UTI was diagnosed on the basis of a positive urine culture, VUR was diagnosed and graded by micturating cystourethrogram (MCU), and renal scarring was assessed by technetium 99 m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Ultrasonography (US) was done to evaluate renal tract dilatation and other structural abnormalities. A follow up DMSA scan was performed approximately 6 months after the initial scan. VUR was present in 106 of the 171 renal units in which it was studied and absent in 65 units. The majority of the VUR was grade V. Renal scars were seen in 90 of 177 renal units at presentation and in 72 of the 163 renal units studied at follow-up. Some information was lacking in 31 patients; hence, the correlation between UTI, VUR, and renal scarring was done in 58 patients. The majority of the suspected scars at presentation were not seen at follow-up, but most of the established scars persisted. Only 2 renal units showed scars for the first time on follow-up. On US, approximately 50% of normal kidneys showed either suspicious or established scars on DMSA scan, and patients with bilateral abnormality on US showed renal scars. Renal scars were seen in 15 of 23 children without VUR, 17 of 18 with unilateral VUR, and 16 of 17 with bilateral VUR. Thus, there is a cause-and-effect relationship between UTI and renal scarring that is made worse by VUR. DMSA scans have been shown to be the most reliable method of assessing renal scarring, and an abnormal US scan showing upper-tract dilatation or a structural abnormality may have a predictive value in the detection of renal scarring."}

Infants with history of antenatal hydronephrosis and neonatal vesicoureteral reflux may have detectable changes in renal scans before the advent of urinary tract infection. In cases of bilateral high-grade vesicoureteral reflux, differential renal function on renal scan may not reveal renal hypoplasia since comparison of relative function may be made between two abnormal kidneys. We tested the hypothesis that ultrasonography in the neonatal period may be accurate and complementary to renal scan in detecting renal hypoplasia at birth. Twenty-six infants who presented in the antenatal period with history of hydronephrosis and were noted to have neonatal vesicoureteral reflux postnatally were studied retrospectively. They had all been treated by a prospective protocol that included renal ultrasound and renal scans in the first 6 weeks of life. All had been placed on prophylactic antibiotics and had no urinary tract infection. Multiple sonographic parameters were analyzed including kidney length, echogenicity, calyceal blunting, parenchymal thinning and focal scars. We correlated the renal morphology on ultrasound, the renal function on renal scan and the degree of reflux seen on VCUG. VCUG showed reflux in 44 renal units, grade of reflux was: I (2), II (7), III (12), IV (8), and V (15). A variety of nucleides were used including DMSA in 15, DTPA in 6 and MAGIII in 5. Renal scans identified global hypoplasia without focal scars (differential function less than 40%) in 10 of 44 refluxing renal units grades I (1), III (2), IV (4), and V (3). The sonographic finding of decreased renal length (<50th percentile for age) was present in 14 refluxing units of 44 refluxing renal units, grade I (1), grade III (4 bilaterally in 1), grade IV (4 bilaterally in 1), and grade V (5 bilaterally in 2). The sonographic finding of decreased renal length (<50th percentile) correlated strongly with renal hypoplasia on renal scans in refluxing renal units (p value <.005, sensitivity 80% and specificity 82%, positive predictive value 57%, and negative predictive value 93%). Postnatal ultrasonography is a reliable measure of gross renal parenchyma, and in the presence of vesicoureteral reflux correlates with renal scintilligraphy.

Discitis (inflammation of the intervertebral disk) most commonly develops as a rare complication of bacterial infection or chemical or mechanical irritation during spine surgery (1) with a postoperative incidence of 1%-2.8% (2). It is also a complication of discography-the intradiscal injection of saline or contrast material (3). The incidence of postdiscography discitis is 1%-4% (3); no cases have been reported when prophylactic antibiotics have been used, supporting the theory of bacterial contamination (3). Although it is controversial whether discitis can be caused by an aseptic or infectious process, recent data suggest that persistent discitis is almost always bacterial (4). Honan et al. (5) reported 16 cases of spontaneous discitis and reviewed another 52 patients from the literature. In their series, patients tended to have one or more comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, vertebral fracture, or a preexisting spine injury. Spontaneous discitis has also been associated with advanced age, IV drug abuse, IV access contamination, urinary tract infection, and immunocompromised states (5,6). No cases of infectious discitis associated with pregnancy and spinal anesthesia have been reported in the English literature. Discitis presents as spasmodic pain in the back that may be referred to the hips or groin (7). The pain may radiate to the lower extremities. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually increased. Radiological changes in discitis include narrowing of the intervertebral disk space, vertebral sclerosis, and erosion of the end plates. The best diagnostic measure may be magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a combination of bone and gallium scanning (2). The mainstay for discitis treatment is pain control and antibiotics; surgical intervention is usually not required.

The lower thorax and upper abdomen are visualized during cardiac acquisition of rest Tl-201 and stress Tc-99m tetrofosmin gated SPECT. Thus, abnormal Tl-201 localization in these areas and in organs such as parts of the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys can be observed, including rotating raw cine data. Other than cardiac images, the authors retrospectively reviewed Tl-201 rotating (raw data) images of 235 patients. Abnormal findings in the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys were identified that correlated with the patients' clinical information; radiographic findings, including computed tomography and ultrasonography of the abdomen; other scintigraphic studies; and laboratory findings. In 53 patients, 54 abnormalities were detected. Intrathoracic abnormalities included focal areas of increased uptake, one in the right lower lung and another in the right upper lung that confirmed lung cancer, in 2 patients; diffuse uptake in both lungs in 11 patients; photopenia in the lung bases, which had resulted from pleural effusions, in 3 patients; and abnormal right liver configuration caused by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm in 1 patient. Of the intra-abdominal abnormalities, 12 patients with splenomegaly were identified. Six patients had focal areas of increased uptake in the gastric area. Nonvisualization of one kidney resulted from a congenitally absent right kidney in 1 patient, from right nephrectomy in 1 patient, from end-stage renal disease in another, and from a lower position of the left or right kidneys in 5 patients. Small and decreased uptake of both kidneys resulted from end-stage renal disease in 1 patient. Small and decreased uptake of one kidney was noted in 1 patient with renal scarring, in 1 patient with a renal stone, in 3 patients with chronic pyelonephritis, and in 5 patients with renal cyst(s). Discernible intrathoracic and intra-abdominal abnormalities using rotating raw cine data from imaging in three-dimensional displays include diffuse or focal pulmonary uptake, pleural effusion, elevation of a hemidiaphragm, splenomegaly, increased uptake in the gastric area, renal abnormalities including absent or small kidneys, end-stage renal disease, renal scarring, renal cyst(s), and lower position of a kidney. The incidental finding of such abnormalities may prompt further clinical investigation."}

Fifty-seven children (mean age, 5 +/- 3 y) with acute pyelonephritis were investigated by biologic testing, DS (DS 1), and DMSA (DMSA 1). Patients who were <6 mo old or had high-grade reflux or obstruction were excluded. Forty-five children had a clinical follow-up examination, biologic testing, DS (DS 2), and DMSA (DMSA 2) at a mean of 7 +/- 2 mo after acute infection. Sonography (gray-scale and DS) was performed by 1 experienced radiologist who was unaware of patient data. DMSA studies were interpreted by 2 physicians who were unaware of patient data. Temperature, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein value were significantly higher in patients with abnormal DMSA 1 findings than in those with abnormal DS 1 findings (P < 0.05). When compared with DMSA 1, DS 1 had a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 81%, respectively. At follow-up, all clinical and biologic data had normalized. Scarring after infection occurred in 51% of children. When compared with DMSA 2, DS 1 had positive and negative predictive values of 57% and 75%, respectively, and DMSA 1 had respective values of 62% and 100%. Reflux was not considered a good predictor of scarring. DS and DMSA results were concordant in 81% of kidneys with acute pyelonephritis. The predictive value of DS for renal scarring was not considered sufficiently high for DS to be used in routine practice."}

Accurate diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) using clinical and laboratory parameters is often difficult in children. The aims of this retrospective study were twofold. Firstly, to correlate the clinical and laboratory manifestations of APN with the results of the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan in different age groups. Secondly, to compare the DMSA renal scan, renal ultrasonography (RUS), and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in patients with clinical APN. The DMSA renal scan was utilized as the gold standard for renal involvement. We determined the sensitivity of these tests in febrile urinary tract infections (UTI) in three age groups: group I less than 2 years; group II 2-8 years; group III older than 8 years. During the period January 1992 through December 1998, 222 children presented with a febrile UTI. All patients had a DMSA renal scan, 208 had contrast VCUG, and 163 had RUS. The clinical and laboratory manifestation of pyelonephritis correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan in the older children than in the younger children; 85% of the DMSA renal scans were positive in group III; 69% in group II; 48% in group I (P<0.001). Vesicoureteral reflux detected by contrast VCUG was more prevalent in the younger age groups. Although high grades of reflux (grade IV-V) correlated better with a positive DMSA renal scan, it did not reach a level of statistical significance (P>0.05). RUS did not correlate with a positive DMSA renal scan in any age group."}

The aim of imaging in urinary tract infection is to detect conditions that must be treated in order to avoid immediate deterioration or recurrences, and probable long-term kidney damage. In newborns identified with hydronephrosis during pregnancy or by neonatal screening, vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring are congenital and not caused by infection. Most of these patients are male and the vesicoureteral reflux is of a higher grade than that detected in girls having had urinary tract infection. In children with urinary tract infection, several authors advocate a more selective policy and recommend imaging only in those children who are at risk for developing renal damage. In adult females no imaging is necessary in cystitis, whereas ultrasonography and plain films are recommended in acute pyelonephritis. Because uncomplicated urinary tract infection in men is rare, diagnostic evaluation including imaging should be started early in order to rule out complicating factors within the urinary tract. The role of imaging in prostatitis, vesiculitis, epididymitis and orchitis is primarily to rule out abscess formation, but also to exclude testicular malignancies."}

Evaluation of bacterial etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, drug management and imaging studies. The purpose of the study was to investigate the management of pyelonephritis in a large Italian pediatric population. A total of 1,333 patients (36% male) were considered. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (89.9%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (3.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (2.1%). 27% of microorganisms were resistant to amoxicillin, 4% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 11% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 2.4% to gentamicin and less than 2% to ceftazidime. Despite this resistance pattern showing that oral antibiotics, such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, are effective in vitro as well as parenteral antimicrobials, a parenteral antibiotic was given initially to 756 (57.2%) children. A prophylactic regimen was started in 922 patients with a rate of reinfection during prophylaxis of 9.5%; a higher rate of reinfection was observed in patients with reflux (25%) compared to children without reflux (3%) (p < 0.0001). Vesicoureteral reflux was demonstrated in 30% of patients. The number of renal abnormalities detected by DMSA in patients with and without reflux was significantly different (p < 0.001). CRP was higher in patients with scars (p < 0.02). In conclusion, pyelonephritis represents a common disease with about 2,500 days of hospitalization per year in the Veneto Region where there is a pediatric population of about 800,000 under 15 years of age. The results of antimicrobial in vitro tests indicate that amoxillicin/clavulanic acid could represent the antibiotic of choice. The high frequency of malformations, observed even in children between 6 and 12 years of age, may suggest the need of an imaging study including DMSA scan and VCUG in all age groups."}

Steroids, used in preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM), to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality of the preterm neonate, impair the maternal polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-based immune system. In spite of combination with antibiotics, prenatal and postnatal bacterial infections of mother and child are frequent. This pilot study focuses on the influence of steroids in pPROM on maternal PMN functional capacity and subsequent infections. After opting for expectant management, eight women with pPROM and no signs of infection were treated by steroids (betamethasone 5.7 mg, i.m. every 24 hours, for three days) and antibiotic therapy with either amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, piperacillin or ampicillin i.v. up to delivery. The conventional inflammation parameters of PMN blood count and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured daily in parallel with PMN migratory capacity towards N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine stimulation and under blank conditions, estimated by a whole blood membrane filter assay. In all patients PMN migration decreased during the application of steroids. Three patients showed a decrease in PMN migration below critical values and in spite of antibiotic prophylaxis acute pyelonephritis developed 2-6 days later. PMN count and CRP were not predictive of maternal infection. Reduced PMN function, caused by steroid treatment in pPROM, is suggested to be a reason for serious bacterial infections in spite of antibiotic prophylaxis. PMN migration reflects individual PMN defensive capacity."}

Vesicouretheral reflux was detected in four patients and required surgical intervention in one. One patient had considerable renal scarring and decreased renal function on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In children with suspected serious bacterial infection, it is important to have the possibility of renal infection in mind in spite of normal urine findings.

Serious bacterial infection included bacterial meningitis, sepsis, bacteraemia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bacterial gastroenteritis, osteomyelitis and ethmoiditis. Using multivariate logistic regression and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC area), the diagnostic value of predictors for serious bacterial infection was judged, resulting in a risk stratification. Twenty-five percent of the 231 patients enrolled in the study (mean age 1.1 y) had a serious bacterial infection. Independent predictors from history and examination included duration of fever, poor micturition, vomiting, age, temperature < 36.7 degrees C or > or = 40 degrees C at examination, chest-wall retractions and poor peripheral circulation (ROC area: 0.75). Independent predictors from laboratory tests were white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein and the presence of >70 white blood cells in urinalysis (ROC area: 0.83). The risk stratification for serious bacterial infection ranged from 6% to 92%.

Febrile children presenting to a pediatric emergency department (ED) with ages ranging from 1 to 36 months, temperatures > or =39 degrees C, and clinically undetectable source of fever were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Demographic information, ED temperature, duration of fever, and clinical evaluation using the Yale observation scale were recorded at the time of the initial evaluation. The white blood cell count (WBC), band count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and CRP concentration were measured at the same time. All patients received blood cultures and either a screening urinalysis or urine culture. A chest radiograph was obtained at the discretion of the ED physician. Patients with history of using antibiotics within 1 week of their presentation to the ED were excluded. The main outcome result was the presence of laboratory or radiographically proven SBI (bacteremia, meningitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis). Seventy-seven patients were enrolled in the study. Fourteen (18%) had a SBI (6 urinary tract infection; 4 pneumonia, including 1 patient with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia; and 4 occult S pneumoniae bacteremia), and 63 had no SBI. The 2 groups were indistinguishable in age, sex, ED temperature, duration of fever, and Yale observation scale. CRP concentration, WBC, and ANC were significantly different between the 2 groups. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only CRP remained as a predictor of SBI (Beta = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.89). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated CRP (area under curve [AUC] 0.905, standard error [SE] 0.05, 95% CI: 0.808, 1.002) to be superior to ANC (AUC 0.805, SE 0.051, 95% CI: 0.705, 0.905) and to WBC (AUC 0.761, SE 0.068, 95% CI: 0.628, 0.895).

General analysis and radiology was made to all of them including renal arteriography as gold standard. Two renal scintigraphies with 99mTc-DMSA were made to all of them, baseline study and one hour after administration of 50 mg of captopril, a week between both studies. Renal scintigraphy (anterior and posterior images) was obtained 4 hours after the administration of 111 MBq (3 mCi) of 99mTc-DMSA and results were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively calculating unilateral renal function. We considered positive for renovascular hypertension studies with decrease of more than five percentual points in unilateral renal function or a new defect absent in baseline study. Scintigraphic results were compared with arteriography to determine sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Arteriography demonstrated significant renal artery stenosis in 18.5% of patients.

Urinary tract infections are common in infants and children. Pyelonephritis may result in serious complications, such as renal scarring, hypertension, and renal failure. Identification of the timing of release of inflammatory cytokines in relation to pyelonephritis and its treatment is essential for designing interventions that would minimize tissue damage. To this end, we measured urinary cytokine concentrations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and IL-8 in infants and children with pyelonephritis and in healthy children. Children that presented to our institution with presumed urinary tract infection were given the diagnosis of pyelonephritis if they had a positive urine culture, pyuria, and one or more of the following indicators of systemic involvement: fever, elevated peripheral white blood cell count, or elevated C-reactive protein. Urine samples were obtained at the time of presentation prior to the administration of antibiotics, immediately after completion of the first dose of antibiotics, and at follow up 12 to 24 h after presentation. IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Creatinine concentrations were also determined, and cytokine/creatinine ratios were calculated to standardize samples. Differences between pre-antibiotic and follow-up cytokine/creatinine ratios were significant for IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 (P < 0.01). Differences between pre-antibiotic and control cytokine/creatinine ratios were also significant for IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 (P < 0.01). Our study revealed that the urinary tract cytokine response to infection is intense but dissipates shortly after the initiation of antibiotic treatment. This suggests that renal damage due to inflammation begins early in infection, underscoring the need for rapid diagnosis and intervention."}

Amyloidosis, glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis were diagnosed in 5 (5.3%), 16 (17%), and 13 (13.8%) patients, respectively. The above renal lesions were concurrent in some patients. Renal lesion correlated with the progression and severity of RA, the presence of systemic manifestations, and age. There was no relationship of both 5- and 10-year use of NSAID to the symptoms of renal disease. The use of these drugs for over 10 years was concurrent with the signs of chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension. Analyzing immunological disorders showed an association of increased erythrocytic sedimentation rates and WF:Ag with amyloidosis, that of higher IgA concentrations with proteinuria and tubular dysfunctions. It is concluded that renal lesion is common in RA, there is a predominance of tubular interstitial changes. In rare cases nephropathy is characterized by a benign course and fails to result in uremia. The symptoms of renal diseases are largely associated with RA progression and severity and the patients' age. Prolonged continuous use of NSAID may contribute to the development of renal failure. Different immune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of glomerular and tubular nephropathy in RA."}

Upon interaction with activated endothelium, monocytes and neutrophils form complexes of myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8) (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9), two members of the calcium-binding S100 family that are secreted during transendothelial migration. In a pilot study of 20 renal transplant recipients and a validation study of 36 renal transplant recipients, MRP8/14 serum levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 28 d, associated with C-reactive protein and creatinine serum levels, and grouped according to biopsy-proven acute rejection. Serum levels of MRP8/14 but not C-reactive protein were significantly increased for several days during the first 2 wk for the acute rejection groups in both studies (P < 0.005, on day 6 after transplantation). As determined by using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal cutoff for 100% specificity and high sensitivity (67%) for acute rejection on day 6 after transplantation was calculated to be 4.2 microg/ml for MRP8/14 in the pilot study; this value was confirmed in the validation study. Positive MRP8/14 serum levels preceded acute rejection episodes by a median of 5 d. A 3-d course of intravenous methylprednisolone therapy reduced prerejection MRP8/14 serum levels from 5.7 microg/ml to 3.3 microg/ml (P < 0.05). All MRP8/14 serum levels were below the cutoff during urinary tract infections, delayed graft function, or cytomegalovirus infections, and these values did not differ significantly from control values. It is concluded that the MRP8/14 complex is a very early serum marker suitable for monitoring of acute rejection with high sensitivity and specificity."}

This prospective study, performed in 101 children with a first symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), evaluates the diagnostic value of clinical, biological, and ultrasound parameters in detecting children with acute renal infection documented by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. In children with a positive DMSA scan, mean C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher than in children with a normal DMSA scan (114+/-64 vs. 67+/-38 mg/dl, mean+/-SD, P=0.0002). The sensitivity and specificity of CRP was 64% and 68%, respectively. In children with severe kidney involvement, mean CRP and white blood count (WBC) were higher than in children with mild/moderate disease (151+/-83 vs. 92+/-55 mg/dl for CRP, P=0.0149; 20,100+/-6,854 vs. 15,023+/-6,145 WBC/ mm3 for WBC, P=0.0131). The sensitivity and specificity was 85% and 20% for CRP, and 77% and 18% for WBC, respectively. One or more areas of abnormal cortical echogenicity were documented in 3% of kidneys with positive DMSA scans. Dilatation of the collecting system was observed in 24% of kidneys. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography was 27% and 89%, respectively. In conclusion, clinical, biological, and ultrasound parameters do not accurately distinguish cystitis from pyelonephritis in children with UTI and do not identify children with severe renal damage. Accordingly, we recommend that DMSA scan should be added to the initial work-up of children with UTI."}

Ventricular fibrillation followed by asystole occurred soon after admission. The suddenness of the patient's death did not allow time for further investigation and therapy. The severity of the clinical signs was probably related to a massive release of catecholamines because of necrosis of the tumour, which may have been worsened by the diagnostic procedures performed to investigate the clinical symptoms and signs of acute pyelonephritis."}

Dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scans and voiding cystourethrography were performed in all cases. Patients were followed for 2 to 16 years, including 90% for greater than 3 years. Renal ultrasound and DMSA scan were done at followup. A total of 97 patients (76%) (148 refluxing renal units) presented clinically with urinary tract infection. The initial DMSA scan demonstrated renal scarring in 40 of the 106 grade IV (38%) and 28 of the 42 grade V (67%) refluxing renal units. There was no scarring on followup in previously normal refluxing renal units. Of the patients 30 (24%) (46 refluxing renal units) were diagnosed before a urinary tract infection developed, 16 underwent screening due to vesicoureteral reflux in a sibling and in 10 reflux was initially suspected due to hydronephrosis on prenatal ultrasound. In the remaining 4 patients vesicoureteral reflux was suspected during abdominal ultrasound to investigate abdominal pain, jaundice, associated hypospadias and fetal alcohol syndrome, respectively. DMSA scan showed evidence of scarring in 6 of 21 grade IV (29%) and 9 of 25 grade V (36%) refluxing renal units in this group. Followup revealed scarring in only 1 previously normal refluxing renal unit. The incidence of reflux nephropathy in primary grade V vesicoureteral reflux is lower in cases detected by screening and with treatment it remained lower than in cases of urinary tract infection that presented clinically. Early treatment of grade V vesicoureteral reflux made possible by screening may prevent renal damage."}

Few topics in pediatric urology engender such vigorous debate as the who, when, how, and why related to the investigation of pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs). Further controversy stems from management of the underlying pathology. This article first discusses the patient characteristics that are important in the evaluation of pediatric patients with UTIs, and the indications for screening tests (such as voiding cystourethrograms, ultrasound, dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy, and intravenous pyelography). Following this, the author reviews what is known about three controversial aspects about the management of these patients. First, although the role of the prepuce in pediatric UTI is well established, the role of routine circumcision is not. Second, the natural history and etiology of antenatally detected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has provoked us to view the concept of \"primary reflux\" in a new light. Third, although the way to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux is generally agreed upon, the utility of our surgical management in view of long-term follow-up is less clear."}

All patients aged 6 weeks to 15 years suspected of acute pyelonephritis (APN) were admitted to the Paediatric Department and underwent Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy within 3 days after admission and at 6 months. Of 166 patients enrolled in the study, 15 (9%) had negative or equivocal urine culture despite clinical and scintigraphic evidence of APN. Of these 15 children, renal ultrasound was normal in 7 patients and vesicoureteric reflux was found in 9 patients. Control DMSA 6 months after acute episode showed the disappearance of cortical lesions in eight and partial improvement in four patients. In this prospective series, as many as 9% of patients with APN would have been missed on the basis of equivocal or negative urine cultures.

Prospective survey of febrile children aged less than 36 months who presented to the emergency departments of the participant hospitals and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 937 cases were collected. Of these, 43 were excluded because of absence of blood culture and 151 because the patients had not undergone obligatory monitoring until they became afebrile or had no final diagnosis. Consequently, the sample size consisted of 743 patients. Clinical assessment was very important to detect patients with potentially serious bacterial disease. Among the laboratory parameters, a white blood cell count above 15,000/l or below 5,000/l and elevated C-reactive protein levels were the most useful. Urinary tract infection was the most frequent invasive disease. Neisseria meningitidis was the most frequent microorganism isolated in the blood culture.

To assess the value of renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) in predicting functional recovery after the surgical relief of obstructed kidneys in children. Patients and methods Forty-three children underwent surgery to relieve upper urinary tract obstruction; 37 had pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction and six had vesico-ureteric junction obstruction. The indication for surgery was a combination of an obstructed renogram with symptoms of either pain or pyelonephritis. Most children (41) had < 40% function on the affected side before surgery, with just two having hyperfunction (> 55%). In all patients intravenous urography before surgery showed hydronephrosis, and a micturating cystogram was used to exclude coexisting reflux in the presence of an associated megaureter. Diuretic renography (using 99mTc-mercaptoacetyl triglycine or 123I-hippuran) and DMSA scintigraphy were both carried out before surgery and the renography repeated 6 months afterward. The renographic drainage curves improved from obstructed to unobstructed or 'dilated unobstructed' on all postoperative studies. Regression analysis showed that preoperative DMSA scan was an excellent predictor of outcome (P < 0.001) whilst the preoperative renogram was a relatively poor predictor of the functional result. In four patients where the initial renographic function was < 10%, DMSA scintigraphy predicted correctly the capacity for recovery in three and the inability to improve in the fourth. Conclusion Before surgery, DMSA scintigraphy in children with upper urinary tract obstruction is a more useful estimate of probable long-term renal function than value from diuresis renography. If there is doubt about the desirability of reconstructive surgery, a DMSA scan may eliminate the need for more invasive methods of estimating recovery, e.g. a period of nephrostomy drainage."}

We assessed the risk for the occurrence of renal damage in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). We reviewed the records of 187 consecutive children, aged 3.8 +/- (SD) 2.8 years, with unilateral primary VUR diagnosed after urinary tract infection (UTI). Dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scintigraphy was performed 4 to 6 months after the last UTI. Three patterns of renal damage were identified: global reduction (GR) of renal radionuclide uptake (20% to 40% of relative uptake), focal defects (FD) in uptake, and shrunken (relative uptake <20%) kidney (SK). We assumed that in these subjects FD indicated postpyelonephritic damage and that GR indicated congenital renal damage. Scintigraphic renal damage of any type was present in 36.9% of the refluxing and in 3.2% of the nonrefluxing kidneys (odds ratio [OR], 17.6; 95% CI, 7.4 to 41.9). FD were present in 15.5% and 2.7% (OR, 6.7; CI, 2.5-17.6), GR in 19% and 0.5% (OR, 44.3; CI, 6.1 to 327.2), and SK in 6.9% and 0%, respectively. Patients with severe VUR showed a higher probability of renal damage than those with nonsevere VUR.

Determination of the left to right dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake ratio is theoretically one of the easiest quantitative procedures in nuclear medicine. The quantification can be performed on the posterior view, with or without the lateral view for correction of kidney depth. The geometric mean can also be determined using both the anterior and the posterior views. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of remarkable differences in the results from quantification of the relative renal function using the geometric mean and those obtained using the posterior counts only. Moreover, we evaluated to what extent the patient age influenced these differences. We reviewed 328 99Tcm-DMSA scans. The difference between the relative renal function obtained using the posterior view and that obtained using the geometric mean was calculated and analysed statistically. For the purpose of evaluating the value of performing the geometric mean calculation in patients of different ages, patients were divided into four age groups (group I, < or =2 years; group II, 3-9 years; group III, 10-18 years; group IV, >18 years). Using the Student's t test, no statistical differences were found in the relative renal function obtained by the two methods (posterior projection and geometric mean) in groups I (t = 0.01, P = 0.992) and II (t = 1.43, P = 0.155), which consisted of patients younger than 10 years (77% of the patients). In groups III and IV statistical differences were found (t = 2.27, P = 0.028 and t = 2.170, P = 0.038), respectively.

A retrospective, single-institution study was made of Hong Kong Chinese children aged less than 5 years with a documented UTI investigated by both micturating cystourethrography and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy. VUR was identified in 39% of 93 Chinese children with UTI. Renal scarring was present in 28% of boys, which is comparable with published data on Western children. Scarring appears to be less common in Chinese girls with UTI (11%) than in Western girls (30-38% from published data), and its severity is poorly related to VUR grade. There is a significant dependency relationship between grade of VUR and degree of scarring in Chinese boys (p < 0.05). In conclusion, renal scarring appears to be relatively uncommon in Chinese girls. The correlation between grade of VUR and degree of scarring in Chinese boys suggests a relationship, but provides no evidence about the direction of causation."}

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem in children. Because clinical findings and commonly used blood indices are nonspecific, the distinction between lower and upper urinary tract infection cannot be made easily in this population. However, this distinction is important because renal infection can induce parenchymal scarring. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) compared with C-reactive protein (CRP) rapid tests to predict renal involvement in children with febrile UTI. PCT and CRP were measured in the blood of children admitted to the emergency room with fever, signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection and/or a positive urine dipstick analysis. Renal parenchymal involvement was assessed by a 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan in the acute phase of infection in all children. Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were determined for both tests. Fifty-four children with a proven urinary tract infection were enrolled: 63% had renal involvement; and 37% had infection restricted to the lower urinary tract. No difference was found for age, sex and total white blood cell count between the groups. The calculated likelihood ratios of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein rapid tests were between 3.8 and 7 and 1.5 and 2.8, respectively. A positive PCT value predicted renal involvement in 87 to 92% of children with febrile UTI, compared with 44 to 83% using CRP values.

The kinetics and role of urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) in liver surgery are unclear. We investigated the effects of preoperative liver function and the extent of liver resection on postoperative UTI synthesis in the liver after partial hepatectomy. Sixty-one consecutive patients who underwent liver resection were the subjects of the study. Plasma and urine UTI, plasma C reactive protein (CRP) and plasma and urine creatinine were measured perioperatively. Although the average plasma UTI level did not change significantly, the average urine UTI level per day showed a change similar to that of the average plasma CRP level, reaching a maximum of approximately eight times the preoperative level on the second postoperative day (86,610 +/- 53,109 U/day). The maximum postoperative increase in urine UTI excretion per day (delta-uUTImax) correlated significantly with the maximum increase in CRP and the increase in creatinine clearance. Multiple regression analysis revealed that delta-uUTImax was significantly and positively correlated with the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate and operation duration, and negatively correlated with the resection rate. The postoperative urine UTI level may reflect preoperative liver function and the extent of liver resection after partial hepatectomy."}

The author's goal was to create a system to identify children at risk for development of progressive renal damage. Thirty-four children were examined with Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy in the acute stage of an initial episode of pyelonephritis, after 6 months, and again after 1 year. The scintigraphic findings were correlated with clinical and laboratory data. All children had parenchymal defects in the acute stage: 93% of the kidneys and 85% bilaterally. After 6 months, the defects had diminished or disappeared in 66% of the kidneys. New defects appeared in 22%. At 1 year, no further improvement was seen in the kidneys, with an improved or unchanged pattern at 6 months. New defects appeared in 34%. Mean kidney activity uptake expressed as the percentage of administered dose (KU/AD), was low in the acute stage, increased at 6 months, with no further significant increase at 1 year. Eighty-three percent of children with urine cultures growing > or = 104 bacteria/ml at follow-up had decreased KU/AD values, whereas all children with urine cultures growing < 104 bacteria/ml had increased KU/AD values. Quantitative assessment increases the sensitivity of Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy. Follow-up with this method makes it possible to identify the children with decreasing renal tubular function who may be at risk for progressive renal damage. Moderate bacteruria of 104 bacteria/ml urine is associated with deterioration of renal tubular function."}

An open, randomized, controlled trial comparing OD with three times daily (TD) gentamicin dosing in hospitalized children ages 1 month to 12 years with UTI. Daily doses (milligrams per kg per day) of gentamicin in both groups were 7.5 (<5 years old), 6.0 (5 to 10 years old) and 4.5 (>10 years old). There were 179 children enrolled (90 OD, 89 TD). Baseline clinical characteristics and pathogens were similar, except that circulatory compromise and renal cortical scintigraphic defects were more common in the OD group. Median gentamicin treatment durations were 3.0 (OD) and 2.7 (TD) days. Mean peak gentamicin concentrations were 17.3 (OD) vs. 6.4 (TD) mg/l; 99% of peak concentrations were >7 mg/l in the OD group whereas 16% of peak concentrations were <5 mg/l in the TD group. Mean trough concentrations were 0.35 (OD) vs. 0.55 (TD) mg/l. In the OD group 4% of trough concentrations were > or = 2 mg/l, whereas in the TD group only 0.7% were > or = 2 mg/l. Age or prior elevated peak concentrations did not predict high trough concentrations. Population pharmacokinetic modeling of the data fitted a one-compartment model with first order elimination. There were no clinical or bacteriologic failures. The two disease-related complications were confined to the OD group. No nephro- or ototoxicity was identified. With age-appropriate dosing and measurement of serum trough concentrations before the second dose, OD gentamicin is safe and effective for the treatment of UTI requiring parenteral treatment in children aged 1 month to 12 years."}

To assess urodynamic studies of children with nonrefluxing pyelonephritis, investigate the possible connection between renal damage (as approximately 40% of children with febrile urinary tract infections and no evidence of vesico-ureteric reflux have irreversible renal cortical scarring) and lower urinary tract dysfunction, to test the hypothesis that bladders with high storage and voiding pressures may be the cause of renal damage in these patients. The clinical records and urodynamic studies of 52 children (46 girls and six boys, mean age 6.6 years) with febrile urinary infections, no evidence of reflux and photopenic areas on renal scintigraphy were evaluated retrospectively. Each child was evaluated by urinary ultrasonography, a voiding cystogram, 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan and urodynamic studies. The storage phase of the urodynamic study was divided into two equal segments to consider the filling variables of each. During the emptying phase, voiding pressures and voiding pressures with reference to peak detrusor contraction were evaluated. Despite no child having reflux, the DMSA scans showed bilateral renal scarring in 39 (75%) and unilateral scarring in the remaining children. Forty-eight (93%) children had abnormal urodynamic values: high filling pressures (34), high-pressure uninhibited contractions (32), high voiding pressures (31) and discoordinated voiding (28). The cystometric bladder capacity was lower than the expected bladder capacity (- 75 mL) in 82% of the patients; in only four patients were the urodynamics considered normal. Most children with renal scarring and no reflux had lower urinary tract dysfunction. Common findings include high storage and voiding pressures, and discoordinated voiding. These findings suggest that abnormal bladder dynamics play a role in the development of renal scars that occur in the absence of reflux."}

The radionuclide cystograms were interpreted as showing the presence or absence of VUR and the DMSA scan as symmetrical or asymmetrical differential function, with or with no renal defect. Fifty-five families gave informed consent, of whom 46 completed the study (eight refused secondarily and one was omitted by exclusion criteria), representing 46 symptomatic patients and 65 siblings. There were 17 siblings with VUR (26%) including two of 13 infants and 15 of 52 children aged > 18 months. One radionuclide cystogram failed. Of the 17 refluxing siblings, four had a history of symptomatic urinary tract infection; 62 of the 65 siblings had a DMSA scan, of which 56 were normal and six (10%) showed abnormalities (five asymmetrical differential function and one parenchymal defect). Only one of these six patients had VUR at the time of the evaluation and only one had a small kidney detected by ultrasonography on one side (and no VUR). There were no adverse effects associated with screening. This study confirms a significant overall incidence of VUR (26%) in the asymptomatic siblings of patients treated for primary VUR. From the results of the DMSA scan (only one sibling had a parenchymal defect), the systematic screening of asymptomatic siblings does not appear to be beneficial."}

All children without bacterial evidence of UTI and children previously investigated for antenatal urological anomalies, major congenital anomalies, or UTI were excluded. A total of 164 children (51 boys, 113 girls) were included. Thirteen of 56 infants (23%) and 82/108 older children (76%) were diagnosed at home over one year. The prevalence of dilatation on ultrasound was 8%, renal scarring on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was 11%, and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was 34% when investigations were carried out following guidelines published by the Royal College of Physicians. In children aged 1-6 years, the prevalence of scarring was 1/54 (2%) in those treated at home and 6/18 (33%) in inpatients. The low yield of positive results and lack of evidence of impact on management indicate that DMSA scanning, with all the implications of isotope exposure, intravenous injection, staff time, psychological trauma, and expense, could be omitted in children over 1 year with first simple UTI not sufficiently ill to be admitted to hospital.

Three months after surgery, persistent mild reflux was found in eight of 76 treated renal units. Kidney uptake at 5-year follow-up was unchanged in the majority of children, indicating preservation of renal function found at baseline. The split renal function showed an excellent correlation (r = 0.99) between baseline and follow-up studies (regression slope 1.01). Percentage uptake had a regression slope of 0.89 significantly different from unity (P<0.05). Empirical kidney-depth correction techniques were compared.

Twenty-three renal transplant recipients with recurrent urinary tract infection were investigated simultaneously by RVC and USVC. After catheterization, the empty bladder was filled with normal saline (mean 250+/-30 ml) and 30-45 mBq of (99m)Tc-labelled colloid. At the end of filling the bladder, 19.5 ml of galactose-based, microbubble-containing echo-enhancing agent, at a concentration of 200 mg/ml, was instilled. During the filling and voiding phases the movement of the radiotracer was recorded by a gamma camera and the presence of microbubbles in the urinary tract by ultrasound. RVC was used to detect and grade the degree of VUR. Nuclear studies identified VUR in 16 (69.6%) of 23 recipients with recurrent urinary tract infection: VUR grade I in three (13%) recipients, grade II in eight (34.8%) and grade III in five (21.7%) using a simplified grading system. USVC with contrast-enhancement detected VUR in 14 (60.9%) recipients. Overall sensitivity and specificity of contrast-enhanced USVC was 75 and 71%, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the accuracy of this procedure increased with higher grades of VUR and its sensitivity reached 100% for detection of VUR grade III.

The analysis of results gained from imaging examinations in children with AP was based on the comparison of used techniques and the assessment of their exploitation for the diagnosis of AP. 38 children (17 girls and 21 boys at average age of 11.6 years) with clinical criteria of AP were subdued to ultrasonographic examination with B record (US-B) and ultrasonographic examination with energetic Doppler (US-D). Both methods were compared with the findings gained by use of renal scintigraphy 99mTc DMSA. The positive finding of AP was proved in 36 children (94.7%). The results of US-B proved AP in 14 children (36.8%) of the whole group of patients, i.e. in 38.8% with positive DMSA finding. US-D changes indicated AP in 15 children (39.4%) of the whole group, i.e. in 41.6% with positive DMSA finding. The sensitivity of both methods US-B and US-D appear to be low for the verification of changes in renal parenchyma in AP. Despite its advantages and availability, the gain from ultrasonographic examination in children suffering from AP is small. Clinical and laboratory criteria are fully sufficient for AP verification in common clinical practice. DMSA scintigraphy is a method of choice in complicated cases of AP. (Tab. 1, Ref. 17.)"}

We retrospectively examined 93 children (47M/46F) with primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) followed for a mean period of 3.5 years. They were divided into two groups. Group A included 34 babies (25M/9F) with a prenatal diagnosis of pelvic dilatation. Mean age at presentation was 12 days and no urinary tract infection (UTI) occurred before our first examination. VUR was unilateral in 21 (62%) patients and bilateral in 13 (38%). It was mild (grades I-III) in 12 (25%) refluxing renal units (RRU) and severe (grades IV-V) in 35 (75%). Renal damage (RD) was present, at diagnosis, in 40 (85%) RRU. There was a greater prevalence of abnormal kidneys in male units (88%) than in female units (75%). Group B included 59 infants (22M/37F) less than 1 year old with UTI. The mean age at first examination was 7.6 months. VUR was unilateral in 32 (54%) infants and bilateral in 27 (46%), mild in 60 (70%) RRU and severe in 26 (30%). At diagnosis, 54 (63%) RRU presented RD, which was more common in females (66%) than in males (44%). Our study confirms that primary VUR associated with prenatal hydronephrosis usually affects males and is severe. VUR diagnosed after UTI, instead, is more common in females and is frequently mild. Although in the first type of reflux RD is often present at diagnosis, then probably congenital, it may always progress after UTI; hence the importance of early diagnosis and careful follow-up in each infant with primary VUR."}

Diuretic 99mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) dynamic scintirenography has been applied in the evaluation of kidney function and structure, frequently to exclude obstruction. However, in children and adults with a clinical picture of APN, diuretic MAG3 scintigraphy with zero time injection of furosemide (MAG3-F0) was observed to display focal parenchymal abnormalities; regional dysfunction (focal parenchymal decrease in early uptake; slow filling in and prolonged late retention of activity); or, less frequently, fixed defects. This observation was further studied both retrospectively and prospectively, and its sensitivity and specificity for APN were compared with those of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In the retrospective study, for 36 children with UTI and regional parenchymal findings on MAG3-F(0), data were reviewed, analyzed, and compared with the results of concurrent DMSA studies. In the prospective study, for 57 children with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of APN, the 2 radiopharmaceuticals were used for imaging sequentially and the results of the 2 studies were compared. The criteria for abnormal findings compatible with the diagnosis of APN were, for MAG3-F(0), regional parenchymal dysfunction and fixed focal defects and, for DMSA, focal defects without parenchymal loss. In all groups of patients, most abnormal MAG3-F(0) studies (80%) showed regional parenchymal dysfunction, but in some (20%) a fixed defect was found. Compared with DMSA and when both regional dysfunction and focal defects were considered, MAG3-F(0) was as sensitive as DMSA. Some patients had only MAG3-F(0) abnormalities, suggesting a slightly lower specificity for MAG3-F(0) compared with DMSA (86%); this finding needs further study, because it also raises questions about the sensitivity of DMSA, considering that only a small percentage of patients with clinically suggestive findings had abnormal study findings. In most patients with fixed defects on both DMSA and MAG3-F(0), follow-up studies showed no resolution, suggesting that a fixed defect on MAG3-F(0) may indicate either more severe APN or preexistent scars and that regional dysfunction may be a sign more specific for APN and prognostic of potential recovery. In addition, a pattern more specific for a scar--a fixed defect with a dilated regional calyx--was seen on follow-up MAG3-F(0). A fast (25-min) planar dynamic MAG3-F(0) study was found to be as sensitive at depicting focal parenchymal abnormalities in APN as was the 3- to 4-h DMSA routine procedure. The sensitivity and specificity of both studies need further evaluation."}

Infectious diseases are a common cause of increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients and present a frequent problem in the geriatrician's daily practice. Infections in the elderly are quite different from infections in a younger population. These differences are due to Age-related alterations in immunology Different epidemiology and bacteriology Increased morbidity and mortality Altered clinical presentation Concommittant disability and comorbidity in many older patients Different approaches to therapy. This article is an attempt to discuss these various aspects of infectious disease in the elderly. The most important infections in the elderly are caused by bacteria. Incidence and bacterial spectrum depends on the site of infection and whether the patient is hospitalized, living in a nursing home or in the community. Pneumonia, UTI and pressure ulcer infections are more frequent in patients living in nursing homes than in community dwelling older people. Infections are a frequent cause of hospitalization in elderly people and hospitalization on the other hand is a risk factor for life-threatening nosocomial infections, caused by invasive diagnostic procedures and frequent use of urinary and venous catheters. Infections in the elderly are often accompanied by serious complications as bacteriemia (pneumonia), frequent recurrence (UTI), perforation and abscess (abdominal infections) and severe disability (pressure ulcer infections). Because of these serious and frequent complications mortality of infections is higher in older patients than in younger people. Elderly patients with infectious disease often present in the same way as younger patients do. Many elderly however present with non-specific clinical symptoms and non-specific functional decline which makes an accurate diagnosis difficult and may lead to a life-threatening delay of diagnosis and therapy. In older patients with unexplained functional decline, physicians must be aware of the possibility of a serious infection. Moreover, the physician can not rely on typical signs of infections as fever. In the elderly the fever response is often blunted even in the presence of bacteremia. Leokocytosis may be absent and elevation of acute phase protein is a more reliable marker of infection than elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Clinical suspicion of bacterial infection in elderly patient should prompt Careful anamnesis and clinical investigation Hospitalization if necessary Diagnostic procedures without delay including blood cultures Immediate empiric antibiotic therapy taking into account the site of infection, if the infection is community acquired or nosocomial and the most likely bacterial spectrum and local resistance factors. The use of broad spectrum antibiotic substances with a low side effect profile and pharmacokinetic properties which are suitable for elderly patients."}

Postnatal investigation of mild degrees of fetal hydronephrosis has allowed subsequent detection of infants with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). This study was designed to provide short to medium term information on such infants who had primary VUR, the rates of renal damage and progression over time, the risk factors for such damage and to compare the characteristics of those who had mild dilatation of the fetal renal pelvis (4-9 mm) with those who had moderate-severe dilatation (> or = 10 mm). Since June 1989, infants whose antenatal sonography had identified a fetal renal pelvis with an anteroposterior diameter of > 4 mm were investigated postnatally with renal ultrasonography and micturating cystourethrogram (MCU), and placed on antimicrobial prophylaxis. Those with VUR received 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Infants were followed until discharge based on resolution of VUR, surgery, or low grade VUR. A 5.5 year cohort between June 1989 and December 1994 formed the study population. A review of notes and clinical review (if still under follow up) was undertaken. Vesicoureteric reflux on MCU was regraded according to the International Classification, and reflux nephropathy on DMSA scans was regraded according to criteria proposed by Goldraich. Regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for renal damage. There were 69 infants (37 girls, 32 boys) who were identified with primary VUR, with 37/69 having bilateral reflux. Eight had a urinary tract infection during the follow-up period. There was a broad distribution of grades of reflux detected (Grades I-3, Grades II-23, Grades III-19, Grades IV - 17, Grades V-7). 99m-Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans on 57/69 (83%) demonstrated renal damage in eight infants (14%). This was predominantly global contraction of function. No progression of renal damage was seen over 2-7 years. Regression analysis showed a strong association between Grades IV, V reflux and the presence of renal damage (P < 0.001). Review of the degrees of fetal renal pelvic dilatation showed that 60/69 infants were detected because of mild (4-9 mm) dilatation. The majority (43/60) had lower grades of reflux (Grades I, II, 3), but there was no obvious cut-off between 4 and 9 mm that could predict high grade VUR (Grades IV, V). The use of 4 mm to define an abnormal fetal renal pelvis allows a much larger group of infants with high grade primary VUR to be detected than if a higher cut-off measurement is used. Although it also detects many more infants with low grade primary VUR, there is no obvious cut-off point at which this effect predominates. Progressive renal damage was not seen in follow up of up to 7 years of age. Renal damage on DMSA scanning in this group is almost exclusively a pattern of global contraction of function. The presence of high-grade VUR appears to be the only important factor in predicting the presence of renal damage."}

Primary vesicoureteral reflux is a predisposing factor for urinary tract infections in children. The first-choice technique for the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux is voiding cystourethrography, followed by cystoscintigraphy; cystoscintigraphy, however, has the advantage of only minor irradiation of the patient, but it does not allow the morphological evaluation of bladder and vesicoureteral reflux grading. Colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast is a recently introduced method for imaging vesicoureteral reflux. The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of colour-Doppler cystosonography with echocontrast in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Twenty children (11M, 9F) aged between 0.4 and 4.9 y underwent colour-Doppler cystosonography using a diluted solution of Levovist (Schering, Germany), after filling up the bladder with saline. In all patients, vesicoureteral reflux diagnosis and grading had been performed previously by voiding cystourethrography within 5 d from ultrasonography. Our data showed high accuracy in the detection of medium to severe vesicoureteral reflux (grades III-V), confirmed by radiological features in 9/9 patients. Conversely, in the 11 patients with mild vesicoureteral reflux (grades I-II), this technique showed extremely low sensitivity, allowing diagnosis in only four cases. Colour-Doppler cystosonography, because of the absence of ionizing radiations, has great advantages, particularly in patients needing prolonged monitoring. Despite experiences reported in the literature, this technique has a role in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux. Our group chooses colour-Doppler cystosonography for the follow-up of medium-severe grade vesicoureteral reflux already diagnosed by radiology and/or scintigraphy. Cystoscintigraphy is employed only to confirm cases resulting negative at ultrasonography."}

Bushi, one of the components of Mao-bushi-saishin-to, is a complex of various alkaloids, which is known to stimulate the conducting system of the heart, so half of the standard dose was prescribed for these patients. We assessed changes in the patients' body temperatures and serum C-reactive protein concentrations. As a result, the patients' body temperatures all fell to under 37 degrees C and C-reactive protein levels decreased from an average of 3.06 mg/dl to an average of 0.36 mg/dl (P< 0.02). In cases where a fever does not decrease through dosage of an antibiotic such as ofloxacin after about 3 days, half of the standard dose of Mao-bushi-saishin-to for 7 days should be considered as a complementary therapy."}

The maternal serum of IL-6 and TNF-alfa levels were evaluated in patients with PROM between 24-34 weeks of pregnancy (the study group, n = 45). The control group consisted of healthy pregnancy (n = 41) at 24-34 weeks of gestation. Serum cytokines concentrations were measured by commercial available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

The practice parameter consists of 11 recommendations and four areas for future research. Recommendations 1 through 5 address diagnosis and emphasize the need for culturing appropriately collected specimens; diagnosis should not be based on urinalysis or on culture of specimens from urine-collection bags. Recommendations 6 through 10 address treatment, identifying trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as superior to amoxicillin and establishing the duration of treatment as seven to 14 days. Children should receive antimicrobial coverage until imaging studies have been completed. Recommendation 11 addresses imaging; all infants should undergo ultrasonography, and a lower tract study is strongly encouraged as well. Future research should quantitatively address the relationship between renal scarring in childhood and renal impairment and hypertension in adults. Less invasive methods of diagnosis and imaging are highly desirable and should be developed."}

Twenty patients admitted to the hospital for hepatic resection were equally randomized to one of two groups: the UTI group, those who were administered perioperative UTI, and the control group. The UTI group had no adverse effects from using UTI. Production of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) tended to be attenuated in the UTI group when compared with the control group. Moreover, the UTI group had significantly decreased positive acute-phase C-reactive protein (p < 0.05) and significantly increased negative acute-phase protein prealbumin and retinol-binding protein (p < 0.05). Serum IL-6 levels significantly correlated with serum C-reactive protein levels on postoperative day 1 (r = 0.70, p < 0.01). These results suggest that perioperative administration of UTI might deserve further assessment for use in modulating acute-phase responses without adverse effects in patients who have undergone hepatic resection."}

We determined the incidence and associated characteristics of renal abnormalities using 99mtechnetium(Tc) dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy in infants with high grade vesicoureteral reflux but no history of urinary tract infection. We retrospectively reviewed the results of 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy and renal ultrasonography performed during the first 6 months of life in infants with vesicoureteral reflux detected during the postnatal evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis or sibling reflux screening. Those with a history of urinary tract infection, or evidence of ureteropelvic junction or bladder outlet obstruction were excluded from study. Of the 28 male and 6 female infants who met study criteria vesicoureteral reflux was bilateral in 25 and unilateral in 9. Reflux grade was IV or V, II or III and I in 38, 18 and 3 of the 59 refluxing renal units, respectively. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy revealed parenchymal abnormalities in 24 refluxing renal units (41%) in 22 patients (65%), of whom 19 (86%) were male and 15 (68%) had bilateral reflux. We noted differential uptake less than 40% with and without cortical defects in 10 and 7 refluxing units, respectively, and cortical defects only in 7. Of the 24 refluxing units with abnormalities 21 were associated with grade IV or V and 3 with grade II or III reflux. Ultrasound showed evidence of renal injury in only 7 of the 17 patients (41%) in whom 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy was abnormal. In our study the majority of infants with high grade reflux had decreased differential function and/or cortical defects. Parenchymal defects detected by 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy were often not identified by renal ultrasound. Therefore, 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is especially useful for initially evaluating infants with high grade, sterile vesicoureteral reflux."}

Patients were divided into two groups, those under 2 years old (n = 63) and those over 2 years old (n = 40). Cortical scintigraphy showed renal changes in 56 patients (54,5%). Children over 2 years of age had a higher incidence of renal lesions than younger children (39,7% vs. 77,5%). Ultrasonography measuring renal volume showed a simple concordance with scintigraphy in 64% of the patients. Reflux was demonstrated in 23 patients (22,3%) without differences between patients with normal or abnormal cortical scintigraphy. After having studied the factors that were associated independently to the pathological results in the scintigraphy through a logistical multivariant regression, it was observed that the child's age, the elevation of the PCR and the alterations of the renal volume were significant according to statistics and also associated to a larger amount of pathological DMSA scintigraphy. DMSA scintigraphy associated with other diagnostic methods can improve the sensitivity and specificity to establish renal damage stage. During the follow-up the acute lesions disappeared or improved in all cases and the chronic lesions have not been modificated."}

The degree of VUR was determined by conventional voiding cysto-uretherography (VCUG) after 3 months of prophylactic antibiotics. The VUR was grade I-IV, with grades III and IV characterized as high-grade VUR. In all patients, any urinary tract infections and bladder-urethral dysfunction were treated. Renal function and reflux were monitored by renal and bladder scintigraphy using 123I-hippuran and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined using the plasma clearance of 51Cr-ethylaminediamine tetra-acetic acid. Of the 60 patients who entered the study, 51 were followed for a mean of 13.7 years; nine patients were lost to follow-up. None of the patients underwent antireflux surgery. All patients were in good health and normotensive (except two with borderline hypertension). Of the 51 patients 21 had low-grade, 21 unilateral high-grade and nine bilateral high-grade reflux. In those with low-grade reflux both the mean renal split function on the most refluxing kidney and the GFR remained stable during the whole monitoring period. Eighteen patients who had a persistent reduction in renal split function or initially had had a significantly reduced functional share to the most refluxing kidney had their GFR re-assessed in adolescence. However, the body surface-corrected GFR remained constant. Total GFR and single kidney GFR increased significantly. A conservative treatment regimen in patients with VUR can ensure stable kidney function, although kidneys with a lower renal function at referral seem to have an impaired functional growth potential."}

Twelve patients with clinical and biological signs of urinary tract infection had no CT or (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy abnormalities. Among these patients, lower urinary tract infection was found in 10 patients and 2 patients had ureteral obstruction. In the 24 remaining patients, the diagnosis of APN was made. Among these patients, a correlation was found between CT and (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy in 11 cases. In two cases, both examinations were normal, and in nine cases, both were abnormal.

We examined the value of a second radionuclide cystogram in patients who were believed to be cured on 1 previous study and tried to identify variables that could explain the false-negative result on the initial cystogram. The study included 85 patients with primary vesicoureteral reflux, treated conservatively between 1991 and 1996 who had 1 negative radionuclide cystogram. A repeat radionuclide cystogram was done 12 to 18 months after the negative study. Patients were divided into those with and without reflux recurrence identified, and compared in regard to sex distribution, age at presentation and reflux resolution, time between presentation and first negative radionuclide cystogram, change in reflux grade between presentation and just before resolution, side of reflux at presentation and grade before resolution. The differences between both groups were statistically analyzed. Of the 85 patients 25 (29%) had reflux recurrence, including 18 (72%) with grade 2 or greater recurrent reflux and 15 (60%) with persistent reflux 12 months after the second positive radionuclide cystogram. There was no observed association between the 2 groups in any of the variables (p >0.05). This study emphasizes the importance of a second negative radionuclide cystogram to indicate the absence or resolution of reflux as 1 negative cystogram alone would have missed persistent reflux in 25 of 85 patients at 1 year and 15 of 85 patients at 2. Whether absence or resolution of reflux is a variable of the disease or an unknown factor inherent in the test is unknown as there was no statistical difference in the parameters studied between our 2 groups."}

Independent predictors for VUR were male gender, age, family history for uropathology, serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) and dilatation of the urinary tract on US. The ROC area of this model was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.87). This prediction model identified 12% (95% CI: 7-18) of the patients without VUR without missing one case of VUR. If we used VUR > or = grade 3 as a threshold, the model assessed VUR to be absent in 34% (95% CI: 26-42). A prediction rule based on age, gender, family history, CRP and US results is useful in assessing the probability of VUR in the individual child with a first UTI and may help the physician to make decisions about performing additional imaging techniques. Prospective validation of the model in future patients, however, will be necessary before applying the rule in practice."}

To assess the clinical characteristics of bacteremic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children. Clinical data of Finnish children with bacteremic UTI (n = 134) from 1985 to 1994 were analyzed. Their symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings were compared with those of age- and sex-matched patients hospitalized for blood culture negative UTI. Generally, no major differences were seen in clinical findings between bacteremic and nonbacteremic patients. Bacteremic children had more frequent feeding problems (P = 0.02), and children > or =12 months of age tended more often to have abdominal pain and vomiting than did nonbacteremic patients. Fever was the major initial symptom in both study groups, but no significant difference occurred in the mean highest temperature or in the mean of duration of fever before admission to the hospital. The mean concentration of serum C-reactive protein on admission was significantly higher in bacteremic patients (116 vs. 76 mg/l; P < 0.01). After onset of antimicrobial treatment fever lasted significantly longer in bacteremic patients than in control patients (means, 2.3 vs. 1.1 days; P < 0.01). Anatomic or functional abnormalities in the urinary tract were detected in 51% vs. 46%, respectively. Obstruction of the urinary tract (9% vs. 1%, P < 0.01) and Grade 3 to 5 vesicoureteral reflux (30% vs. 16%, P = 0.02) were significantly more frequent in bacteremic patients with UTI. Obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux was found in 46% of children with bacteremic UTI caused by Escherichia coli vs. 89% of children with non-E. coli infection (P < 0.01). Clinical symptoms do not significantly distinguish bacteremic from nonbacteremic children with UTI. Outcome of bacteremic UTI was comparable with that of nonbacteremic UTI. Bacteremic children, especially those with non-E. coli UTI, more often had anatomical or functional abnormalities in the urinary tract."}

Adolescent UTIs are markers for sexual activity, just as UTIs in younger children are often markers for anatomic defects, e.g., congenital abnormalities. Adolescents with upper and lower UTIs often have concurrent sexual activity or a complication of that activity. Issues among adolescents with UTIs are more similar to those of young adults than to those of younger children. It is as important to counsel adolescents about sexual activity and its consequences as it is to treat the UTIs. All adolescents with UTIs should be queried for sexual activity; evidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) should be sought; and counseling for STDs and responsible sexual activity is recommended. Complicated UTIs include those in patients who have grown into adolescence after a childhood of infections or who have anatomic abnormalities, recurrent infections, reflux and reflux nephropathy, spina bifida and neurogenic bladder, transplanted kidneys, diabetes, and urolithiasis. These patients require individualized medical programs, unique for their condition, history, and microbiology."}

Dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy was performed 4 to 6 and 1 to 4 months after reflux was diagnosed and/or the infection was cured in patients with urinary tract infection and prenatal detection, respectively. We identified 3 patterns of renal damage, including overall decreased uptake of renal radionuclide that was 20% to 40% of relative uptake, focal defects in uptake and shrunken kidney with relative uptake less than 20%. Scintigraphy revealed renal damage in 12 prenatally detected cases of vesicoureteral reflux, including overall decreased uptake in 58% and shrunken kidney in 42%, and in 111 cases of reflux detected at urinary tract infection, including overall decreased uptake in 50%, uptake focal defects in 37% and shrunken kidney in 13%. In the urinary tract infection group overall decreased uptake was present in 25 of 90 boys and in 40 of 232 girls (p = 0.05). Of these children 15% of the girls had uptake focal defects and 17% had overall decreased uptake. Overall decreased uptake and uptake focal defects were significantly more common in kidney-ureter units with reflux grade 4 or greater than in those with grade 3 or less (p = 0. 00001 and 0.027, respectively). When assuming that overall decreased radionuclide uptake indicates congenital reflux nephropathy and uptake focal defects indicate postnatal acquired scarring, congenital reflux nephropathy appears to be an important cause of renal damage in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux even beyond the neonatal age and even in girls. This finding is of interest because postnatally acquired scarring may but congenital reflux nephropathy may not be prevented."}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and to compare the test performance of the standard technique, planar DMSA, with the newly introduced technique, SPECT DMSA. All published animal studies in which DMSA scintigraphy was compared with histopathology, the reference standard for acute pyelonephritis, were identified using a comprehensive search strategy with the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Test performances of all DMSA methods and SPECT versus planar DMSA were analyzed using summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves. Seven studies were identified, including 2 of SPECT DMSA. Problems in study design or reporting were common, with numerical errors in 4 studies. Overall, at a sensitivity of 86%, specificity was estimated to be 91%. Detection of acute pyelonephritis was at a lower threshold for SPECT than for planar DMSA (sensitivity/specificity values of 97%0/66% compared with 82%/ 97%), and the overall test performance of SPECT was not demonstrably better than that of planar DMSA. When applied to a group of children with a prevalence of renal damage of 40%, this means that 98% of children with abnormal planar DMSA scans will have renal damage, whereas only 65% of those with abnormal SPECT scans will have renal damage. Planar and SPECT DMSA will miss 11% and 3% of children with renal damage, respectively. Out of 100 children in the hypothetical group with 40% experiencing renal damage, SPECT will identify 6 extra true cases of renal damage at the expense of 19 extra false positives, when compared with planar DMSA. Published studies of DMSA test performance are few in number and have significant methodologic problems that should be avoided in future studies. DMSA, particularly the planar technique, performs well for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Using test performance criteria, SPECT DMSA alone has not been shown to be preferable to the established planar method and will result in a small number of true-positives at the expense of a larger number of false-positives."}

Following acute partial and/or complete ureteral obstruction (UO) or chronic partial UO, alpha-1-microglobulin excretion is significantly higher than in the reference population or patients with proven renal dilatation without obstruction, but is not found to be diagnostic for these conditions as such. Chronic partial UO is followed first by a destructive and then by a steady-state phase in renal damage. The observed increase in tubular proteinuria during the destructive phase correlates with the decrease in absolute dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake. If the destructive phase is not followed by a stable phase, a mixed tubular and glomerular proteinuria is seen. Urinary alpha-1-microglobulin excretion is found to be diagnostically useful in vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) patients, increases with higher intravesical-intrapyelic pressure, correlates with the decrease in absolute DMSA uptake or with urinary epidermal growth factor excretion (both markers of the number of functioning nephrons) and predicts the outcome after treatment. alpha-1-Microglobulin is useful in the detection of renal tubular damage in patients with outflow disease of the upper tract, is diagnostic for VUR but is not so for ureteral obstruction."}

Nineteen had vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), 1 had VUR and a double collecting system, 1 had VUR and a posterior urethral valve, and 1 had an ureteropelvic junction stricture. Renal atrophy or scars, as demonstrated by DMSA scan, were detected almost exclusively in neonates with VUR grade 3 and above. Only 1 neonate with VUR grade 1 had a pathologic DMSA, and the US of this male also demonstrated renal atrophy. Escherichia coli was the pathogen in 62% (28 of 45), and 9 boys had bacteremia.

The early detection of urologic abnormalities by antenatal sonography has resulted in the investigation of many infants and neonates for suspicion of either obstructive uropathy or reflux nephropathy. Nuclear medicine techniques allow to assess renal parenchyma integrity, to detect pyelonephritic scars and to measure absolute and relative renal function; these methods are easy to perform and reproducible, without any sedation, repeated venous punctures or bladder catheterization. Furthermore, the use of dynamic tubular tracers and frusemide test is a very usefull method which can differentiate between upper and/or lower urinary tract obstruction and determine the degree of obstruction (severe or incomplete) in order to plan for surgery or conservative treatment. The detection of vesicoureteric reflux may be difficult as it is an intermittent phenomenon: the use of the indirect radionuclide cystography (IRC), that is to say after completion of a dynamic renography, allows to detect reflux with a high sensitivity because images can be recorded continuously until the child voids, without any bladder catheterization and at low radiation dosis. In case of discordant results between micturating cysto-urethrography and IRC or of concomittant obstructive uropathy, the direct radionuclide cystography (DRC) is indicated for appropriate treatment. Nuclear medicine techniques do not give morphological information about the urinary tract and should be considered as complementary to radiological investigations in first evaluation of children with recurrent urinary tract infections or hydronephrosis."}

Voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and ultrasonography (US) were performed within 6 weeks following the infection. DMSA was performed at least 4 months after the urinary tract infection (UTI). The renal parenchymal pathology was defined as focal or multifocal defects or as a split renal uptake of less than 45%. DMSA scintigraphy revealed that 19% (14/74) of the children had renal damage. Renal parenchymal findings were observed only when VUR was present, and its grade was above 3/5. No abnormality was found in 51 renal units without reflux, 9 with VUR grade 1/5, and 54 with grade 2/5. Renal pathology was observed in 9/24 renal units with VUR grade 3, 3/8 with grade 4, and 2/2 with grade 5. No correlation was found between renal parenchymal defects and clinical presentation of the pyelonephritis, type of the microorganism, presence of bacteremia, or the number of recurrent infections. In adequately treated infants, renal damage is probably due to a reflux-associated, preexisting, congenital renal parenchymal pathology and not to the inflammatory process. We suggest that DMSA scintigraphy should not be performed routinely in every infant with UTI and should be reserved primarily for children with VUR grade 3 and above."}

Plasma and urinary E-a(1)-Pi, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), neutrophil count, urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase b (NAG b), and creatinine levels were measured in all patients on admission and 3 days after the introduction of antibiotics. The same markers were also measured in the control subjects. Planar DMSA scintigraphy demonstrated changes of acute pyelonephritis in 30 of 83 children (group A). It was normal in the remaining 53 children (group B). The sex and age distributions were not significantly different between the 2 groups, as well as between the patients and the control subjects (group C). Nineteen of the 53 children with a normal DMSA had body temperature >/=38 degrees C, whereas all but 4 children with abnormal DMSA had temperature >/=38 degrees C. Therefore, the temperature was significantly different between these 2 groups. The sensitivity and specificity of fever (>/=38 degrees C) as an indicator of renal involvement based on isotopic findings were 86% and 64%, respectively. Given the significant number of the febrile children with normal DMSA scintiscans, group B was subdivided into B(1) with 19 febrile children (14 boys and 5 girls) and B(2) with 34 children whose body temperature was below 38 degrees C (8 boys and 26 girls). The sex and age distribution was significantly different between groups B(1) and B(2). The mean age of group B(1) was.78 years (range: 28 days to 9 years; median:.25 years; standard deviation: 2.1). All but 1 child in this group were younger than 1 year of age. In contrast, in group B(2), there were only 4 infants, the remaining 30 children were older than 2.5 years (mean age: 6 years; median: 7 years; standard deviation: 3.5; range: 34 days to 12 years). The mean duration of fever before hospital admission was 2.8 days for group A and 1.8 days for group B(1). This difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, body temperature was not significantly different between these 2 groups. The distribution of plasma E-a(1)-Pi values was normal in the control subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma E-a(1)-Pi, as an indicator of renal involvement, were 96% and 50%, respectively, taking the 95th percentile of the reference range as a cutoff value. However, considering as a cutoff value the level of 72 microg/dL (95th percentile of group B(2)), its sensitivity and specificity were 74% and 86%, respectively. Plasma E-a(1)-Pi levels were significantly elevated in group A compared with group B and in both groups, the plasma E-a(1)-Pi values were significantly higher than in the control subjects. A significant difference also was noticed between group A and each of the subgroups B(1) and B(2) and also between the subgroups themselves. Plasma E-a(1)-Pi concentrations correlated significantly with neutrophil count in groups A (r =.3), B (r =.4), and B(2) (r =.46), but the correlation was not significant in group B(1.) ESR levels showed, among the different groups, similar differences with those of E-a(1)-Pi values. Unlike E-a(1)-Pi, CRP levels were comparable between groups A and B(1), which both consisted of febrile children. Neutrophil count was not significantly different between subgroups B(1) and B(2).

To assess the usefulness of laboratory parameters, including peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and microscopic urinalysis (UA), for identifying febrile infants younger than 8 weeks of age at risk for urinary tract infection (UTI), and comparison of standard UA and hemocytometer WBC counts for predicting the presence of UTI. A total of 162 febrile children <8 weeks of age were enrolled in this prospective study. All underwent clinical evaluation and laboratory investigation, including WBC count and differential; ESR; CRP; blood culture; a lumbar puncture for cell count and differential, glucose level, protein level, Gram stain, and culture; and a UA and urine culture. All urine specimens were obtained by suprapubic aspiration and microscopically analyzed with standard UA as well as with hemocytometer WBC counts. Quantitative urine cultures were performed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, likelihood ratios, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were determined for each of the screening tests. There were 22 positive urine culture results of at least 100 colony-forming unit/mL. Eighteen of these 22 patients were males, and all were uncircumcised. There were significant differences for pyuria >/=5 WBCs/hpf, pyuria >/=10 WBC/microL, CRP >20 mg/L, and ESR >30 mm/hour between culture-positive and culture-negative groups (P <.05). The ROC area for hemocytometer WBC count, standard UA, peripheral WBC count, ESR, and CRP concentration were.909 +/-.045,.791 +/-.065,.544 +/-.074,. 787 +/-.060, and.822 +/-.036, respectively. The ROC curve analysis indicates that the CRP, ESR, and standard UA were powerful but imperfect tools with which to discriminate for UTI in potentially infected neonates. Hemocytometer WBC counts had the highest sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and likelihood ratios for identifying very young infants with positive urine culture results. For all assessments, hemocytometer WBC counts were significantly different, compared with the standard urinalysis. ESR, CRP, and peripheral WBC counts were not helpful in identifying UTI in febrile infants. UTI had a prevalence of 13.6% in febrile infants <8 weeks of age. The CRP, ESR, and standard UA were imperfect tools in discriminating for UTI, and the sensitivity of these laboratory parameters was relatively low. Hemocytometer WBC count was a significantly better predictor of UTI in febrile infants."}

Ninety-seven children who were followed up for more than one year (1-7.4 years, average 2.8 years) after the first DMSA scan were included in the study. Fifty-one patients had been diagnosed as primary VUR and 46 as secondary VUR. Age at the first examination ranged from 0 to 14 years (average 5.1 years). Planar images were taken 2 hours after injection. The % renal uptake per injected dose (%RU) was calculated from posterior images. Kidneys in 11 patients (11.3%) changed morphologically during the follow up. Of these, new photon deficient areas (PD) were detected in only 4 patients (4.1%). All of these 4 patients had neurogenic bladder and were managed with self-catheterization. Of the remaining 7 patients, cortical thinning progressed in 5 patients (5.2%) and PDs resolved in 3 patients (3.1%). In one of these 7 patients, PD resolved in one kidney and cortical thinning progressed in the contralateral kidney. Of 97 patients reviewed, % RU decreased more than 20% during the follow up in 6 patients (6.2%). All were diagnosed as secondary VUR due to neurogenic bladder. %RU decreased only in the contracted kidneys at the initial scan. Two of them underwent renal transplantation because of severe renal failure. In conclusion, new PD rarely developed and % RU decreased in only a few patients during the follow up of children with VUR. Repeated Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy therefore seems to have little benefit in the follow up of children with VUR. It should be performed in selected patients with high risk of urinary tract infection or renal failure."}

Two hundred and eighty-five children under 15 years old (169 boys and 116 girls) who had urinary tract infection (UTI) were admitted to our hospital during the period July 1995 to June 1998. Clinical presentation, laboratory data and image studies were recognized and analyzed. Most patients were younger than 2 years of age. Fever is the most common sign, especially in young children. With the urinary dipstick test a low positive rate of nitrite reaction (34.7%) was found. E. coli is the most common pathogen and exclusively resistant to ampicillin (90.2%). The E. coli is also relatively resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (57.1%). Voiding cystourethrogram was performed in 187 cases, in which 24.6% of those patients showed vesicoureteric reflux. Ninety-eight children received 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans and 62 cases (63.3%) had abnormal findings compatible with pyelonephritis. The positive predictive values by renal ultrasonography for vesicoureteric reflux and pyelonephritis are 30.7% and 78.9%, respectively. In pyelonephritis patients, only 37% also had a vesicoureteric reflux. The fever duration and clinical inflammatory parameters were evaluated in all patients. Longer febrile periods are the risk of vesicoureteric reflux and pyelonephritis, and a high C-reactive protein concentration indicates the risk of pyelonephritis. In conclusion, fever was the most common sign in young UTI children who had a low positive nitrite reaction rate in the dipstick test. E. coli was the most common pathogen with a high ampicillin resistance in Taiwan. Only 37% pyelonephritis patients had refluxing nephropathy. It is indicated that pyelonephritis is not always attributed to reflux of infected urine. A longer febrile period and a high C-reactive protein level are good indicators for prediction of the risk of pyelonephritis in UTI patients."}

Improved methods of quantifying CRP have led to increased application to clinical medicine. In the emergency department (ED), CRP must be interpreted in the clinical context; no single value can be used to rule in or rule out a specific diagnosis. We conclude that CRP has limited utility in the ED. It may be a useful adjunct to serial examinations in equivocal presentations of appendicitis in those centers without ready access to computed tomography (CT) scan. It may be elevated with complications or treatment failures in patients with pneumonia, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and urinary tract infections. In patients with meningitis, neonatal sepsis, and occult bacteremia, CRP is usually elevated. However, CRP has no role in diagnosing these clinical entities, and a normal CRP level should never delay antibiotic coverage."}

The average age of the patients was 4.4 years, and the female:male ratio was 7:1. Static images of the kidneys were acquired 2 hours after injection of Tc-99m DMSA in anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique views. SPECT was performed in 9% of the cases. The studies were scored as normal or abnormal. The yield of abnormal scans in first-time UTIs was 22 (42%) and in recurrent UTI 27 (55%). Three categories of abnormalities were noted: 1) renal cortical defects (55% of the abnormal scans in first-time UTIs and 59% of the abnormal scans in recurrent UTIs; P = 0.40); 2) dilated pelvicalyceal system (27% of the abnormal studies in first-time UTIs and 63% of the abnormal studies in recurrent UTIs; P < 0.01); and 3) renal swelling showing disproportionate function with size (41% of the abnormal scans in first-time UTIs and 22% of the abnormal scans in recurrent UTIs; P = 0.21). The high yield of renal abnormalities by Tc-99m DMSA scanning emphasizes the importance of testing all cases of UTI, including patients with a first-time infection.

This article reviews the literature with respect to various risk factors for permanent renal damage in children with urinary tract infection. Vesico-ureteric reflux is an important risk factor, but renal damage can occur in the absence of reflux. Renal damage does not always occur in the presence of gross reflux. Renal scars always develop at the same site as a previous infection in the kidney. Recurrent pyelonephritis and delay in therapy increase the likelihood of renal damage, although it is not known how long a delay is dangerous to the human kidney. Recent studies using 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy have not confirmed the findings of previous studies showing that children below 1 y of age are more vulnerable to renal damage. It is more likely that all children run the risk of renal scarring in cases of acute pyelonephritis. The role of bladder pressure is still not entirely understood. Therefore more studies are needed in order to determine the relationship between high voiding pressures in some, otherwise healthy, children with urinary tract infection and renal scarring. The importance of bacterial virulence in the development of renal scarring is unclear. DMSA scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography are the most reliable tools for identifying children at risk of renal scarring. As a single method DMSA scintigraphy appears to be better than voiding cystourethrography."}

With DMSA scintigraphy, small renal lesions (functional uptake defects) not seen at urography will also be detected. The long-term clinical significance of these lesions is, as yet, unknown. A normal DMSA scintigraphy after infection indicates low risk for clinically significant damage. In order to allow acute, reversible lesions to first disappear, a follow-up DMSA examination should not be performed until at least 6 mo after the acute infection. Ultrasonography in isolation cannot be recommended for the diagnosis of renal scarring."}

A variety of factors can influence the occurrence of reflux, e.g. race, genetics, state of maturation of the ureterovesical valve, diuresis, infection and bladder dysfunction, including obstruction and neurogenic disorders. Even when reflux is investigated under strictly standardized conditions, two consecutive bladder fillings frequently show different grades of reflux. Voiding cystourethrography is, to date, the only method with a generally accepted, well-defined grading of reflux. It also allows detection of intrarenal reflux and anatomical and functional information about the bladder and urethra that is unobtainable by other methods. It is therefore usually considered the method of choice. Radionuclide cystography and, possibly, contrast enhanced ultrasonography can be complementary to voiding cystourethrography, but mainly for postoperative follow-up and screening of siblings."}

A group of 290 children under 5 years of age with a first symptomatic UTI were studied. Micturating cystourethrogram and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy were performed at entry, and DMSA was repeated 1 year later. Two hundred and sixty-one children (90%) were followed up at 1 year. There were 46 confirmed recurrent infections in 34 children, a recurrence rate of 12%. Multiple recurrence occurred in 14/34 (34%) children. Age of less than 6 months on entry independently predicted for recurrent UTI (odds ratio (OR): 2.9)). Compliance with prophylactic antibiotics fell throughout the year of follow up. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was present in 14/34 (34%) of the group with recurrent UTI, 69/256 (27%) without recurrence. Urinary tract infection was significantly associated with bilateral and intrarenal reflux; grade 3-5 reflux independently predicted for recurrent UTI (OR: 3.5). Recurrent UTI was significantly associated with high grade DMSA defects on entry, renal parenchymal defects at 1 year follow up, and new defects at 1 year. The independent risk factors for recurrent UTI identified by this study were an age of less than 6 months at the index UTI and grade 3-5 VUR.

The authors present the results of a survey conducted among French paediatric urologists belonging to the Groupe d'Etudes en Urologie P\u00e9diatrique (GEUP) (Paediatric Urology Study Group). This study, based on 122 cases observed in 13 centres, is not exhaustive, but is nevertheless statistically significant. The preoperative assessment confirms the usual findings of urinary stones in children: pyelonephritis, haematuria and abdominal pain, the usual presenting complaint, concomitant malformative uropathy (10% of cases) and a predominance of calcium stones. More than 200 stones were treated, larger than 10 millimeters in diameter in one-third of cases. Renal stones, mainly caliceal (more than 50%), included 11 staghorn calculi. This study also included 22 ureteric stones, mainly in the pelvic ureter, and 2 bladder stones. Lithotripsy was ultrasound-guided in 2/3 of cases and required general anaesthesia in about 3/4 of cases. Ureteric catheterization was required in 19 infants preoperatively, but in only 2 infants (stein strasse) postoperatively. One or two lithotripsy sessions were sufficient in most cases, but 4 sessions were necessary in 5 patients, to the same kidney in 1 case. The mean hospital stay was 2 to 3 days, but the procedure was performed on an outpatient basis in 15 cases. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful and asymptomatic. This survey revealed about 10% of complete failures, corresponding to solitary caliceal stones in 2/3 of cases; 29 partial failures were essentially due to lower caliceal stones and staghorn calculi; 84 successes (stone-free), mainly pelvic or simple caliceal stones. Scintigraphy did not reveal any immediate postoperative impairment of renal function. This study reported a success rate of about 70%, regardless of the type of apparatus used. Assessment of the results of ESWL requires sufficient follow-up both concerning the outcome of fragmented stones and evaluation of possible functional repercussions. This survey defines the main indications: although ESWL can be applied to most stones, some stones constitute poor indications (cystine stones, stenotic malformative uropathy) or dubious indications: small lower caliceal stones, densely calcified staghorn calculi in older children. This study confirmed the efficacy and low morbidity of ESWL in children. A prospective study needs to be conducted according to a rigorous protocol in order to refine the technique and indications while reducing the possible long-term risks."}

VUR was present during cycle 1 in 40 (32%) of 124 patients with severe urinary tract infection and 90 (67%) of 135 children in the VUR follow-up group (P < .001). VUR was demonstrated during cycle 2 in seven (9%) of 76 of the severe urinary tract infection group and eight (24%) of 34 of the VUR follow-up group (P = .045). Of 15 patients with VUR during cycle 2, two had grade III VUR and 13 had grade I or II VUR. The second cycle of cyclic cystography has a higher diagnostic yield in patients undergoing VUR follow-up than in patients with severe urinary tract infection. The decision to perform a second cycle of bladder filling and voiding should take into account the pretest probability of VUR in the child being examined."}

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in pregnancy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical presentation, management and outcome in patients who underwent appendectomy during pregnancy. The case records of 56 women who underwent appendectomy during pregnancy between January 1985 and December 1997 were reviewed and analyzed. The incidence of appendicitis in pregnancy was one in 766 births. The preoperative diagnosis was correct in 75% of the cases. Uterine contractions and a history of diffuse or periumbilical pain migrating to the right lower abdominal quadrant were significantly more frequent among women with appendicitis compared to those patients where the appendectomy revealed a normal appendices. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, leukocyte count, CRP and body temperature were not helpful in establishing the correct diagnosis. There was no maternal morbidity related to the appendectomy. Pregnancy complications were found to be considerable: 4/12 (33%) who underwent appendectomy for appendicitis during the first trimester aborted spontaneously. Second trimester appendectomy for appendicitis was followed by premature delivery in 4/28 (14%). However, no pregnancy complications were observed following third trimester appendectomy for appendicitis. We found no increase in pregnancy complications in cases with perforated appendicitis. Appendicitis in pregnancy should be suspected when a pregnant woman complains of new abdominal pain. No laboratory finding was found to be diagnostic for acute appendicitis during pregnancy. Considerable fetal loss was found after appendectomy during pregnancy in the first and second trimester. No increase in pregnancy complications in cases with perforated appendicitis was observed. The combination of symptoms and clinical judgement is still vital in deciding which patient needs surgical treatment. Based on the results in the present study we recommend prophylactic antibiotic treatment in all laparotomies during pregnancy when appendicitis is suspected."}

The subjects comprised 11 children, six boys and five girls, aged 3 months through to 3 years (median age 16 months), whose initial CRP levels were < 1.0 mg/dL despite bacterial infection. C-reactive protein was quantitated at the first medical examination by nephelometry. The diagnosis was urinary tract infection (n = 4), bacterial meningitis (n = 2), sepsis (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2) and arthritis of the hip joint (n = 1). The CRP levels were significantly elevated during the course of infection, ranging from 7.6 to 28.5 mg/dL. The bacterial etiology was non-specific. Eight patients were examined within 12 h of onset, three exhibited negative CRP values despite the duration of the insult over 12 h. Six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection, but the other five were not. Each patient was treated, leading to a favorable outcome without any serious complications. Low levels of CRP do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. The initial value of CRP may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. The data suggest that pediatricians should consistently be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial CRP test result is negative and that serial CRP measurements appear to be practical."}

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was cultured from the blood, and vancomycin was started on the 5th hospital day. Because of the persistent fever and signs of inflammation, Gallium-scintigraphy was performed, showing abnormal accumulation in the left fronto-parietal region of the brain and the sacral region. Enhanced brain CT revealed a crescentic low density area and a fine, intense line of enhancement in the left fronto-parietal region. An emergency drainage of abscess was performed via single left fronto-parietal burr hole. A slightly yellowish, bloody, purulent fluid was obtained. The subdural space was irrigated with saline containing antibiotics and a drain was inserted. MRSA was cultured from the obtained fluid. The fever gradually subsided and drowsiness disappeared. He had had decubitus ulcer, stage I on the surface, in the sacral region, which later turned out to have unexpectedly deep undermining lesion reaching to periosteum. MRSA was cultured from this decubitus lesion. MRSA which entered into blood stream from the decubitus site might have been implanted in the subdural hematoma.

This study evaluated the utility of Ga-67 renal SPECT for diagnosing acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children and monitoring them. Seventy-one children (ages 1 week to 12 years) who were thought clinically to have APN were included in the study. The disease was considered present if the patients had all of the following: fever (38.5 degrees C), pyuria (leukocyte counts/per high-power field > or = 10), and a positive result of a urinary culture or blood culture. Tc-99m DMSA, Ga-67 renal SPECT, and voiding cystourethrography were performed, with informed consent from the patients' parents, within 3 days after hospitalization. Three months after treatment, Tc-99m DMSA and Ga-67 renal SPECT were repeated in those patients who had abnormal results of the initial Ga-67 renal SPECT. In the diagnostic study, Ga-67 renal SPECT was superior to DMSA renal SPECT in detecting lesions (97% vs. 79%). Three children had false-negative results with Ga-67 renal SPECT. Seventeen kidneys were negative with Tc-99m DMSA but positive with Ga-67 renal SPECT. No patients had any Ga-67 uptake on post-therapy imaging. However, 32 of 107 kidneys (30%) had permanent renal scars. In these 107 kidneys, 78 (73%) were associated with high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR; VUR grade > or = 3) and 29 (27%) with low-grade or no VUR. High-grade VUR tends to be associated more with APN than has been reported by others, probably because of an underestimation of APN by ultrasonography or DMSA. Ga-67 renal SPECT is sensitive and useful not only in diagnosis but also for monitoring and follow-up of children with clinical suspicion of APN, especially in those with equivocal results after DMSA renal SPECT studies."}

The evolution of clinical presentation, age of surgery and therapeutic approach of obstructive nonrefluxing megaureters (OMU) in children throughout the years has been retrospectively evaluated. 78 children with 92 stenotic ureterovesical junctions (UVJ) were reviewed. 66 underwent surgery at a median age of 20 months, after a median of 10.5 months of conservative treatment with prophylactic antibiotics. 21 OMU were diagnosed prenatally, 71 because of symptoms at later age. 15 ureters (12 children) (24% in the prenatal, 14% in the second group) were treated in a conservative way for 2 years with antibiotics. In the prenatal group 33% needed a reimplantation with tailoring and 10% without tailoring while in the other group the figures are reversed: 39% without and 21% with tailoring. 28% in the prenatal group and 17% of the second group were reimplanted at a mean of 15 months after a primary cutaneous ureterostomy. Three of 5 ureteroceles were treated by endoscopic incision; 4 had an immediate nephroureterectomy. The mean follow-up is >70 months. By prenatal diagnosis the number of conservatively treated cases increased from 14 to 24%. Indications for surgery remained unchanged: recurrent infection and poor kidney function. Both approaches resulted in stabilization of pretreatment renal function; nearly half of the DMSA scans showed a R:L difference of >20% at follow-up. Ureterostomy for infected deteriorating kidneys rapidly ameliorated the function and resulted in shrinking of the ureteral diameter making tailoring at reimplantation unnecessary. One of the 3 endoscopically incised ureteroceles required later reintervention. Male:female (3:1), left:right (2:1) prevalence and high associated urological (30%) and nonurological (19%) pathology is found. Unsatisfactory reliability of tests for obstruction diagnosis and a referral bias explains the larger number of conservatively treated ureters in the prenatal group. Despite prenatal diagnosis, the age for surgery was not altered since the indications remained identical. Most OMU can be treated by a simple or tailored reimplantation of the ureter after resection of the stenotic segment. A temporary ureterostomy in small children with refractory infections restores function and avoids the necessity for tailoring at final reconstruction. One of 3 endoscopically incised ureteroceles needed surgery at a later stage. DMSA shows stable function after reimplantation."}

We evaluated renal scarring after surgery using a more accurate method, that is dimercapto-succinic acid renal scintigraphy. Between 1985 and 1997 antireflux surgery was performed for primary vesicoureteral reflux in 223 children at our hospital. Of these patients 45 boys and 29 girls with a median age of 74 months at surgery in whom preoperative and postoperative renal scans were available form the basis of our retrospective study. Renal scan was performed 0.3 to 58 months (median 2) preoperatively and 5.3 to 44 months (median 18.7) postoperatively. A total of 24 children (39 renal units) were followed further by additional scanning for as long as 25 to 120 months (median 43.2) postoperatively. Each scan was blindly reviewed for the size, number and zone location of cortical defects based on morphology. Interval changes were grouped into categories as improved, no change, progressed and new scar formation. Postoperatively there was no ureteral obstruction. Pyelonephritis developed in 2 patients (2.7%) and asymptomatic bacteriuria was noted in 35 (47.3%) postoperatively. Of the renal units 110 (86.6%) showed no change, while 15 (11.8%) were improved and 2 (1.6%) had progression. In no case was new renal scar formation observed. Contrary to most previous reports involving excretory urography, our results indicate no significant progression of renal scarring after antireflux surgery. In most cases postoperative followup renal scans demonstrated no significant morphological change. When there was change, it mostly involved the disappearance or decrease of renal scars."}

We investigate the efficacy of antibiotics combined with corticosteroid in diminishing post-pyelonephritic renal scarring compared to standard antibiotic therapy. Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux was surgically created in 36 piglets (72 kidneys). A week later each bladder was inoculated by percutaneous injection with a standardized broth culture of Escherichia coli and molten paraffin. 99mTechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed 3 days after introduction of urinary infection to detect the presence of acute pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritic lesions seen on DMSA scans were graded according to the percentage of renal zone involvement as grade 1--less than 33%, grade 2--33 to 66% and grade 3--greater than 66% involved. When pyelonephritis was present, piglets were randomized to receive either standard antibiotics or antibiotics and 2 mg./kg. prednisolone daily. 99mTechnetium-DMSA scintigraphy was repeated 2 months after completion of therapy, and the kidneys were harvested for gross and histopathological examination. Each kidney was divided into upper, middle and lower zones for correlation of pathological and imaging findings. Severity of renal scarring was then assessed using histopathological confirmation of gross anatomical findings as grade 1--less than 1, grade 2-1 to 2 and grade 3-greater than 2 cm. Acute pyelonephritis was induced in 136 of 216 renal zones. The sites of renal scarring corresponded anatomically to sites of acute pyelonephritis in all but 5 cases. Overall, the prevalence of post-pyelonephritic scarring was 56.6% (77 of 136) of renal zones. The severity of scarring in both groups correlated with the severity of the initial pyelonephritic lesion. Of the 31 zones that formed grade 3 renal scars the distribution of grades 1, 2 and 3 acute pyelonephritis on the initial DMSA scan was 3, 26 and 71%, respectively. Grade 3 acute pyelonephritis was more likely to result in severe (grade 3) renal scars in the control compared to the steroid treated group (59 versus 31%). Overall, acute pyelonephritis completely resolved in 40% of controls and 51% of steroid treated animals. However, only 9% of control animals with grade 3 acute pyelonephritis demonstrated complete resolution, as opposed to 28% of those receiving steroids. The risk of renal scarring is greatest after severe acute pyelonephritis involving greater than 66% of a renal zone. Adjunctive oral prednisolone appears to be effective in diminishing renal scarring in severely affected kidneys. In kidneys with mild and moderate acute pyelonephritis antibiotics alone appear to be equally effective in preventing scarring."}

To avoid the exposure to unnecessary and injurious x-rays, the authors propose patient selection based on the presence or absence of distal ureteral dilatation and on the time elapsed between typical or atypical symptoms of u.t.i. and fever. First of all, it is essential to diagnose pielonephritis. After ultrasound and radionuclide scintigram with DMSA they select the infants who need cystourethrography.

In clinically severe cases, however, which fail to respond to antibiotic therapy, ultrasound is the optimal procedure for ruling out urinary tract obstruction. Where there is clinical suspicion of complications proven risk factors, persistent fever and/or continuing pathological inflammation parameters (elevated C-reactive protein levels in serum)-ultrasonography is the primary imaging technique for the exclusion of pyonephrosis, as well as for other complicating factors such as calculi, etc. In cases of insufficient response to antibiotic therapy, we recommend performing a renal computed tomography scan with contrast medium, in order to rule out hypoenhancing zones as hints for severe tissue alterations. This procedure is in accordance with the suggestions of the Society for Uroradiology. In the future, DMSA scintigraphy might constitute an equivalent diagnostic method for the exclusion of these focal inflammatory changes.

The availability of potent, oral, third-generation cephalosporins as well as interest in cost containment and avoidance of nosocomial risks prompted evaluation of the safety and efficacy of outpatient therapy. In a multicenter, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy of oral versus initial intravenous therapy in 306 children 1 to 24 months old with fever and urinary tract infection, in terms of short-term clinical outcomes (sterilization of the urine and defervescence) and long-term morbidity (incidence of reinfection and incidence and extent of renal scarring documented at 6 months by 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans). Children received either oral cefixime for 14 days (double dose on day 1) or initial intravenous cefotaxime for 3 days followed by oral cefixime for 11 days. Treatment groups were comparable regarding demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics. Bacteremia was present in 3.4% of children treated orally and 5.3% of children treated intravenously. Of the short-term outcomes, 1) repeat urine cultures were sterile within 24 hours in all children, and 2) mean time to defervescence was 25 and 24 hours for children treated orally and intravenously, respectively. Of the long-term outcomes, 1) symptomatic reinfections occurred in 4.6% of children treated orally and 7.2% of children treated intravenously, 2) renal scarring at 6 months was noted in 9.8% children treated orally versus 7.2% of children treated intravenously, and 3) mean extent of scarring was approximately 8% in both treatment groups.

Scientific Committee of Radionuclides in Nephrourology. A questionnaire related to cortical scintigraphy in children with urinary tract infection was submitted to 30 experts.

The general opinion is that DMSA scintigraphy is not feasible with a minimal dose below 15 MBq, whereas the maximum dose should not be higher than 110 MBq. The dose schedule generally is based on body surface area, and sedation is only exceptionally given to children. Images are obtained 2 to 3 hours after injection, preferably with high resolution collimators; pinhole images are used by only half of the experts. Posterior and posterior oblique views are used by most of the experts, and the posterior view is acquired in supine positions. At least 200.000 kcounts or 5 minute acquisition is required for nonzoomed images. As a quality control, experts check the presence of blurred or double outlines on the DMSA images. Color images are not used and experts report on film or directly on the computer screen. As far as normal DMSA images are concerned, most experts agree on several normal variants. Hydronephrosis is not a contraindication for DMSA scintigraphy but constitutes a pitfall. Differential renal function generally is measured, but no consensus is reached whether or not background should be subtracted. Most of the experts consider 45% as the lowest normal value. A consensus is reached on some scintigraphic aspects that are likely to improve and on some others that probably represent persistent sequelae. There is a wide consensus for the systematic use of DMSA scintigraphy for detection of renal sequelae, whereas only 58% of the experts are systematically performing this examination during the acute phase of infection."}

In patients with unilateral lesions, both the overall GFR and the SKGFR were significantly higher during the acute phase of infection than several months later, on the abnormal side as well as the normal side. The relative percentage uptake was lower on the abnormal side than the normal side, obviously due to loss of functional parenchyma. This percentage increased significantly during the recovery phase, reflecting the total or partial healing of the renal lesions, despite the decrease of the corresponding SKGFR. However, during both the acute and the recovery phase, the relative percentage uptake of the abnormal kidney was in the normal range and often close to 50%.

We proposed to determine the utility of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scanning in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). During a 24-month period, we evaluated the charts of 368 patients who had undergone SPECT DMSA renal scanning for primary VUR. Patients were divided into three age groups: (a) less than 1 year, (b) between 1 and 5 years, and (c) older than 6 years. Renal scars were deemed severe or focal. The data were analyzed to evaluate the utility of SPECT DMSA scanning in children with primary VUR and to determine the indications for performing SPECT DMSA. We also evaluated the sensitivity of recent renal ultrasound technology in detecting focal and diffuse scars. One hundred twenty-eight patients were younger than 1 year at presentation. These included 24 cases that were detected prenatally. One hundred eighty-five were between the ages of 1 and 5 years, and 55 were 6 years or older. Reflux nephropathy at presentation was found in 99 (26.9%) of 368 patients. DMSA scanning changed the treatment in only 13 patients (3.5%). When scarring was diffuse, ultrasound examination correlated 100% with DMSA scanning; when focal scarring was present, the correlation was poor. Our results suggest that DMSA scans should be tailored to children who have ultrasound abnormalities, high-grade reflux, or recurrent breakthrough urinary tract infections. These guidelines will result in a substantial cost savings and a significant decrease in radiation exposure."}

Quantitative 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal uptake was studied in unilateral reflux-related pyelonephritis in pigs. The changes to absolute % dose uptake and differential uptake occurring with induction and after treatment of pyelonephritis were correlated with the DMSA images and renal pathology. Quantitative uptake in 53 young pigs was obtained from planar images acquired 6 h after injecting the dose. Baseline studies were made (Q1), and studies were made again after urinary infection was established (Q2), when 8 pigs had normal (no defect) renal images (group A), 23 had photon-deficient (reversible) focal defects (group B) and 22 had photon absent (irreversible) focal defects (group C). Q3 studies were made in 21 animals from groups B and C after 3-wk antimicrobial treatment. At Q2 the affected kidney differential uptake was unchanged for group A and reduced for groups B and C (respective mean changes -1.7%, P < 0.01; and -5.5%, P < 0.01). The absolute % dose uptake was unchanged in pyelonephritic kidneys, but increased in the contralateral nondiseased kidneys in groups B and C (respective mean increases +1.4%, P < 0.05; and +5.4%, P < 0.01), while remaining unchanged for group A. In group C, global renal accumulation was actually increased above the Q1 values. After treatment (Q3) the reduced pyelonephritic kidney differential uptake persisted in groups B and C. In group C, however, the increased absolute % dose uptake by the contralateral kidney was less marked and not significantly different from Q1 values in this small group. Induction of unilateral pyelonephritis produced a small reduction in diseased kidney differential uptake that was greatest in the group with irreversible imaging defects. The method did not discriminate individuals with reversible and irreversible imaging defects. The decrease in pyelonephritic kidney differential uptake resulted from increased DMSA accumulation (absolute % dose uptake) by the nondiseased contralateral kidney, while that in pyelonephritic kidneys remained unchanged. After treatment, the reduced pyelonephritic kidney differential uptake persisted, but the elevated global DMSA accumulation seen for group C (with irreversible imaging defects) was not sustained and was variable."}

Thickening of the renal pelvis and renal enlargement were the most frequent associated sonographic abnormalities. Further subtle findings can be found on sonography and colour/power Doppler. Their identification can help in the diagnostic approach to acute pyelonephritis and may obviate the need for other imaging modalities such as enhanced CT or 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. Renal sinus hyperechogenicity was also identified in a parallel study performed in female rabbits with experimental pyelonephritis and was shown, histologically, to be related to exudates of fibrin and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, interstitial oedema and micro-abscesses."}

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is assumed to be congenital, and its early diagnosis is desired in order to prevent acquired renal damage. However, the incidence of VUR in neonates remains to be revealed. Two thousand newborn babies (1048 boys and 952 girls) underwent voiding ultrasonography (an ultrasound examination of urinary tract during provoked voiding). Those who showed transient renal pelvic dilation during voiding, who had small kidneys, or who subsequently developed urinary infection underwent voiding cystourethrography. Transient renal pelvic dilation was observed in 16 babies (0.8%), including one boy with small kidneys. Among the rest of the babies, one boy had a small kidney, and nine babies subsequently developed urinary infection. Voiding cystourethrography revealed VUR in 24 ureters of 16 children (11 boys and 5 girls). Dimercaptosuccinate renoscintigraphy confirmed small kidneys, with generally reduced tracer uptake in a total of three boys, all having VUR. Voiding ultrasonography detected transient renal pelvic dilation in 17 (71%) of the 24 kidneys with VUR and, strikingly, 16 of the 17 (94%) kidneys with high-grade VUR (grade III or more). This study effectively detected VUR in 0.8% of the neonates (mostly of high grades and predominantly in males) and voiding ultrasonography showed a decided usefulness for the detection of VUR. The male preponderance of VUR in neonates was considered to be due to the occurrence of congenitally small kidneys, with reflux found exclusively in males and easier ultrasound detection of VUR in male neonates because the majority of diagnoses are reported to be high grades of VUR."}

Committee on Quality Improvement. Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection.", "content": "Practice parameter: the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children. American Academy of Pediatrics. Committee on Quality Improvement. Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection. To formulate recommendations for health care professionals about the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of an initial urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and young children (ages 2 months to 2 years). Comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature, supplemented with consensus opinion of Subcommittee members. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Quality Improvement selected a Subcommittee composed of pediatricians with expertise in the fields of epidemiology and informatics, infectious diseases, nephrology, pediatric practice, radiology, and urology to draft the parameter. The Subcommittee, the AAP Committee on Quality Improvement, a review panel of office-based practitioners, and other groups within and outside the AAP reviewed and revised the parameter. The Subcommittee identified the population at highest risk of incurring renal damage from UTI-infants and young children with UTI and fever. A comprehensive bibliography on UTI in infants and young children was compiled. Literature was abstracted in a formal manner, and evidence tables were constructed. Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed to assess various strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation. The overall problem of managing UTI in children between 2 months and 2 years of age was conceptualized as an evidence model. The model depicts the relationship between the steps in diagnosis and management of UTI. The steps are divided into the following four phases: 1) recognizing the child at risk for UTI, 2) making the diagnosis of UTI, 3) short-term treatment of UTI, and 4) evaluation of the child with UTI for possible urinary tract abnormality. Phase 1 represents the recognition of the child at risk for UTI. Age and other clinical features define a prevalence or a prior probability of UTI, determining whether the diagnosis should be pursued. Phase 2 depicts the diagnosis of UTI. Alternative diagnostic strategies may be characterized by their cost, sensitivity, and specificity. The result of testing is the division of patients into groups according to a relatively higher or lower probability of having a UTI. The probability of UTI in each of these groups depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the test, but also on the prior probability of the UTI among the children being tested. In this way, the usefulness of a diagnostic test depends on the prior probability of UTI established in Phase 1. Phase 3 represents the short-term treatment of UTI. Alternatives for treatment of UTI may be compared, based on their likelihood of clearing the initial UTI. Phase 4 depicts the imaging evaluation of infants with the diagnosis of UTI to identify those with urinary tract abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Children with VUR are believed to be at risk for ongoing renal damage with subsequent infections, resulting in hypertension and renal failure. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy or surgical procedures such as ureteral reimplantation may prevent progressive renal damage. Therefore, identifying urinary abnormalities may offer the benefit of preventing hypertension and renal failure. Because the consequences of detection and early management of UTI are affected by subsequent evaluation and long-term management and, likewise, long-term management of patients with UTI depends on how they are detected at the outset, the Subcommittee elected to analyze the entire process from detection of UTI to the evaluation for, and consequences of, urinary tract abnormalities. The full analysis of these data can be found in the technical report. History of the literature review along with evidence-tables and a comprehensive bibliography also are available in the report.

To analyse the outcome of urinary tract reconstruction in children. Fifteen children with bladder exstrophy or neurogenic bladder, 4-18 years old, were followed in accordance with a predetermined program for bladder augmentation (13 pat) or continent urinary reservoir (2 pat). The follow-up time was 1.7-6.3 years, median 3.7 years. All were dry, though one case had occasional leaks. Three bladder neck reconstructions, two artificial sphincters, one sling plasty and one fistula closure with subsequent bladder neck injection were required. Bladder volumes were adequate for age at low pressures. Reflux resolved in 12/13 ureters. A boy with preoperative renal insufficiency was transplanted. Total renal function remained otherwise stable despite acidosis in one case and some glomerular impairment in all. Progressive parenchymal lesions were seen in combination with abundant mucus, infections and calculi only. Growth and bowel function was unaffected. Bone mineral density showed overall increase; some low values were not consistent between investigations. Urinary tract reconstruction in children results in continence and regression of reflux. Growth, bone mineralization and renal function are unimpaired during the first years, but irrigation of the bladder is essential to minimize the risk of urinary tract infection. However, glomerular function might be affected and the possible risk of metabolic complications in later life can only be determined by continuous close monitoring over an extended period of time.

The co-morbid conditions were: urinary tract infection, seven; spasticity, three; pressure sores, five; and deep venous thrombosis, one. The initial diagnosis was often other than heterotopic ossification. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated in all subjects. Following rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the range of motion improved in two patients. Heterotopic ossification can occur in patients with non-traumatic myelopathies and has risk factors and clinical features similar to patients with traumatic spinal cord injury.

In 38 children with proved P-fimbriated Escherichia coli acute pyelonephritis, Tc-99m DTPA dynamic renal scintigraphy in the zoom mode using deconvolution analysis was performed, and the results were compared with those of Tc-99m DMSA scans. From the dynamic study, six functional images of the mean time were generated. Each functional image was analyzed separately to search for focal areas of increased mean time within the kidney contour, especially over the kidney parenchyma. Time-activity curves from these areas were generated and analyzed. Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy showed generalized or focal decreased uptake in 32 (41.8%) kidneys, and deconvolution analysis of Tc-99m DTPA scintigraphy revealed pathologic renographic curves in 58 (77.6%) kidneys. Prolonged whole-kidney and normal renal parenchymal transit times (dilatation without obstruction) were found in 38 (50%) kidneys, whereas prolonged whole-kidney and renal parenchymal transit times (dilatation with obstruction) were observed in 20 (27.6%) kidneys. Separate analysis of each of the six functional images of the mean time showed focal areas of increased mean time in the kidney parenchyma of 11 kidneys. In five cases, time-activity curves from these areas showed a sharp increase of activity on the descending part of the curve, which might reflect the return of urine from the collecting system into kidney cortex (i.e., intrarenal reflux). These results showed that in a urinary tract with acute pyelonephritis, urodynamic changes may lead to obstructive nephropathy and intrarenal reflux. Tc-99m DTPA renal scintigraphy in the zoom mode using deconvolution analysis with six functional images of the mean time has proved to be a valuable method to evaluate acute pyelonephritis, thus allowing dynamic and morphologic analysis of the urinary tract at the same time."}

The normal range of values for quantitative SPECT of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake by the kidneys in children was studied. Renal functioning volume, percentage of injected dose per cubic centimeter of renal tissue (%ID/ cm3) and individual kidney uptake of 270 kidneys performed on 135 children, aged 2 wk-15 y, provided the basic data for this study. The accrual was part of the work-up of children with urinary tract infection where no structural or functional abnormalities of the renal tract could be established. Children were grouped according to age intervals, and a distribution chart was obtained with 2 SD above and below the mean of the values obtained for volume (%ID/cm3) and kidney uptake in each age group. A significant correlation was found between age and functional volume (r = 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.92; P = 0.000), and a significant inverse correlation was found between age and %ID/cm3 (r = -0.86; 95% CI, -0.88 to -0.82; P = 0.000). No statistically significant correlation was found between age and kidney uptake (r = -0.20; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.09; P = 0.001). It seems that the normal maturational changes in renal function observed in infants and newborns do not affect the kidney uptake of 99mTC-DMSA. Thus, quantitation of 99mTc-DMSA uptake by the kidneys can be used to assess changes in the individual renal function over time in this age group."}

The overall and single-kidney clearance in children with acute urinary tract infection was investigated retrospectively using the combination of the relative 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) uptake and the 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid clearance. There were 180 patients with both normal kidneys, 56 with clear unilateral abnormalities on DMSA scintigraphy and 11 with two abnormal kidneys. Half of the patients were younger than 2 y, and because of the progressive maturation of the renal function, they were not considered in the analysis of the absolute overall and single-kidney clearance; nevertheless, they were included in the analysis of the relative DMSA percentage uptake. When only one kidney was affected on DMSA scintigraphy, the clearance of the affected kidney was lower than on the normal side and often abnormally low. In these unilaterally affected kidneys, contralateral compensation mechanisms tended to occur, resulting in preservation of overall clearance. This compensation was probably not present only on the contralateral side. On the abnormal side, the clearance was normal in about half of the cases, probably because of intrarenal compensation occurring in regions not damaged by the infection. In addition to these compensation mechanisms, hyperfiltration was probably present in many cases of acute urinary tract infection with intact or unilaterally damaged kidneys."}

The serum and urine IL-6 responses remained elevated longer in the bacteremic group. Patients with clinical signs of pyelonephritis had higher serum and urine IL-6 concentrations than did other patients in the study population (P=.058, P<.01, respectively). IL-6 high responders had higher temperatures (P<.05) and C-reactive protein levels (P<.05, P<.01) than did low responders. The results demonstrate that IL-6 responses accompany febrile UTIs regardless of bacteremia and that the response reflects disease severity. The results suggest that IL-6 produced in the urinary tract can trigger the systemic host response in the absence of bacteremia."}

There was a good correlation between the two procedures in the majority of the cases (79), but in 21 cases, direct radionuclide cystography alone was positive and for 8 other children, direct contrast cystography showed a low-grade vesico-ureteric reflux even though radionuclide cystography was negative. When comparing the two procedures and taking into consideration the age of the patients we find that radionuclide cystography is more sensitive to detect vesico-ureteric reflux in the younger population (p < 0.02). This advantage is less clear for older children who more often present a low-grade reflux. Low radiation exposure is also a great advantage of radionuclide cystography, but anatomic definition is better with contrast cystography. It seems thus that the two procedures complement rather than rival each other. Their respective interest for evaluation of repeated urinary tract infection in children therefore depends on age, attain-ability of the procedure, and the possibility of a bladder or ureteral abnormality. Quite a few authors consider radionuclide cystography as at least as valid as contrast cystography, and even more sensitive. We have attempted to compare both procedures and to determine their respective role in repeated urinary tract infection exploration."}

When appropriate cutoff values are chosen, IL-6 had greatly improved specificity (86.4%, > 20 pg/ml) to demonstrate UTI and pneumonia, as compared to that using CRP (48%, > 40 mg/l). After three days' antibiotic treatment, IL-6 fell to control levels in children with UTI and pneumonia, while CRP remained elevated.

A correlation between urinary tract infection, vesicoureteral reflux and voiding disorders has increasingly been reported. Voiding dysfunction increases the incidence of recurrent urinary tract infection, induces and perpetuates vesicoureteral reflux, even after surgical antireflux treatment, and may result in permanent renal damage. The resolution of the primary cause with voiding normalization is essential to achieve good results in the treatment of secondary problems such as urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux. Thirty seven children with vesicoureteral reflux secondary to voiding disorders were diagnosed and treated between 1990 and 1995 (five years). Forty-nine ureters were studied. The subjects became symptomatic between 1 month and 13 years of age, with the occurrence of urinary tract infection. All children were neurologically and morphologically normal. Symptoms suggesting bladder instability were detected in 34 (91.9%) and dysfunctional sphincter obstruction in three (8.1%).

Children with suspected APN were transferred to our department for DMSA renal scans. Seventy-two children (ages 1 week to 15 years) had DMSA planar and SPECT imaging performed twice because of clinical or laboratory suspicion of repeated APN. In addition, radiographic voiding cystourethrography was also performed in all cases. The presence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was graded on a scale of 0 to 5. New lesions were observed with SPECT in 56 kidneys and with planar scintigraphy in 38 kidneys. No patients had a negative result of Tc-99m DMSA renal SPECT who also had a positive Tc-99m DMSA planar result. The degree of VUR as related to APN was diagnosed better with SPECT than with planar scintigraphy (46 compared with 30 and 10 compared with 8, respectively). There is a significant difference (P < 0.05) between the diagnostic ability of these two methods to identify the increased tendency of repeated APN to occur with high-grade VUR compared with low-grade or no VUR. High-grade VUR is more commonly associated with renal injury than is low-grade or no VUR. If only Tc-99m DMSA renal planar scintigraphy is performed, renal scarring may be underestimated. Our results suggest that Tc-99m DMSA renal SPECT, rather than planar scintigraphy, should be used routinely in children with a clinical suspicion of APN, especially for those with scarred kidneys and high-grade VUR."}

This prospective study had three aims: (1) to evaluate the medium-term evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities, to find a prognostic criterion of scintigraphic evolution; (2) to assess the correlation between the severity of early or late scintigraphic damage and selected clinical factors; and (3) to compare the permanent scintigraphic renal scars with intravenous urography (IVU) 2 years after the acute infection. Seventy-four children (mean age 32 months), presenting with a first clinical episode of pyelonephritis and an initial scintigraphic abnormality, were included in the study. Patients with a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), uropathy other than vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) and a relapse of acute pyelonephritis were excluded.

Fifty-seven children (77%) still have scintigraphic abnormalities of varying severity (7 atrophic kidneys). Initial relative DMSA uptake of less than 45% results in a worse scintigraphic prognosis. The age of the child has no bearing on the severity of the initial renal involvement or on the evolution of the scintigraphic abnormalities. The rapid introduction of antibiotics (< 12 h) significantly improves the scintigraphic prognosis (P < 0.01). The presence of reflux (n = 39) leads to more serious initial damage, but we did not find any effect on later evolution in this study, in which all reflux was low grade in nature. Among the 43 children who had an IVU, 5 showed typical urographic and scintigraphic renal scars in the corresponding region and 38 showed a normal IVU with 28 cases of scintigraphic abnormalities. A DMSA scan is more sensitive than IVU for the detection of renal scarring after a first episode of APN."}

The long-term results of simple high-pressure balloon dilation in the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) and ureteral strictures were evaluated. A total of 77 consecutive patients were treated: 40 had UPJO and 37 ureteral strictures. The etiology of the obstruction included congenital UPJO, previous stones, sequelae of endoscopic and open surgery, radiotherapy, and urinary tract reconstruction. A retrograde ureteroscopic approach was used. Evaluation included clinical and radiographic examinations and renal scintigraphy with diuretic wash-out. The procedure was repeated in 21 cases. The median follow-up was 29 months. The procedure was considered successful if it left the patient asymptomatic and with improved renographic function and drainage. The overall success rate was 70%. The best results were obtained in strictures secondary to stones, with a success rate of 94%, and in strictures secondary to reconstructive and ureteroscopic surgery, with a success rate of 91%. In congenital UPJO, the results were less encouraging: in patients with a symptom debut after the age of 18 years, balloon dilation was successful in 57% of cases; in patients with symptom debut before the age of 18 years, success was achieved in only 25% of cases. There were no major complications. It was concluded that simple high-pressure balloon dilation is a safe and reasonably effective technique for the management of most ureteral strictures and congenital UPJO with symptom debut in adult life. Balloon dilation seems to have no place in the treatment of primary congenital UPJO in children."}

The objective of the present paper was to review the use of the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in urinary tract infection at British Columbia's Children's Hospital to determine the frequency of cortical defects and the association between vesico-ureteric reflux and the presence of cortical defects in children with urinary tract infection. A total of 129 consecutive children with a urinary tract infection referred for a DMSA scan in a 2-year period (January 1992-January 1994) were retrospectively studied. The results were analysed in terms of kidneys, and the incidence of cortical defects was determined. Eighty-eight patients (68%) had a radiographic micturating cysto-urethrogram within 6 months of the DMSA scan, and in this group the relationship of defects with vesico-ureteric reflux was determined. Overall, 81/258 (31%) of kidneys had a cortical defect on a DMSA scan. Of those who had a micturating cysto-urethrogram, 53/176 (30%) kidneys had vesico-ureteric reflux, and of those that had reflux, 21/53 (40%) had a cortical defect on a DMSA scan. In the group of children without reflux, 38/123 (31%) had a cortical defect. Renal cortical scan defects are common findings in paediatric urinary infection, and frequently occur in the absence of vesico-ureteric reflux. These defects represent either established scars or acute pyelonephritis that can proceed to scarring. The micturating cysto-urethrogram alone is insufficient as a screening modality to identify those kidneys at risk of renal scarring."}

In an attempt to differentiate acute pyelonephritis from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we measured serum procalcitonin levels, a recently described marker of infection. We compared it with other commonly used inflammatory markers and evaluated its ability to predict renal involvement as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Serum C-reactive protein, leukocyte counts, and procalcitonin levels were measured in 80 children, 1 month to 16 years of age, admitted for suspected pyelonephritis. Renal involvement was assessed by 99mTe-DMSA scintigraphy in the first 5 days after admission. The examination was repeated at least 3 months later if the first result was abnormal. In lower UTI, the mean procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.38 micrograms/L +/- 0.19 compared with 5.37 micrograms/L +/- 1.9 in pyelonephritis. In these two groups, respectively, leukocyte counts were 10939/mm3 +/- 834 and 17429/mm3 +/- 994, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were 30.3 mg/L +/- 7.6 and 120.8 mg/L +/- 8.9. When inflammatory markers were correlated to the severity of the renal lesion as ranked by DMSA scintigraphy, we found a highly significant correlation with plasma levels of PCT, but borderline significance with CRP and none with leukocyte counts. Patients without vesicoureteral reflux had a mean PCT of 5.16 micrograms/L +/- 2.33, which was not significantly different from that in patients with reflux who had a mean PCT of 5.76 micrograms/L +/- 3.49. For the prediction of renal lesions at admission, CRP had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 26.1%. The sensitivity and specificity of PCT were 70.3% and 82.6%, respectively.

A psoas abscess is a rare clinical entity that presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. In this retrospective study, we reviewed gallium-67 scan findings in cases of psoas abscess to determine the specific uptake pattern and the usefulness of 67Ga scans in diagnosis and management. Fifteen psoas abscess lesions in 13 patients who had undergone a 67Ga scan during an 8-year period were found in the hospital computer. All but two of the patients had been diagnosed as having fever of unknown origin, urinary tract infection or another irrelevant disease prior to the 67Ga scan. Of the 15 psoas abscess lesions, 12 (80%) could be clearly diagnosed on the basis of the specific 67Ga uptake pattern, in which: (1) the oblique direction of the 67Ga-avid lesion correlates with the orientation of the psoas muscle from the lumbar region to the hip joint region; (2) the lesion does not cross the abdominal midline; (3) the lesion goes through the inguinal region; and (4) the lesion involves at least two-thirds of the whole length of the psoas muscle. The specific features may help in the differentiation of psoas abscess from other intra-abdominal lesions or normal bowel distribution, especially with single-photon emission tomographic images. In 7 of 13 patients (53.8%) the 67Ga scan findings contributed to the clinical management of the patients by first detecting the focus of the infection. Multiple concomitant 67Ga-avid lesions were found in ten patients. In conclusion, the specific features as well as the whole-body survey with 67Ga scan are useful and important in the diagnosis of psoas abscesses and the detection of unexpected concomitant multiple infectious foci in clinically suspicious infectious disease patients."}

A system for defining renal scarring on ultrasound is proposed and compared with DMSA scintigraphy. Renal scarring was assessed with ultrasound in children following urinary tract infection (UTI) using the following criteria: (1) proximity of sinus echoes to cortical surface; (2) loss of pyramids; (3) irregularity of outline; (4) loss of definition of capsular echo; and (5) calyceal dilatation. Three hundred and thirty-nine consecutive ultrasound scans (US) and DMSA scintigrams, comprising 648 kidneys, were performed and reported blindly and the results were compared. Using DMSA scintigraphy as the gold standard, ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 93% and a negative predictive value of 95%. Ultrasound disagreed with DMSA scintigraphy in 5.2% of kidneys. On review of the cases of disagreement where arbitration was possible by comparison with other imaging, ultrasound was incorrect in 10 kidneys and DMSA was incorrect in 13. We conclude that the sensitivity in the ultrasound detection of renal scarring can be greatly improved using this method. If no scars were detected at ultrasound an alternative explanation for an abnormal DMSA scintigram should be sought."}

Statistically significant differences in the prevalence of pathological findings in imaging between these groups were shown. When children after the RVU are taken into account renal scintigraphy supplies us with objective and precise data about the renal scarring degree. In this group repeated renal scintigraphy should be warranted. After the reconstructive procedures due to hydronephrosis the images from ultrasonography and renal scintigraphy correlate well. Ultrasonography is a golden standard for screening these patients. Statistically significant higher degree of renal scarring in renal scintigraphy in patients after urinary tract infections without urinary tract defect proves the important role of infections in the pathogenesis of these changes. Children with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections should be submitted to renal scintigraphy imaging on regularly basis, as a risk group of higher chronic pyelonephritis prevalence."}

It is well known to be associated with hypertension and renal failure. This has led to regular long-term follow-up of patients, clinically and radiologically. We report the findings of renal imaging in a cohort of 37 patients with reflux nephropathy 15 or more years after successful surgical correction of vesico-ureteric reflux. The degree of renal scarring had been assessed and recorded at the beginning of the study utilizing a score on the original X-ray films. The scar scores of the current intravenous urography (IVU) imaging underestimate the degree of scarring in 35% of cases when compared with the previously recorded scar scores of the original IVU images suggesting a reduction in the renal scar score in some cases over the years. In the current review, concomitant renal images obtained by IVU and 99mTc dimercapto succinic acid (DMSA) scanning were in agreement for scar scoring in only 50% of cases. The original scar score by IVU or the current scar score by either technique does not correlate with blood pressure, urine albumin excretion or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conclude that serial long-term two-dimensional renal imaging in children with damaged kidneys who no longer have vesico-ureteric reflux, does not provide additional information that will alter clinical management. However, the changes in renal volume and echogenicity were not assessed in this study."}

NA plus UVA light caused damage to the double-stranded DNA fragment at consecutive guanine residues, whereas damage to the single-stranded DNA fragment was caused at single guanines and thymines. The formation of 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine in native DNA exceeded that in denatured DNA at high NA concentrations. The ESR spin destruction method suggested that DNA damage was caused through electron transfer from guanine residues to photoexcited NA. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that NA can cause skin cancer through DNA damage mediated by its photoactivation."}

The children were randomly allocated to medical (n=147) or surgical (n=140) management and DMSA studies were performed during the follow up period at least 6 months after any urinary tract infection. Abnormal images were classified into four types: (1) large polar hypodensity with normal renal outline; (2) peripheral photon deficient defect(s) in a non-deformed kidney; (3) small renal image with normal contour; and (4) peripheral defect(s) with resultant irregularity of the renal outline.

The prevalence rate is hazardous since data from the literature are confusing with respect to reflux nephropathy, chronic pyelonephritis and renal hypoplasia. The pathology of such lesions consists in focal interstitial fibrosis. When the first pyelonephritic attack occurs during infancy, renal growth may be compromised. The current approach of renal scar assessment is based on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children, particularly in the youngest age groups. There is a risk for progressive deterioration of renal function in these children if aggravating factors such as gross reflux and/or outflow obstruction of the urinary tract are present. In this review the pros and cons of available scintigraphic and radiological imaging techniques for the work-up of these children are presented. Ultrasound can be used in the acute phase to exclude obstruction but can not reliably show transient or permanent parenchymal lesions. The presence of reflux can be established with X-ray or direct nuclide cystography. The X-ray technique gives good morphological information and has a grading system with prognostic relevance. Both techniques are invasive and great care must be taken to keep the radiation burden down with the X-ray technique. Indirect nuclide cystography following a renographic study is non-invasive but has a lower sensitivity than direct techniques. More experience is needed with the indirect technique to evaluate the consequences of its apparently low sensitivity. Urography has a limited place in the acute work-up of urinary tract infection but can be used to look for renal scarring 1-2 years after an acute pyelonephritis. The 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan can be used during the acute UTI to show pyelonephritic lesions with good accuracy and/or during the follow-up after six months to show permanent lesions.

All evaluations were made blindly. Of the total 314 kidneys, 80 (25%) were abnormal at initial scintigraphy. Of these 80 kidneys, 44 (55%) had normalized at follow-up. Of the 234 initially normal kidneys, 29 (12%) were abnormal at follow-up. One year after UTI, abnormalities were seen in 59 children at scintigraphy and in 18 children at urography. Renal area involvement was larger and split function abnormalities more common in kidneys that were abnormal at both scintigraphy and urography than in kidneys with only scintigraphic abnormalities. Quantitation of renal area involvement and split renal function at early scintigraphy would seem to be useful in identifying patients at risk of developing renal damage. Urography at 1 year after infection identified mainly those with the most severe scintigraphic abnormalities. The clinical importance of scintigraphic abnormalities that are not confirmed by urography is not known."}

The aims of this study were to validate 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy appearances with histopathological features of scarring; to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc-DMSA and ultrasound for the detection of renal scarring; to compare planar, pinhole and SPECT techniques when using 99mTc-DMSA; and to compare 99mTc-DMSA and ultrasound renal length measurement. Reflux nephropathy was induced in large white pigs using established methods. To ensure that the abnormalities detected were scars and not inflammatory changes, the pigs were not studied until 3 mo after the treated episode of acute pyelonephritis confirmed by 99mTc-DMSA. Twenty pigs were enrolled in the study. Eleven reached the end point, but only nine pigs (18 kidneys) were available for analysis. Thirty-four scars were identified pathologically; 24 were present macroscopically and a further 10 were seen only on microscopy. Technetium-99m-DMSA abnormalities correlated with scars histopathologically with an accuracy of 92% versus that of ultrasound, 75% (p < 0.001). Technetium-99m-DMSA more accurately identified scarring with a higher sensitivity (76% versus 29%) and specificity (98% versus 92%) than ultrasound. On the 99mTc-DMSA study, pinhole imaging had the highest accuracy (92%) when compared with planar (90%) and SPECT (87%) data. These differences were not statistically significant. Renal lengths as measured on 99mTc-DMSA more closely correlated with length measurement at pathological examination than ultrasound. Technetium-99m-DMSA measurement was, on average, 6% higher than pathology, and ultrasound was, on average, 22% lower. Technetium-99m-DMSA appears to be the preferred method for the detection of renal cortical scarring and accurate renal length measurement when compared with ultrasound examination."}

One hundred thirty renal scintigraphies were evaluated retrospectively in 38 children (21% boys, 79% girls; age range 1 mo-21 yr; mean age 7.2 yr) referred for evaluation during an acute clinical urinary tract infection and for follow-up studies. Twelve topographical regions were designated on each kidney. Each area was graded for severity of decreased radionuclide localization: mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2) or marked (Grade 3). Early posterior views of MAG3 studies were compared to delayed posterior GH images. In all patients, both studies were performed on the same day. Eighty-two studies were performed during an acute clinical infection and 48 were performed as follow-up. Seventy-seven percent of the studies had focal cortical lesions. Of all the cortical lesions identified by GH, MAG3 detected 74% (match lesions). A comparable percentage of lesions was identified in each region by both studies. GH scintigraphy detected 261 lesions (63 Grade 1, 149 Grade 2 and 49 Grade 3), and MAG3 detected 201 lesions (37 Grade 1, 117 Grade 2 and 47 Grade 3). MAG3 was unable to recognize 60 lesions identified by GH studies in 11 patients (mismatch lesions). Of these, 41% (26 of 63) were Grade 1, 21% (32 of 149) were Grade 2 and 4% (2 of 49) were Grade 3. In three cases, MAG3 identified lesions not seen by GH (reverse mismatch); all had acute symptomatic infection. These data document that MAG3 in the early phase of the study (1-2 min) can detect Grade 2 to Grade 3 cortical lesions in patients with pyelonephritis, but it is less effective in detecting Grade 1 lesions."}

To evaluate whether intrarenal surgery for branched calculi remains valid in the light of current new techniques, e.g. percutaneous nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. Between January 1978 and October 1984, 44 patients (24 male and 20 female, mean age 42.5 years, range 14-66) underwent complex surgery for large stones, requiring opening of the renal pelvis and a transparenchymal approach to the calices; 47 renal units were operated in 49 procedures. The evaluation before surgery included creatinine and blood nitrogen levels, blood pressure measurement, urine culture, abdominal plain X-ray (44 patients), intravenous urography (42) and isotopic renography with renal scintigraphy (five). Renal lithiasis was categorized and all patients underwent extended pyelolithotomy with a transparenchymal approach, achieved by partial nephrectomy (six patients), radial paravascular nephrotomy (10), posterior lower nephrolithotomy (29), resection of the posterior segment (two), and posterior segmentotomy and reconstruction (2); 16 operations were performed under ischaemia. In October 1996, the patients were clinically evaluated by serum creatinine levels (42), urine cultures (42), abdominal plain X-ray (42), IVU (34), isotopic renography (eight), renal ultrasonography (eight) and blood pressure measurement (44). The mean follow-up was 14.8 years. The major postoperative complications were; residual stones (six patients), fistula with ureteric stenosis (one, with a permanent nephrostomy), toxic temporary hepatic failure (one), femoral arterial embolism (one, resolved using a Fogarty catheter) and recurrent large stones (two, operated 1 and 5 years later). From 1984 to 1996, 19 patients had recurrent stones and two underwent dialysis. In October 1996, the renal function of 47 renal units was stable or normal in 36 (77%), reduced in seven (15%) and lost in four (8%); 24 patients were hypertensive (12 preoperatively), nine have urinary tract infection, three are positive for hepatitis B or C virus, and lithiasis has recurred in 15 renal units. Intrarenal surgery, conducted using modern anatomical guidelines, was an effective treatment for renal branched stones. The long-term results are satisfactory after appropriate correction of the urinary tract, with the consequent prevention of stasis and chronic infection. The definitive comparison between surgical and combined endoscopic/extracorporeal methods will only become clear when there is a comparable follow-up. Currently, surgery remains preferable in patients with giant calculi, a small pelvis and prevalent calyceal development."}

Obvious scintigraphic abnormalities were detected in 14 children (15 kidneys): 12 kidneys showed focal cortical defects and 3 were small and deformed. Ultrasound was normal in 7 of the 15 kidneys with abnormal scintigraphy and in all the kidneys with normal scintigraphy. Among the 12 kidneys with focal cortical lesions, 8 kidneys returned to normal or improved considerably 2-12 months after initial work-up. In conclusion, in children over 5 years admitted with a first symptomatic UTI, the frequency of scintigraphic abnormalities is high and a strategy based only on ultrasound data would miss about 50% of the abnormal kidneys."}

We reviewed the medical records of a consecutive sample of 125 children that underwent VCUG in our hospital between January 1995 and June 1996. Of the 125 VCUGs, 100 were normal, 13 showed vesicoureteric reflux grade II or higher, and 12 of them presented with other anomalies. The indication for VCUG was febrile UTI in 54 children, hydronephrosis detected prenatally in 12 and other causes in 60 children. It is important to note that children with vesicoureteric reflux presented as febrile UTI or fetal hydronephrosis. The age was significantly lower in the reflux group (p < 0.01). Eleven of the 13 children with vesicoureteric reflux were less than one year of age. Ultrasound anomalies and renal scarring in Tc99 DMSA were seen in a larger proportion in the reflux group. Preliminary X-rays showed anomalies in only 3 of 125 cases. 1) Vesicoureteric reflux is related to febrile UTI and fetal hydronephrosis. The other indications are questionable. 2) VCGU is not recommended following the first UTI in the evaluation of children 6 years of age or older who have a normal ultrasound and Tc99 DMSA. 3) VCUG could be substituted by a nuclear cystogram in girls who do not have a history of voiding dysfunction. 4) A preliminary X-ray is not justified."}

All the children had serum vitamin A and beta-carotene measurements and nutritional evaluation. Renal scarring was assessed by technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) scanning. Nutritional status of all the patients was within normal limits and not different between the groups. Mean (SD) serum vitamin A and beta-carotene concentrations were not significantly different between the patients with and without renal scarring (vitamin A 53.2 (22.6)/46.8 (17.0) micrograms/dl and beta-carotene 232.3 (201.3)/272.4 (86.0) micrograms/dl respectively). However, when the patients with renal scarring and with greater than 10% difference among the DMSA uptakes of their kidneys (11 cases) were evaluated, a significant negative correlation was determined between the serum vitamin A concentrations and the magnitude of the difference in uptakes of each kidney. The same relation was not true for serum beta-carotene concentrations. This study demonstrated a relation between serum vitamin A concentrations and magnitude of hypoactivity in 99mTc DMSA scanning in kidneys with advanced scarring."}

Since uropathy started to be diagnosed by means of ultrasonography during the prenatal period, paediatric urologists have experienced a major increase in neonatal consultations, which involve healthy children without any symptoms of urinary tract infection. Thereby the criteria for an adequate treatment of these uropathies have been modified. With our study, we intend to analyse the changes regarding the management of such cases in our Service for the last 10 years. 294 cases prenatally diagnosed and confirmed by means of postnatal sonography have been reviewed, taking into account the type of explorations carried out in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Ultrasonography, cystourethrography, pyelography, scintigraphy and isotopic renography have determined both degree of obstruction and the renal function of the patient so as to value the kidney viability. We have found 169 cases of pelviureteral junction (PUJ) obstruction, 52 of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), 48 of megaureter, 13 of ureterocele, 8 of ectopic ureter, 5 of urethral valves, 26 of multicystic dysplasic kidney, 35 of renal duplication, 4 of renal cyst, 2 of ectopic kidney, 2 of renal agenesia, 3 of bladder diverticular, 1 of renal hypoplasia and 1 of Bolande's tumour. 32 children were operated upon due to PUJ obstruction, 27 due to VUR, 14 megaureter, 21 due to ureterocele and ectopic ureter, 5 due to valves, 5 multicystic kidneys, 3 vesical diverticula, 2 renal cysts and 1 due to Bolande's tumour. From a total of 367 diagnoses, 109 patients have undergone an operation, which equals a 29.7%. The rest of the patients have been subject to a medical follow-up. Only 3 patients had to be operated on due to an aggravation of their obstruction. To sum up, the main advantage of prenatal diagnosis is that it presents the patient without urinary infection. Double-diuretic scintigraphy has proved to be the best option to explore the obstruction when dilated despite its limitations in the case of deficient renal function. The most frequent diagnosis, which has undergone a major increase in the last few years, is PUJ obstruction in the manner of pyelic dilatation. Many of them are not confirmed postnatally and most of them (more than 70%) do not need surgical treatment."}

One hundred fifteen children with normal scintigraphic or pathologic findings (other than acute pyelonephritis) were excluded from further study; 170 patients with abnormal scintigraphic findings underwent follow-up scintigraphic scanning 60-90 days later. When pathologic structures other than acute pyelonephritis were not considered, the diagnostic value of gray-scale US was poor, with a sensitivity of 45.5%, a specificity of 86.6%, a positive predictive value of 88.8%, and a negative predictive value of only 40.6%. In regard to future renal scarring, gray-scale US had a positive predictive value of 67.7%, a negative predictive value of 40%, and a likelihood ratio of 1.16. Abnormal Doppler findings helped predict future scarring with a positive predictive value of 85.7%, a negative predictive value of 37.2%, a very low sensitivity of 26.9%, a high specificity of 90.6%, and a likelihood ratio of 2.87. Positive US Doppler findings in children with clinically suspected acute pyelonephritis indicate the need for immediate treatment. A positive initial gray-scale US examination does not predict future renal scarring, but a positive Doppler examination indicates a high probability of scarring. Negative gray-scale or Doppler US does not exclude a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and it cannot predict an absence of future scarring."}

For reasons that are not yet completely understood, a minority of UTIs in children progress to renal scarring, hypertension and renal insufficiency. Clinical presentation of UTI in children may be nonspecific, and the appropriateness of certain diagnostic tests remains controversial. The diagnostic work-up should be tailored to uncover functional and structural abnormalities such as dysfunctional voiding, vesicoureteral reflux and obstructive uropathy. A more aggressive work-up, including renal cortical scintigraphy, ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography, is recommended for patients at greater risk for pyelonephritis and renal scarring, including infants less than one year of age and all children who have systemic signs of infection concomitant with a UTI.

A descriptive and retrospective study of the clinical records of 65 patients under 14 years of age with urinary tract infection (UTI) seen at our institution between 1994 and 1995 and on whom a DMSA scan had been performed was carried out. The study groups was formed by the fifteen children with scintigraphic findings compatible with renal scarring. The fifty children with normal DMSA scans were used as controls. Renal scarring was found more often in patients over one year of age (p < 0.05), in those with reinfections (p < 0.001) and in those kidneys with grade III vesicoureteral reflux (VUR, p < 0.05). The most severe lesions, with reduction of renal size, shape abnormalities and diminished uptake of the tracer were found together with VUR. The renal sonogram performed during the acute stage of the UTI was able to detect only four of the six children most severely affected. Delaying the practice of the DMSA scan until 6 months after the last episode of bacteriuria would allow selection of those patients at the highest risk of progressive renal damage. This guideline would reduce scintigraphic studies 30 to 90%, since it would avoid repeated studies in those children with abnormal findings in the acute stage. The practice of the radioisotope study only in a reduced subset of patients selected on the basis of risk criteria such as recurrent UTI, VUR or suspected pyelonephritis does not allow detection of all scars."}

However, long-term follow-up is needed to finally determine whether an antirefluxive ureteric implantation is required to protect the upper urinary tract in patients with ileal low-pressure bladder substitutions."}

We treated 21 patients a mean of 37 years old who had ureteropelvic junction obstruction with ureteroscopy and without preoperative stenting. Endoluminal ultrasound was performed in all cases for imaging the periureteral anatomy. A minimum of 1 year of followup is available in all cases. Success was defined as pain-free status with resolution of obstruction on diuretic renal scintigraphy. Success was achieved in 17 of 21 patients (81%). Complications included stent irritation, postoperative urinary tract infection and stent displacement requiring repositioning in 1 case each. Crossing vessels in 57% of the patients affected success (67 versus 100% in those with and without crossing vessels, respectively). No patient had significant hemorrhage. Ureteroscopic endopyelotomy without preoperative stenting is effective and safe for ureteropelvic junction obstruction."}

Renal cortical scanning for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is presented as an example of an existing nuclear medicine study that is accurate and cost-effective, but has not yet taken a major place in the imaging armamentarium. In this discussion, the cortical scan is endorsed as the primary imaging tool for children presenting with acute urinary infection."}

The objective of this study was to compare the findings of renal ultrasonography and 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy in children with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection to determine which method is better in detecting patients at risk of renal injury or reflux. Thirty-three children between 0.2 and 12.3 years of age with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection were studied by means of clinical and laboratory assessment, renal ultrasonography and 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy. In 24 patients (72.7%) a voiding cystourethrography was made. The patients were divided into two groups, those under 2 years of age (n = 14) and those over 2 years old (n = 19). Cortical scintigraphy showed renal changes in 23 patients (69.7%) and ultrasonography showed renal changes in 2 (6.1%; p < 0.05). Children over 2 years of age had a higher incidence of renal lesions than did younger children (84.2% vs 50%; p < 0.05). There were no differences between girls and boys. Reflux was demonstrated in 13 patients (54.2%). Among those kidneys which presented abnormal cortical scintigraphy, vesicoureteral reflux was present in 76.5% of the studies. Furthermore, of those with abnormal ultrasonography vesicoureteral reflux was present in 17.6%. We found a high incidence of renal involvement in children with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection. The cortical scintigraphy is more sensitive than ultrasonography in detecting renal changes. The incidence of vesicoureteral reflux in febrile urinary tract infection is high. When there is a renal cortical defect the risk of reflux is higher. This suggests that cortical scintigraphy should be added to the initial examination of children with their first acute febrile urinary tract infection and this could be supplemented by voiding cystourethrography alone, with ultrasonography having a secondary role."}

A great variety of different antimicrobial chemotherapeutics is available for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Influencing the course of chronic diseases is a problem because recurrent diseases may result in disturbances of renal and bladder functions as well as in irreversible damages of the renal parenchyma. The present investigations are expected to clarify whether an effective prevention of reinfection in patients with chronically recurrent urinary tract infection is possible by a regular administration of L-methionine (Acimethin). 33 female patients were included in the examinations. Following acute disease, 23 females (aged: 47.4 +/- 13.3 years) were treated with 3 x 1 tablet of Acimethin (L-methionine) daily over a period of 26 months. Ten female patients (aged: 47.4 +/- 12.2 years) taking 1 tablet of Nevigramon (nalidixic acid) three times daily over 21.6 months served as a control group. Before starting treatment and in the middle of the therapy period control examinations were performed and following the last drug administration so as to assess the therapeutic result. No acute infection occurred during L-methionine treatment. All parameters of inflammation (leucocyte count, C-reactive protein, blood sedimentation rate, alpha 2-globulin concentration) were in the normal range; no impairment of renal function was observed. Although L-methionine, i.e. nalidixic acid, did not yield any significant changes in the range of bacteria, the adherence of uropathogenic microorganisms to the cells of the urinary tract was reduced. Before L-methionine treatment, the average load of the uroepithelial cells was 95.9 +/- 73.6 bacteria per cell. When the observation period was completed, 51.2 +/- 56.4 bacteria per cell were registered (p < 0.03). During nalidixic acid treatment, the rate of adherence was reduced from 74.0 +/- 88.4 to 34.4 +/- 37.8 bacteria per cell (p < 0.25). During L-methionine treatment, no Escherichia coli strains that are able to produce hemolysin or to form aerobactine were found. Among agents adhering to uroepithelial cells, however, an increase in their ability to produce mannose-resistant hemagglutination was conspicuous. L-methionine is suitable to prevent reinfection with chronic urinary tract infection. The therapeutic result is essentially due to its influence on bacterial cytoadherence. In contrast to the established recommendations concerning the prevention of reinfection by the use of antibiotics and sulphonamides selecting resistant strains during long-term treatment, nothing is known about the development of resistance to L-methionine."}

These levels were related to the acute inflammatory response in the kidneys and later renal scarring, as determined by acute and 1-y follow-up with 99mTC-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy (DMSA). The concentrations of the soluble receptors were measured using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The urinary levels of sTNF-RI were significantly higher in children with acute pyelonephritis (median 1320 pg/mmol) than in children with non-renal fever, children 6 weeks after acute pyelonephritis and healthy controls (873, 251 and 477 pg/mumol, respectively). Median sTNF-RII urine levels were also higher in acute pyelonephritis (4123 pg/mumol) than in the three control groups (2000, 964 and 1850 pg/mumol, respectively). In contrast, the highest urinary sIL-6R concentrations were found in healthy children (median 420 pg/mumol), compared to those with acute pyelonephritis (235 pg/mumol), children with non-renal fever and children 6 weeks after pyelonephritis (137 and 50 pg/mumol, respectively). No significant difference was found in any of the urinary soluble receptor levels in children with or without DMSA uptake defects at the acute or the 1-y follow-up scintigraphy. In conclusion, although the urinary soluble TNF receptor levels were higher during acute pyelonephritis, this observation was not useful for deciding which children needed follow-up after acute pyelonephritis."}

Helical scanning technology has also greatly increased the quality and usefulness of the information CT provides. Most uncomplicated cases of acute renal infection in adults do not require imaging for diagnosis and treatment.

Renal ultrasound was normal in all siblings and none developed hypertension. The results indicate that low-grade sterile VUR may not play a major role in renal scarring, but this may not be the case with high-grade sterile VUR.

Children with well-documented UTIs should be evaluated based on their age and presenting symptoms. Infants and young children require imaging, usually with a cystogram and sonogram of the kidneys and bladder. Older girls with febrile UTIs and boys at any age should also be considered for urinary tract imaging. Renal cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc-DMSA has emerged as the imaging study of choice for acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring in children with UTIs. Treatment of UTIs in children ideally commences with culture-specific antimicrobial therapy, although treatment may be started in sick children before culture results are available. Short-course treatment (3-5 days) is sufficient for children with acute uncomplicated lower UTIs. Children with acute pyelonephritis require 10 to 14 days of antibiotics, which can be administered on an outpatient basis in older infants and children who are not toxic, as long as good compliance is expected. Patients with first-time UTIs who require imaging should be maintained on low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis until their workup is completed. Treatment of ABU does not seem necessary if the urinary tract is otherwise normal. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for children with frequent symptomatic recurrences of UTI and for those with known VUR.

Previous investigations have shown that the determination of two acute-phase proteins in the urine, C-reactive protein (CRPu) and alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2-MGu), allows a noninvasive diagnosis of acute renal graft dysfunction. A reliable differentiation between rejection and urinary tract infection can be made only when considering the C-reactive protein in serum and urine at the same time (CRPs:CRPu ratio). Therefore, a diagnostic procedure independent of parameters other than urinary proteins is needed. As granulocytes play only a minor role in graft rejection but are a common feature in urinary tract infection, we determined a marker of granulocytes (myeloperoxidase) in urine (MPOu). Eighty-nine renal transplant recipients were included in the study. In normal courses, CRPu, alpha2-MGu, and MPOu were within the normal range. In 15 cases of acute interstitial rejection, an increased excretion of CRPu and alpha2-MGu could be confirmed, but MPOu could not be detected. On the occasion of acute vascular rejection (n=6), with the exception of one case, MPOu could not be observed. The pattern of the three urinary proteins differed in urinary tract infections (n=40): MPOu could be detected in all cases, CRPu in 50% of cases, and alpha2-MGu in 73% of cases.

Monitoring CRP over time may be used to assess for recrudescent disease, a secondary process or ineffective therapy. In addition CRP appears to be suited to most applications for which the ESR is used but offers many advantages. At present there are no objective outcome-based clinical trial data to justify using CRP values alone, whether elevated or normal, as a basis for management decisions regarding instituting or withholding antimicrobial therapy, or its early discontinuance for patients suspected of having neonatal sepsis, meningitis, bacteremia or pneumonia, regardless of immune status. In addition, because of significant inconsistencies among studies for which CRP has been applied to differential diagnosis of bacterial vs. viral diseases, including meningitis, acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infection, we cannot recommend it for this purpose. Data do not support a role for CRP in differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis or for localizing urinary tract infections."}

An automated algorithm for reorientation and centring of the SPET images was used to minimize inter-observer variability. Reduced uptake and contour defects showed different localization on planar and SPET imaging. Coincidence of defects on both types of image was low. We also noted a dependence on defect frequency content for detectability. Image contrast played a noticeable role in the detection of defects. Differences in contrast between SPET and planar images may be responsible for the variable success in the detection of defects. Contour defects are seen more frequently on tomographic slices, whereas reduced uptake defects are seen more frequently on planar images. A difference is also noted between the cortical and calyceal zones for differently contrasted lesions. SPET and planar DMSA images can potentially provide a different diagnosis of renal lesions."}

These adhesins facilitate countercurrent ascension of bacteria in the ureter towards the upper urinary tract and can make the bacteria resistant to certain antibiotics. Testing for fimbriae protein can be useful in clinical practice when investigating the aetiology of APN in the absence of demonstrated reflux. A latex test should soon be available to facilitate the detection of fimbriae protein."}

Established renal scarring represents areas of the kidney that imaging reveals to be damaged at presentation for medical management of urinary tract infection. New renal scarring represents new renal damage in parts of the kidney that imaging reveals to be normal at presentation. We attempted to characterize patients in whom new renal scars developed while they were under our care. In 1988 a data base was started to identify patients with new renal scarring. All patients presenting with urinary tract infections were enrolled. Our data base has 250 possible fields per event with multiple events per patient. More than 2,100 patients have been enrolled to date. All patients with pyelonephritis, defined as a febrile urinary tract infection with flank pain and tenderness, and all with reflux underwent dimercapto-succinic acid (DMSA) scan at least 4 months after presenting with infection to assess established renal scars. New renal scars were identified when new renal defects were demonstrated on a second DMSA scan. In our data base there are 1,426 patients with urinary tract infections, 685 (46%) with pyelonephritis and 1,062 (74.5%) with vesicoureteral reflux, including 558 found to have bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and 504 diagnosed with unilateral reflux. A history of daytime urinary incontinence was noted in 538 patients (37.7%), 192 (13.5%) had established scars at initial presentation and in 31 (2.1%) new renal scars developed while they were under our care, including 30 with established scars as well. Of the 25 patients in whom new renal scars developed while on medical therapy 11 underwent surgery. In 6 patients with dysfunctional voiding who were receiving medical treatment renal scars developed postoperatively. Surgery was performed in 17 of the 31 patients and 24 (77%) with new renal scars had a history of dysfunctional voiding. Previous characterizations of patients with new renal scars have relied on excretory urography for assessing renal architecture and ignored voiding patterns of the children affected. Using the DMSA scan we identified 31 children with reflux, urinary tract infection and dysfunctional voiding in whom new renal scars developed while they were under our care."}

Results of MEDLINE searches were compared with a reference standard collection of studies on two subjects, the diagnostic value of ESR in discriminating between 'pathology' and 'no pathology', and the dipstick method in diagnosing urinary tract infections. The main outcome measures were sensitivity (proportion of the total number of reference standard diagnostic studies that could be identified by the search) and positive predictive value (proportion of the total number of publications retrieved by MEDLINE that were incorporated in the reference standard). The combined MeSH and freetext search was more sensitive than MeSH term searching only, for both the ESR and the dipstick search. With this combined search sensitivities of 0.91 and 0.98 and predictive values of 0.10 and 0.68 were found for ESR and dipstick respectively. By restricting the search with keywords describing the primary health care setting the predictive values increased to 0.72 and 1.00 but sensitivity dropped to 0.10 and 0.07 (ESR and dipstick respectively). Combining freetext and MeSH term searching, without restriction to the primary health care setting, is a valuable strategy in systematically searching for available evidence on the value of a diagnostic test in the scope of a specific disease. The predictive value seems to depend on the breadth of the disease area.

Our data indicate that SBP in cirrhotic patients led to a long-lasting increased local production of NO.

Qualitative and quantitative criteria for swelling were defined. Thirty-one observed kidneys satisfied the criteria of swelling. Quantitatively, kidney length and width/length were greater in swollen kidneys. Kidney uptake in percent of injected dose and kidney uptake/background were lower in swollen kidneys. Qualitatively, focal radioactive uptake defects known from a previous examination were sometimes obscured by swelling, and reappeared at follow-up. In 5 children with signs of swelling on repeat imaging, scintigraphy reinfection at the time of swelling was verified. Swollen kidneys may be the only sign of acute pyelonephritis on DMSA scintigraphy and swelling may obscure focal radioactive uptake defects.

When no R.N. was present, grade of reflux was < IV, and age < 12 years, a non surgical treatment was indicated. During first examination R.N. was demonstrated in 47% of kidneys; the main difference was the grade of reflux: 16/44 II-III (36%) and 14/20 IV-V (70%).

Ultrasonograms and renal cortical scintigrams of children with reflux were evaluated. All siblings were considered asymptomatic by the referring physicians. The overall incidence of vesicoureteral reflux was 36.5%, and the incidence in girls and boys was 39.3 and 32.1%, respectively. Children 24 months old or younger had the highest incidence (45.7%) and the highest risk of bilateral reflux. From ages 25 to 72 months the incidence of reflux was 33.1% and in siblings older than 72 months it was 7%. Reflux of urine to the level of the renal pelvis was detected in 28.6% of all referred siblings. Renal damage was observed on sonography or scintigraphy in 4.7% of the siblings with reflux. The high incidence of vesicoureteral reflux through age 72 months indicates that it is important to screen siblings of children with reflux at an early age to prevent renal damage, which can occur in the absence of symptomatic urinary tract infection."}

Laboratory tests, including tumour markers, were unremarkable. Diagnostic tests to exclude malignant tumour with metastases were negative (thyroid scintigraphy, mammography, coloscopy and gastroscopy). Further tests (ultrasound, coeliaco-mesentericography, hydro-CT and spiral CT, MRI) revealed a tumour, 5 x 4 x 4 cm, in segment I of the liver, most likely an adenoma. Surgical intervention was indicated by the size and questionable malignancy of the tumor. At operation a tumour was found which originated from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and displaced segment I of the liver. The tumour was resected and the venous wall reconstructed with a Goretex patch. Histological examination indicated a poorly differentiated leiomyosarcoma of the IVC. Adjuvant radiotherapy was undertaken postoperatively. There has been no evidence of recurrence after 10 months. Leiomyosarcoma of the IVC can be mistaken, both by ultrasound and tomographic diagnostic procedures, for a tumour in segment I of the liver, especially an adenoma.

Current recommendations for the universal investigation of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children by ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrography, and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (and sometimes intravenous pyelography as well) are not based on any convincing evidence as to the necessity or effectiveness of such a routine. Over 8% of all girls will have a UTI during childhood. About 87 individuals in a million will develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by the age of 60 years, caused in about 9% by pyelonephritis (PN) or reflux nephropathy. From these statistics, the maximal risk of a first diagnosed UTI progressing to ESRD is approximately 1:10,000. The risk of developing hypertension following a first UTI in childhood, without eventual evolution to ESRD, appears to be very small. The cost of the widely recommended routine imaging procedures ranges from U.S. $355 in Britain to U.S. $1,090 in the United States. The minimal cost of preventing a single progression to ESRD by early diagnosis of underlying pathology-if this were possible in all cases-would range between U.S. $5 million in Britain and U.S. $15 million in the United States. Since in many instances progressive renal damage can not be prevented, the true cost is considerably higher. Lower UTI in girls is a very common and, in most cases, benign finding in primary-care practice. It is suggested that girls with afebrile UTI, presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms alone, need not undergo any imaging procedures, but should be followed with urine examinations and cultures at the time of febrile illness. The recommended investigative routines should be reserved for UTI in infants and in girls with fever or other symptoms suggesting PN, and for proven recurrent UTI. Such a regimen will allow a marked saving in terms of costs and in terms of unnecessary radiation, psychological stress to children, and stress, inconvenience, and time loss to parents. There is no evidence that this approach will compromise the course or final outcome of this very common condition."}

This static imaging procedure is currently performed 3-5 hr after the injection of a cortical fixation agent, 99mTc-DMSA or 99mTc-GH, and requires effective immobilization of the patient for 30 min. In five healthy adult volunteers and five children with various clinical indications, SPECT renal parenchymal scintigraphy was performed with a three-detector camera in 1-min per revolution sequential intervals for a total acquisition time of 4 min, beginning immediately after an intravenous injection of a graduated dose of 20 mCi (minimum 2 mCi) of the dynamic renal agent 99mTc-MAG3. Tomograms of the renal parenchyma reconstructed in three projections and volume-rendered reprojection of the SPECT-volume data indicated normal or abnormal renal parenchyma. Comparisons were made with planar MAG3 and SPECT-GH and favored MAG3-SPECT. However, comparisons with DMSA indicated certain disadvantages of MAG3 SPECT. For most organs, the radiation dose estimates from 20 mCi MAG3 were lower than those from DMSA (6 mCi) or GH (20 mCi). Simultaneous injection of MAG3 and a diuretic (2-40 mg furosemide) resulted in lower than usually reported radiation dose estimates for the urinary bladder (target organ) and the gonads, and allowed subsequent evaluation of the drainage system. MAG3 SPECT is feasible, clinically useful and may be offered as a rapid (4 min) renal parenchymal imaging procedure, or it may precede planar dynamic (dluretic) MAG3 scintigraphy."}

Consequently, DMSA scintigraphy provides a unique opportunity to study the progression of renal damage and functional loss from the initial insult of acute pyelonephritis to the subsequent development of irreversible renal scarring. Over the last few years, clinical and experimental investigations using DMSA renal scintigraphy have provided new insights into the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical outcome of acute pyelonephritis in children. These studies have confirmed the primary role of the acute inflammatory response, associated with both reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis, in the etiology of irreversible renal scarring.

A second DMSA scan was performed in 48 children a mean of 7.5 months after the first. US abnormalities were found in 25 children (45 %). The first DMSA scan showed a parenchymal aspect suggestive of pyelonephritis in 51 patients (93 %). Among the 18 patients studied by CT, 14 had abnormalities. Normal US findings did not rule out renal parenchymal involvement. Scintigraphy appeared to be more sensitive than CT for renal involvement. The frequency and degree of initial renal parenchymal damage seemed to correlate with vesicoureteral reflux, but the most severe initial parenchymal defects were not associated with marked clinical or laboratory manifestations. Repeat DMSA scans, performed on 45 kidneys with abnormalities at the first examination, showed resolution in 19, improvement in 16, persistence in 8 and deterioration in 2. The prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux was not higher in patients with renal scarring on the second DMSA scan than in patients whose scans showed an improvement. DMSA scans should be considered as a reference in the detection and follow-up of renal scarring associated with acute urinary tract infection as this technique is more sensitive than US and CT, the latter being unsuitable because it entails radiation exposure and sedation of patients."}

In renal transplant recipients, where reflux can induce acute pyelonephritis, this technique has not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to assess the radioisotopic technique in these patients. Seventeen renal transplant recipients had developed acute pyelonephritis following the surgical grafting procedure. They were investigated using both MC techniques. Radioisotopic MC was performed using 99mTc-pertechnetate. Reflux was documented in nine patients by radioisotopic MC but in only seven with the conventional technique. All negative patients remained symptom free after the pyelonephritis was cured and it was assumed that they had no reflux. Consequently, using the radioisotopic MC as gold standard, the conventional X-ray technique had a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 100%.

We conducted a prospective study of 250 consecutive infants 28 days of age or less (range, 4 to 28 days) who had rectal temperatures of at least 38 degrees C. After a complete history, physical examination and sepsis workup, the 131 febrile neonates with clinical and laboratory findings indicating low risk for bacterial infections were hospitalized, closely observed and not given antibiotics. The low risk criteria used to identify these neonates included well appearance; absence of physical signs of an ear, eye or soft tissue infection; a white blood cell count of 5000 to 15,000/mm3, a neutrophil band form count of < 1500/mm3, a spun urine specimen that had < 10 white blood cells per high power field on microscopy and a C-reactive protein value of < 20 mg/l. The remaining 119 febrile neonates who did not meet the low risk criteria were hospitalized and given empiric antibiotics pending culture results. The overall incidence of bacterial infections in the 250 febrile neonates was 16.4% (41 neonates) with bacteremia and/or meningitis occurring in 4.4% (11 neonates). Of the 131 low risk neonates only one (0.8%) had a bacterial infection (urinary tract infection) compared with 40 (33.6%) among the 119 who did not meet the criteria (P < 0.05). The negative predictive value of these criteria for excluding bacterial infections was 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 97.7% to 100%). For bacteremia and meningitis this figure became 100%. However, the positive predictive value and specificity of the criteria were too low to identify all febrile neonates with bacterial infections. Among the low risk group 58 (44.3%) were reclassified on the second or third hospital day, because of continued fever (35), poor activity (14) and white blood cell count > 15000/mm3 on a repeat blood test (9). They were given antibiotics, but only 1 had a urinary tract infection. This patient was then treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics. All low risk neonates recovered uneventfully with no relapses observed during their hospital stay or at the time of minimum 1-week outpatient follow-up visits. By the low risk criteria a substantial number of febrile neonates at low risk for bacterial infections can be identified and managed safely as inpatients without antibiotic therapy."}

Several studies have highlighted the limitations of the standard urinalysis for identifying UTI in infants and young children and have recommended performance of both urinalysis and urine culture. Alternative methods such as dipstick urinalysis, although attractive because of ease of performance, are inadequate as a screen for UTI. Hemocytometer WBC counts of an uncentrifuged urine specimen can be performed in an office or hospital-based laboratory with minimal training. Performance of Gram-stained smears, however, is most appropriate for the hospital-based laboratory. In the hospital setting where both tests can readily be performed, the positive predictive value of the combination of pyuria and bacteriuria (85%) allows prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available, whereas the lower positive predictive value of the single finding of either pyuria or bacteriuria (40%) justifies delaying treatment decisions until culture results are available. In the office setting where hemocytometer counts can easily be performed, culturing only specimens with pyuria and those of children presumptively treated with antimicrobials will result in the identification of almost all patients with true UTI, sparing large health care expenditures. Although the urine culture is traditionally regarded as the gold standard of UTI, positive urine cultures may occur secondary to contamination or in cases of ABU, leading to a false diagnosis of UTI. In contrast we found pyuria to be a reliable marker to discriminate infection from colonization of the urinary tract. The sustained absence of an inflammatory response, on repeat UA within 24 h, constitutes strong evidence that infection is absent. Management of ABU is controversial; many experts recommend withholding antibiotics because eradication of low virulence organisms may be followed by colonization with more virulent species that cause pyelonephritis. Preliminary results of our ongoing treatment trial suggest that management of young febrile children with UTI as outpatients receiving oral cefixime is as efficacious as inpatient management with intravenous cefotaxime. Results of renal ultrasound and DMSA scan at the time of infection have not modified management in any patient. Accordingly selective rather than routine performance of ultrasound is recommended. A voiding cystourethrogram at 1 month and a DMSA scan 6 months later have been valuable in identifying patients with vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring, respectively. Among patients initially identified as having acute pyelonephritis, the incidence of renal scarring at 6 months has been substantially more frequent (approximately 40%) than we had expected. However, the long term implications of small scars identified with renal scintigraphy remain to be determined."}

The general belief about the relation between risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis and age is that infants are at highest risk and children older than 5 years at lower risk. This assumption has led to differences in treatment based on age. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the occurrence of renal lesions in children aged 0-16 years. Between May, 1994, and January, 1996, all children aged 0-16 years who were admitted to our department with a diagnosis of probable pyelonephritis and a positive urine culture were included in this prospective study. All patients received antibiotics for 7-21 days. During the acute phase of urinary-tract infection, scintigraphy with technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and ultrasonography were done. Voiding cystourethrography was undertaken at least 6 weeks after the end of antibiotic treatment. When scintigraphy showed renal parenchymal lesions, repeat scintigraphy was done after at least 2 months to assess the progression of renal lesions. For the analysis, children were grouped by age according to presumed risk of renal sequelae after pyelonephritis: high risk (< 1 year), moderate risk (1-5 years), low risk (> 5 years). 201 patients were enrolled in the study (119 < 1 year, 47 aged 1-5 years, 35 > 5 years). During the acute phase of urinary-tract infection, renal lesions were found in 66 (55%) infants under 1 year, in 37 (79%) children aged 1-5 years, and in 24 (69%) children older than 5 years. Of these 127 children, 108 underwent repeat scintigraphy after an average of 3 months (50 < 1 year, 36 aged 1-5 years, 22 > 5 years). Overall, renal scars were found on repeat scintigraphy in 20 (40%) infants under 1 year, in 31 (86%) children aged 1-5 years, and in 14 (64%) children older than 5 years. 38 (36%) of these 65 patients had vesicoureteric reflux. Among 88 children who had a first documented urinary-tract infection and underwent repeat scintigraphy, renal scars were found in 20 (43%) under 1 year, in 26 (84%) aged 1-5 years, and in eight (80%) older than 5 years. This study did not confirm the conventional view that the risk of renal scars after pyelonephritis diminishes with age. We believe that all children, irrespective of age, will benefit from any measure that prevents the development of renal sequelae."}

In some patients undergoing an U.S. study of kidney for lumbodynia, it's sometime possible to visualize hypoechoic and areas poorly demarcated without distal acoustic enhancement, localized within the cortex and disrupting the cortico-medullary junction. These findings, called focal nephritis, associated to minimal retention of urine in the bladder, reflect an inflammatory process involving the renal parenchyma, in spite of normal urine analysis. To confirm this theory, 7 patients who presented these findings at US study of kidney underwent renal scintigram with labeled granulocytes. This test revealed the presence of focal bacterial nephritis in the same hypoechoic areas. Therefore US study of kidney combined with renal scintigram is useful to diagnose inflammatory process of the kidney in patients complaining lumbodynia."}

The Authors have carried out a clinical trial of the prophylactic use of cefaclor in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in children. We studied 52 children (25 females and 27 males, median age 7 +/- 19 months) with UTI, investigated by imaging (sonography, micturating cystourethrography, renal scintigraphy) and by urodynamic studies. We found vesicoureteral reflux in 37 cases, primitive megaureter in 6 cases, in 1 patient duplication of the collecting system in 1 patient and substenosis of ureteropelvic junction in 1 case. In the others 5 cases the UTI were associated with bladder disfunction and finally in 1 case the UTI occurred in absence of urinary malformations. All patients received cefaclor, as prophylaxis, at the dosage of 10-20 mg/kg/die, administrated as a single bedtime dose. The mean time of treatment with cefaclor was 8 +/- 3,48 months. We observed an optimal compliance in all patients, also in the first year of life. In only two out of 52 patients, during the prophylaxis, we found documented bacteriuria. We stopped treatment in two cases because of an adverse effect (in both children has been demonstrated a cutaneous rash). In conclusion our study shows that cefaclor is an effective, well tolerated and safe agent in the UTI prophylaxis, also in the first year of life, when it seems to offer an optime alternative to other agents."}

The medical records and direct radionuclide cystograms of 56 adults who underwent 75 studies at this institution over a 5 year period were reviewed. The study was performed at a major university teaching hospital. The major indications were for assessment of recurrent urinary tract infection and follow-up of known vesicoureteric reflux. Overall, reflux was demonstrated in 36% patients. It was most frequently mild or moderate in severity and detected during both the filling and voiding phases of the study. Patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction had a higher incidence of vesicoureteric reflux and significantly smaller functional bladder capacity than other referred patients. All studies were well tolerated, easily performed and without complication. Given the lower radiation exposure and higher sensitivity than voiding cystourethrography, we believe that radionuclide cystography can be recommended in the evaluation of vesicoureteric reflux in adults as well as children. In the group of adults whose genitourinary anatomy is already known from other investigations, radionuclide cystography may be particularly suited."}

Peripheral venous blood mixed with ehtylenediaminetetraacetic acid was analyzed with a Sysmex E-4000 analyzer. The underlying diseases were sepsis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and other inflammatory diseases. The mean duration of survival from the onset of DIC was 16.9 +/- 23.9 days. The distribution of red cell sizes before the onset of DIC did not differ significantly from that in patients without DIC, but fragmentation of erythrocytes on blood films was more common in the early stage of DIC (p < 0.01). Before the onset of DIC, the two groups did not differ significantly in the frequency of giant platelets on blood smears. At the onset of DIC, the platelet distribution width, the mean platelet volume, and the platelet-to-large-cell ratio were significantly higher than in patients without DIC. The concentration of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and those of other serum enzymes did not change significantly, but the serum creatinine concentration and the blood urea nitrogen level increased as the platelet-to-large-cell ratio increased. No significant relation was evident between the levels of serum C-reactive protein and creatinine, between the platelet-to-large-cell ratio and the mean volume of red blood cells, or between the platelet-to-large-cell ratio and the distribution of red cell sizes. These data suggest that studies of platelets are more useful in the diagnosis of DIC at early stages of impaired organ function than are other indicators of inflammation such as the level of C-reactive protein."}

In a prospective study conducted at a PHC clinic, 16 of 94 children (17%) from whom urine was collected by strict aseptic catheterization had bacteriuria (BU). Twelve of these had associated leucocyturia (> 5 WBC/HPF). The median age of those with BU was 9 months (range 1-30 months). BU rarely occurred in isolation (6%), but was most often detected in association with acute respiratory infection (43%) and acute diarrhoea (19%). No association of BU with mild malnutrition was detected in the 50% of children who were underweight for age. Gram-negative pathogens accounted for 14 cases (87.5%). These pathogens were resistant to commonly recommended antibiotics for UTI. Only five cases of BU returned for follow-up at 3 months; no abnormalities were detected on repeat catheter urine samples, urinary tract ultrasonography, voiding cystourethrogram and DMSA studies in them. From these and other findings we conclude that BU is probably often present in young children with common diseases attending PHC centres in developing countries. Further studies are required to establish exactly the role these pathogens play in the pathogenesis of UTI."}

The serum concentration of CRP was compared with the classic markers of inflammation--white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and temperature--in the follow-up of 85 patients undergoing 173 extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) treatments. Post-SWL, 69% of the patients showed dilation of the upper tract on ultrasonography and 16.5% became symptomatic and required intervention. In this group, the mean CRP value was increased 18-fold, whereas the WBC count, ESR, and temperature were not markedly raised.

A standard 99mTc-DMSA protocol was used to study 496 children (157 males, 339 females) aged from birth to 14 yr. Findings were classified according to the image appearance and relative function of each kidney. These were related to age, sex, history and timing of UTI and the results on micturating cysto-urethrography (MCU). Images were normal, with function within limits (45%-50% in one kidney), in approximately half the boys and girls studied. The other images were classified as equivocal in 68 children, abnormal unilaterally in 105 and bilaterally in 76, and they were subdivided according to the image appearance. No image changes could be identified that were specifically associated with acute UTI. Diffuse change alone was uncommon. A high proportion of abnormal images was found in infant boys, older girls with recurrent UTI and those children with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). Of the bilateral abnormal images, 98% were seen in children with VUR. Our findings suggest that infective renal change may be superimposed on underlying congenital lesions (perhaps detectable antenatally) or may be acquired following UTI in the presence of reflux and are thus potentially preventable. This study also suggests that VUR is almost certain to have occurred in a child who has bilateral abnormal 99mTc-DMSA images following UTI and is also commonly present in those with definite unilateral defects."}

The overall concordance between the planar and SPET imaging scores was 90.9, 89.9 and 87.7% for the three observers, respectively. Inter-observer discordance was recorded in a small percentage of both planar and SPET images. The number of lesions, based on the average of the three observers, was 22 for planar and 25 for SPET imaging. Obvious differences between observers were noted. The planar images were more often interpreted as equivocal by the least experienced observer. The more experienced observers gained limited additional information using SPET routinely. Most equivocal lesions on the planar scintigrams were observed in the lower segment. For SPET, no such distribution was noted. High-quality 99Tcm-DMSA images allow the detection of the same number of lesions as SPET in adults suspected of APN."}

Concentrations of sTNFR I, sTNFR II and IL-1ra were related to the expression of five virulence markers of E. coli, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and to the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum. Patients with acute pyelonephritis had elevated serum concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II compared to healthy women (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II in urine were significantly higher in patients with acute pyelonephritis compared to controls (P < 0.001 in both cases). The concentration of sTNFR II in urine was higher in patients infected by E. coli producing haemolysin (P = 0.05) and in patients infected by E. coli expressing hydrophobic properties (P = 0.05) compared to patients infected by strains without these virulence traits. Patients who had high concentrations of sTNFR II in serum during acute pyelonephritis had lower GFR at follow-up (r = -0.48, P = 0.05). Patients who responded with a marked increase in CRP had higher sTNFR I and sTNFR II in urine (r = 0.58, P < 0.01 and r = 0.48, P < 0.01, respectively). The concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II in serum and urine decreased during follow-up and were lower 2 weeks after the infection when all patients were free from bacteriuria. IL-1ra in serum was elevated during pyelonephritis (P < 0.001) while that in urine was significantly lower compared to controls (P < 0.001). It is concluded that the increased concentrations of TNF receptors may block the cytotoxic and inflammatory actions and reduce the sensibility of renal cells to TNF alpha-mediated effects."}

Urine and serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 responses were higher in children with febrile urinary tract infection (n = 61) than in those with asymptomatic bacteriuria (n = 39). By univariate analysis, cytokine levels were related to age, sex, reflux, renal scarring, urine leukocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and bacterial properties (P fimbriae but not hemolysin). Multivariate modeling showed that urine IL-6 responses were higher in girls than boys, increased with age, and were positively associated with CRP, ESR, serum IL-6, and urine leukocyte counts. The urine IL-8 response was not influenced by age, but it was influenced by P fimbriae and was associated with ESR, CRP, urine leukocytes, and female sex. The results show that cytokine responses to urinary tract infection vary with the severity of infection and that cytokine activation is influenced by a variety of host and bacterial variables."}

The 99mTc-DMSA scan is accepted as the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting areas of renal parenchymal scarring. More recently the DMSA scan has also been shown to be of value in imaging areas of renal parenchymal involvement in both children and adults with acute pyelonephritis. We assessed the acute DMSA scan findings in a consecutive series of 81 patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed if the patient had a fever of > 37.8 degrees C, loin pain or tenderness and infected urine (99% Escherichia coli). Patients had a blood culture taken (8 positive), as well as a hematological (leukocytosis 75%) and biochemical screen, C-reactive protein (CRP) (increased in 57 of 66 [86%]) and urinary tract ultrasonography. If the initial DMSA scan was abnormal it was repeated after three months and in some instances again at six months. If persisting defects were noted an intravenous urogram was then undertaken. Of the 81 patients, 37 (46%) had an abnormality on the DMSA scan. Nineteen had a single defect, 12 multifocal defects, five features suggestive of pre-existing renal parenchymal scarring (all later shown to have reflux nephropathy) and one a shrunken kidney. Those patients with an abnormal scan had a higher CRP concentration than those with a normal scan. Of the 31 patients who had either a focal or multifocal defect on their initial DMSA scan there was adequate follow-up on 24 patients. In 18 of these the defects had resolved by six months (usually within three months), while of the remainder, three were shown to have reflux nephropathy, one had a large single renal cyst and another an area of parenchymal calcification. Fifty-three of 76 patients (70%) had normal ultrasonography. In adults with acute pyelonephritis, the DMSA scan may prove to be the most useful renal imaging procedure."}

To determine whether the absence of pyuria on the enhanced urinalysis can be used to eliminate the diagnosis of urinary tract infection, avoiding the need for urine culture and sparing large health care expenditures. Results of an enhanced urinalysis (hemocytometer counts and interpretation of Gram-stained smears) performed on uncentrifuged urine specimens obtained by catheter were correlated with urine cultures in young febrile children at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Emergency Department. In a group of 4253 children (95% febrile) less than 2 years of age, pyuria was defined as > or = 10 white blood cells/mm3, bacteriuria as any bacteria on any of 10 oil immersion fields in a Gram-stained smear and a positive culture as > or = 50,000 colony-forming units/ml. A subgroup of 153 children with their first diagnosed urinary tract infection were enrolled in a separate treatment trial, acute phase reactants (peripheral white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) were obtained and 99Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans were performed. The presence of either pyuria or bacteriuria and the presence of both pyuria and bacteriuria have the highest sensitivity (95%) and positive predictive value (85%), respectively, for identifying positive urine cultures. Because a white blood cell count in a hemocytometer is the technically simpler component of the enhanced urinalysis, we chose to analyze the false negative results and achievable cost savings of using pyuria alone as the sole criterion for omitting urine cultures. If in this study urine cultures had been performed only on specimens from children who had pyuria or were managed presumptively with antibiotics, cultures of 2600 (61%) specimens would have been avoided. Twenty-two of 212 patients with positive urine cultures would not have been identified initially. However, based on interpretation of acute phase reactants, initial 99Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scan results, response to management and incidence of renal scarring 6 months later, 14 of the 22 patients most likely had asymptomatic bacteriuria and fever from another cause. The remaining 8 patients probably had early urinary tract infection. The analysis of urine samples obtained by catheter for the presence of significant pyuria (> or = 10 white blood cells/mm3) can be used to guide decisions regarding the need for urine culture in young febrile children."}

The purpose of this study was to directly compare the sensitivity and specificity of SPECT and pinhole imaging for the detection of acute pyelonephritis using histology as the standard of reference. Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux of infected urine was induced in 16 piglets (32 kidneys) by unroofing the intravesical ureter and subsequently instilling a broth culture of E. coli into the bladder. DMSA scans were obtained by both pinhole and SPECT techniques at 24 hr (4 piglets), 48 hr (5 piglets), 72 hr (4 piglets) and 10 days (3 piglets) after instillation of bacteria into the bladder. Kidneys were harvested immediately after scintigraphy for histopathologic examination. Results of the SPECT images, pinhole images and histologic findings were interpreted independently in a blinded fashion. The images of each kidney were classified as positive or negative for pyelonephritis regardless of the severity and number of lesions. To evaluate accuracy of SPECT and pinhole imaging for the detection of individual lesions, each kidney was arbitrarily divided into three zones (upper, middle and lower). Image findings were then compared with the pathology results for the presence or absence of pyelonephritis in each zone. Histopathology revealed pyelonephritis in 24 of 32 kidneys (58 of 96 zones). The sensitivity of the DMSA scan for detection of affected kidneys was 92% for SPECT and 83% for pinhole; overall accuracy was 88% for both. The sensitivity of SPECT for the detection of affected renal zones was slightly better than pinhole imaging (91% compared with 86%), but its specificity was lower (82% compared with 95%) resulting in a similar accuracy. Excluding four piglets where scans were obtained within 24 hr after instillation of bacteria into the bladder, the sensitivity of SPECT and pinhole for the detection of affected kidneys were 95% and 90%, respectively. Their overall accuracy were 96% and 92%. In this subgroup, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of SPECT for the detection of involved zones were 96%, 95% and 96%, respectively. The corresponding values for pinhole imaging were 90%, 95% and 92%, respectively. Although the sensitivity of SPECT for the detection of acute pyelonephritis is slightly better than pinhole DMSA scan, the overall accuracy of these two imaging techniques is essentially the same."}

Reflux nephropathy is known to be a major cause of renal failure in children. Vesico-ureteral reflux is usually diagnosed by voiding cysto-urethrography (VCG). However, it has been observed that conventional VCG is not always reliable for the diagnosis of ureteral reflux. In the case of a 5 year old girl with recurrent febrile urinary tract infection, VCG showed no ureteral reflux. Urodynamic study revealed a large bladder capacity and significant residual urine. Renal scintigram delineated a right renal scar. Simple ultrasound examination with videotape recording during voiding definitely demonstrated the presence of significant ureteral reflux when she voided, that is, there was marked dilatation of the right distal ureter and ballooning of the right renal pelvis on voiding, and quick refilling of the bladder concomitantly with the disappearance of the pelvic ballooning. Therefore, an ultrasound during voiding may be useful for diagnosing ureteral reflux in patients where a VCG does not reveal reflux."}

Urine samples were collected from 7 surgical patients. UTI level was measured by radioimmunoassay and corrected by urinary level of creatinine. UTI levels began to increase from the first postoperative day and reached the maximum level on the third postoperative day. The pattern of UTI correlated with that of serum CRP levels. Meanwhile, when patient was in inflammatory condition postoperatively, UTI increased further and its pattern correlated with that of serum CRP levels. These results suggest that UTI is an acute phase reactant and a sensitive marker indicating the degree of inflammatory condition after surgery."}

Prospective observational study. Thirty-two intubated patients on mechanical ventilation for > or = 3 days with fever (> or = 38.3 degrees C) and a new or progressive density on chest radiograph. Twenty patients (21 tests) had adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Diagnostic evaluation for fever included bronchoscopy with protected specimen brushing and (protected) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); computed tomography (CT) of sinuses; cultures of blood, urine, and central lines; and CT of the abdomen in high-risk patients. Uptake of 67Ga was reported as either focal or diffuse pulmonary uptake and extrapulmonary uptake. The combined causes of fever were pneumonia (9), fibroproliferation of late ARDS (7), abdominal process (4), sinusitis (4), urinary tract infection (3), and others (6). Causes of the pulmonary densities were pneumonia (9), ARDS (13), atelectasis (7), congestive heart failure (3), and empyema (1). Marked and diffuse pulmonary uptake was found only in patients with ARDS; however, it was not useful in discriminating those patients with pulmonary fibroproliferation as the sole cause of fever (p = 0.167) from those with infection. 67Ga scintigraphy was inadequate for detecting pneumonia but valuable in identifying extrapulmonary sites of infection in patients with ARDS (p = 0.021). 67Ga scintigraphy should be considered only as an adjunct diagnostic test in the febrile, ventilated patient who has no obvious source of fever, despite a negative evaluation that includes testing for pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection, conditions that are rarely detected by 67Ga scintigraphy."}

After randomization but before antibiotic treatment, urine specimens were analysed for pyuria by sediment microscopy and for nitrite using a test strip, and cultures were performed. The systemic inflammatory response was assessed by C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and total white blood cell count. The combined use of tests for pyuria and nitrite resulted in a high sensitivity (0.93) and efficacy (0.85) when the prevalence of bacteriuria was 0.89. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounted for 93% of the urinary isolates. Significantly more patients infected with S. saprophyticus than E. coli complained of dysuria (p < 0.05), frequency (p < 0.05) or flank pain (p < 0.01). CRP agreed best with the clinical diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis.

When imaging is requested in these cases, CT scan with and without contrast enhancement is preferable; however, depending on the condition of the patient and preference of the clinician an IVU, sonogram, or radionuclide scan may also provide adequate information. Patients at higher risk for complications, such as renal or perinephric abscesses with or without PHN and EPN, require aggressive and vigorous clinical and radiologic monitoring. CT scan is superior to other imaging modalities in the investigation of these complications. Interventional percutaneous procedures are established as safe and effective means of controlling or curing the infection in many patients and are often chosen over traditional surgical technique. The radiologist thus is an indispensable member of the management team and should be available for consultation and intervention."}

Twenty-seven children under 3 yr of age, with clinical and/or laboratory suspicion of APN, were investigated. All 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT and planar images and voiding cystoureterogram (VCUG) were obtained within 3 days of hospitalization. In the first examination, renal cortical defects were detected in 23 patients (42 kidneys) with SPECT and in 9 patients (11 kidneys) with planar scintigraphy. One year after treatment, constant renal cortical lesions were observed in 11 patients (14 kidneys) with SPECT and 4 patients (4 kidneys) with planar scintigraphy. The high grades of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) (grade >or= 3) correlate better with APN diagnosed by SPECT (34 kidneys) than by planar scintigraphy (8 kidneys). Multiple renal cortical defects (number of lesions >or= 4) were only seen in patients under 1.5 yr old and none of those with a negative 99mTc-DMSA renal SPECT had a positive 99mTc-DMSA renal planar scintigraphy at any time. There is a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the diagnostic ability of these two methods of examination.

This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques by drawing from the extensive literature currently available. The consensus view is that a DMSA scan is the most sensitive method of detecting renal scarring and of highlighting the kidney at risk of developing scarring. It is hoped that wider early use of DMSA scintigraphy will lead to a fall in the number of children who develop end-stage renal disease."}

The stone location was in the renal pelvis in 38 cases, in the upper renal calyx in 4 cases, in the lower calyx in 2, while 6 children had staghorn calculi. The stone size ranged between 3 and 39 mm. All treatments were performed with Dornier HM4 except 12 children, all older than 10 years, who underwent ESWL with Dornier HM3. All ESWL procedures took place under general anesthesia or sedation with ketamine. The number of shock waves varied between 400 and 2,000 per treatment and the standard maximum generator voltage was 18 kV. The overall stone clearance rate at 1 month was 66%. Fourteen children with large residual fragments underwent a second ESWL procedure 3 months later. With a mean follow-up of 33 months, 41 children (82%) are stone-free. Ten children developed urinary tract infection and 5 Steinstrasse. Twelve children had a pre- and post-ESWL DMSA scan and no permanent impairment of renal function was observed. We conclude that ESWL is the treatment of choice for urinary tract lithiasis in childhood. It is a low-risk method, without serious complications, which yields as high a success rate in children as in adults. We believe that as the stone fragmentation and clearance is much higher in children that in adults, the method must be the initial approach and may be the monotherapy even in staghorn or complex stones."}

Urinary concentrations of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra) standardized to urinary creatinine concentrations were studied. The median standardized IL-1 alpha creatinine quotient in children with first-time acute pyelonephritis was 3.6 pg/mumol, but was nondetectable in children with recurrent pyelonephritis, children with non-renal febrile conditions and children convalescent after acute pyelonephritis (p < 0.05-0.01). IL-lra levels were also significantly higher in children with acute first-time pyelonephritis (median of 239 pg/mumol) compared to these three groups of children (p < 0.01-0.001). The highest urinary IL-lra levels, however, were found in the healthy controls (median value 1.019; p < 0.001). Both cytokines were higher among children younger than one year compared to older children. The acute IL-1 alpha creatinine quotients were lowest in children with uptake defects on 99mTC-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy both during the acute infection (reflecting the acute inflammation) (p < 0.001) and 1 year after the acute infection (reflecting permanent kidney scarring) (p < 0.001). In conclusion, persisting high urinary levels of IL-1 alpha were associated with less renal inflammation and scarring."}

Focal areas of decreased perfusion may be shown by power Doppler sonography in children with acute pyelonephritis. The purposes of this study were to assess the ability of power Doppler sonography to reveal acute pyelonephritis and to compare the sonographic images with enhanced CT images. We performed B-mode sonography, power Doppler sonography, and enhanced CT (reference method) of the kidneys of 30 children with symptoms suggesting upper urinary tract infection. All imaging studies were obtained within 24 hr of admission of each child to our hospital. Power Doppler sonography was performed with the same equipment and the same settings for all children. Imaging studies were performed before the results of urine cultures were obtained. Triangular areas of decreased perfusion visible on both longitudinal and axial scans were considered indicative of acute pyelonephritis on power Doppler sonographic images. On CT images, areas of decreased attenuation of the renal parenchyma visible immediately after IV injection of iodinated contrast agent or areas of increased attenuation on delayed scans were considered indicative of acute pyelonephritis. Power Doppler sonography and CT were compared for each renal pole (n = 120). For 17 (89%) of the 19 patients with CT-proven acute pyelonephritis, power Doppler sonography diagnosed this condition on the correct side. Seventeen (77%) of the 22 poles showing acute pyelonephritis on CT scans were also revealed by power Doppler sonography. The two patients in whom acute pyelonephritis was not revealed by power Doppler sonography were an obese 15-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy with right upper pole pyelonephritis. This boy was one of the first patients to be included in the study. Also, in an obese 11-year-old girl, a false-positive indication of pyelonephritis was given by power Doppler sonography. Power Doppler sonography seems to be significantly more sensitive than conventional sonography for the detection of acute pyelonephritis in children. This noninvasive technique should be able to replace CT or dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy in many children with urinary tract infections."}

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was increased (48 mm/h) and C-reactive protein elevated to 42 mg/l. There was mild leucocytosis (10000/microliter). Abdominal sonography revealed an enlarged left renal pelvis with hydroureter and possible prevesical stone, findings confirmed at excretion urography. He was discharged with the suspected diagnosis of ureteric stone and given co-trimoxazole, diclofenac and hyoscine butylbromide. After discontinuing medication the same symptoms developed two weeks later. Cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography were unremarkable and it was assumed the stone had been passed. The patient was again discharged on the above medication. When it was discontinued the same symptoms recurred and he was again admitted. Computed tomography, selective small-intestine radiology, coloscopy and biopsy indicated Crohn's disease with hydronephrosis as complication. Treatment trial with prednisone and mesalazine brought about only transient improvement so that an ileocaecal resection and ureterolysis were performed. The patient has since been free of symptoms.

Common causes of acute scrotal pain include testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis and trauma. Epididymitis in adult men is typically associated with a history of urinary tract infection or prostatitis. Testicular torsion typically presents in young adults with a sudden onset of severe scrotal pain and, frequently, a history of recurrent episodes that have spontaneously resolved. With scrotal trauma, ultrasound may demonstrate testicular fracture, hematoceles and areas of hemorrhage or testicular infarction. Since both epididymitis and testicular torsion present with scrotal pain and swelling, and may be accompanied by fever and pyuria, Doppler ultrasound or radionuclide imaging may be necessary to make the diagnosis. In acute testicular torsion, color Doppler ultrasound shows absent flow to the epididymis and testis, while nuclear imaging shows central photon-deficient areas in the ischemic hemiscrotum. In epididymo-orchitis, color Doppler ultrasound shows increased flow to the epididymis and testis, while nuclear imaging shows increased perfusion of the affected testis and hemiscrotum."}

Staging voiding cystourethrography and DMSA scintigraphy were performed in 105 children with a urinary tract infection and reflux persistence was assessed by radionuclide cystography after a 2-year followup. Staging voiding cystourethrography revealed no reflux in 51 children (DMSA positive in 3), grades I to II reflux in 21 (DMSA positive in 6) and grade III reflux in 33 (DMSA positive in 19). On followup radionuclide cystography no new reflux was detected, and it was no longer demonstrated in 23 children (8 with grade III and 15 with grades I to II reflux). The finding of grade III reflux on staging voiding cystourethrography had a 76% positive and a 92% negative value for predicting persistent reflux with an 87% predictive accuracy. Limiting the evaluation of voiding cystourethrography data to the 28 children with a positive DMSA scan the combination of renal scarring and grade III reflux had an 84% positive and an 83% negative predictive value with 83% accuracy. This approach would have prevented 77 children from having to undergo voiding cystourethrography. Performance of staging voiding cystourethrography exclusively in children with renal scarring on a DMSA scan resulted in predictive accuracy that was close to what was achieved by performing voiding cystourethrography in all children with a urinary tract infection. To be able to limit cystourethrography to a select population could prove to be cost-effective."}

Planar scans were performed 3 h after the injection of 80 MBq of 99Tcm-DMSA and a 64 x 20 s acquisition over 360 degrees was used for SPET. High-resolution collimation was used for both. Slices were displayed as transaxial, coronal and sagittal and/or oblique sagittal in the plane of the kidney. Three-dimensional (3D) images were formed by volume rendering. Each kidney was divided into three regions and each region scored separately for the presence of an abnormality. Planar scans were reviewed alone and then in conjunction with SPET and 3D images. Planar imaging detected 95 abnormal regions compared with 103 using SPET. SPET reduced the number of equivocal regions in 8 (12%) patients. The diagnosis was altered by SPET in 17 (4%) regions in 14 (21%) patients.

Blood culture isolates included Escherichia coli (25), Staphylococcus aureus (4), enterococcus (1), group B Streptococcus (2), and Enterobacter (1). Besides one patient with group B Streptococcus bacteremia at 1.5 months of age, all bacteremias after one month of age were with E. coli.

The dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan is a method for assessing kidney function. Indications for DMSA scanning in children with urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as timing, have changed. Pitfalls in interpreting DMSA scans include: (1) acute pyelonephritis (APN), (2) tubular dysfunction, (3) hypertension, (4) use of captopril in patients with renovascular hypertension and (5) duplex kidneys. Interpretation of DMSA scans in children with UTI vary according to timing and clinical setting. During the course of a febrile UTI a DMSA scan may reveal a normal kidney, APN or a non-functioning, small and/or ectopic kidney. In the absence of UTI (up to 6 months) in children with vesicoureteric reflux a DMSA scan may indicate a normal kidney, renal scarring (reflux nephropathy), occult duplex kidney and allows the progression of scarring and hypertrophy of normal areas of the kidney to be followed anatomically. The DMSA renal scan in now the most reliable test for the diagnosis of APN. The transient abnormalities due to APN can occur in normal or scarred kidneys. Lesions due to reflux nephropathy (defined as a defect in the renal outline or contraction of the whole kidney) are permanent. Intravenous urography reveals renal abnormalities later than the DMSA scan. If abnormalities are seen on a DMSA scan performed during the course of APN it is impossible to predict the outcome: they can progress to permanent scarring or heal completely. An abnormal DMSA scan during a febrile UTI allows the identification of children at risk of developing renal scars. These children should be carefully investigated, maintained on long-term quimioprophylaxis and followed."}

Intravenous urography (IVU) still provides the most comprehensive structural assessment of the urinary tract. In particular, the radiological renal appearances approximate closely to the morphology of the renal scarring of reflux nephropathy or chronic atrophic pyelonephritis. It also provides reproducible renal measurements for follow-up assessment of renal growth and scarring. It is now less often used for first-line investigation of the acute urinary tract infection (UTI) because the swelling accompanying acute renal involvement is less easily recognised than the areas of defective function demonstrated on 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) studies. Also IVU contributes a higher radiation dose when calculated for full IVU (dependent on the number of films exposed) and there is a slight risk of side effects from injected contrast media, reduced by using non-ionic compounds. Because of its value in confirming such a serious diagnosis as renal scarring, suspected on ultrasonography or DMSA scintigraphy, modification of the technique of IVU with adequate preparation and the use of a reduced number of films, or single films localised to the renal areas, should be considered. Expertise in the interpretation of IVU must also be maintained because of the ancillary information regarding bowel and bladder function, the spine and evidence of stones, pertinent to the management of children with UTI and renal scarring.

In the past few years, the increasing use of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scans, urodynamic testing, and antenatal sonography have helped shed light on the interrelationship of these disorders. Renal parenchymal involvement during acute febrile UTI and subsequent renal scarring are quite commonly observed in the absence of VUR, suggesting that the presence of reflux is not a prerequisite for renal damage. In infants with gross VUR, renal damage is often present at birth even before the development of any UTI. High intravesical pressures during bladder filling and voiding are commonly observed in infants with gross VUR, reflecting an underlying voiding dysfunction. High voiding detrusor pressures are also commonly observed in infants presenting with symptomatic UTI who do not have VUR. Children with dysfunctional voiding states are at risk for development of VUR and UTI. Renal damage in these children may occur in the absence of one or the other. This review elucidates how voiding dysfunction predisposes children to bacterial colonization of the bladder, the development or perpetuation of VUR, and renal damage."}

The initial 99mTc-DMSA studies carried out over a four year period in 229 patients with various heterogenic causes of lower urinary tract abnormalities were reviewed. Anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma was graded by means of planar and SPECT studies into a six group classification proposed by Monsour et al.: grade 0 (normal), I (equivocal), II (single defect), III (more than 2 defects), IV (contracted or small) and V (no visualization). Parenchymal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA was quantitated from planar images at 2 hours postinjection by a computer assisted gamma camera method. SPECT studies could enhance the pick-up rate for parenchymal uptake defects by a factor of 1.5 in comparison with planar imaging. The incidence of anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma increased with a high radiological grade for VUR, and renal uptake per injection dose of 99mTc-DMSA by the individual kidney significantly decreased in grades III and IV of the anatomical classification. These data revealed that 99mTc-DMSA planar is still useful for evaluating gross structural damage and for quantitative evaluation of the kidney with computer assistance. SPECT scintigraphy is more effective in disclosing anatomical damage to the renal parenchyma than planar, although it needs further discussion as to whether SPECT may increase sensitivity with minimal or no adverse affect on specificity."}

Proteinuria and renal insufficiency were significantly more frequent in those with severe bilateral reflux nephropathy. All patients with reflux nephropathy who have proteinuria, hypertension or renal insufficiency should be under regular follow up."}

The reduced nephrogram or renal swelling following a first attack of acute pyelonephritis may not be recognised without renal measurement on an intravenous urogram.

All four investigations were normal in 12 children. In 36 with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) on MCU, dilatation was reported on ultrasonography in eight children. Radiological renal scarring was seen in 20 children; it was suspected on ultrasonography in nine, with dilatation alone in four, and a normal report in seven. Duplex kidneys identified on IVU were unrecognised on ultrasonography or DMSA studies; ultrasonography showed no change corresponding to presumed acute defects on DMSA studies that later resolved. Disparities were observed at all ages. This study suggests that ultrasonography is unreliable in detecting VUR, renal scarring, or inflammatory change and, alone, is inadequate for investigating UTI in children."}

At birth, if abnormalities are confirmed by ultrasound scan other instrumental investigation are needed: cystography, to exclude vesicoureteric reflux, and sequential scintigraphy, to evaluate if obstruction of urinary tract is present or to confirm the suspect of renal agenesis or multicystic dysplasia. Urography could be necessary in some cases. For bilateral uropathy evaluation of renal function with blood tests is required. Early surgery is needed in case of severe obstructive uropathy; if obstruction is mild the patients can be followed with instrumental investigation. Antibiotic prophylaxis is required to prevent urinary tract infections in patients with vesicoureteric reflux. The indications for surgery in patients with vesico-ureteric reflux are still unclear."}

Ultrasonography voiding cystography and renal scintiscan were performed in all cases and i.v. urography in some. A salt-losing syndrome with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia (Na < 125 meq/liter; K > 6.3 meq/liter) was observed in 17 infants < 3 months, accompanied by plasma aldosterone concentration of 5000 to 23,000 pg/ml (normal value, < 1000 pg/ml). All these children had a severe urinary tract (UT) malformation (ureteropelvic junction stenosis in 7 cases, vesicoureteral reflux in 7, posterior urethral valves in 2, double system in 1). Thirteen infants < 3 months, 7 with no urinary tract malformations, did not have electrolyte imbalance. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 20 other patients ages 4 to 15 months, including 16 with severe UT malformations; 4 had normal UTs. We conclude that a salt-losing syndrome with tubular resistance to aldosterone can occur during pyelonephritis in young infants with congenital UT malformation, that the risk diminishes considerably or disappears after 3 months of age and that in the absence of UT malformation pyelonephritis does not cause acute sodium loss of clinical relevance."}

The diagnosis of an urinary tract infection (UTI) is proved by the identification of a significant leucocyturia and bacteriuria of the mid-stream urine analysis in men and catheter urine in women. A diagnostical localisation is possible by the case history as well as clinical, sonographical and laboratory tests (leucocytes, CRP) to classify into a cystitis and infection of the parenchyma, respectively an uncomplicated or complicated UTI. Untreated complicated urinary tract infections have a bad prognosis. The therapy consists of bed rest, normalization of the urinary flow, a specific antibiotic therapy corresponding to the antibiotic sensitivity pattern and the administration of a prostaglandin-synthesis-inhibitor. Every physician should choose one of the many antibiotics and must get acquainted with the pharmacokinetics and side-effects. In severe acute infections, a calculated antibiotic therapy in certain combinations is necessary until the bacteriological findings are known. Corresponding to the spectrum of bacteria in complicated UTI, one should select a fluoro-chinolone, a broad-spectrum penicilline in combination with a beta-lactamase-inhibitor, a cephalosporine of the second and third generation with a relative stability against beta-lactamase as well as an aminoglycoside. Reserve-antibiotics for special indications are for example, cefsulodine. Less effective than the drugs mentioned above is cotrimoxazole, which was favourized before. In complicated UTI, the older gyrase-inhibitors like nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, cinoxacin and nitrofurantoin are not longer indicated. There is only one indication for the application of doxycyclin: the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. A lower dosage of antibiotics and a drug therapy of 7-10 days are sufficient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Although planar cortical scintigraphy has been demonstrated to be a sensitive test for the detection of renal infection and scarring, one criticism has been radiation dose to the renal cortex. Recent studies of cortical SPECT suggest a sensitivity for detection of lesions equal to, or greater than, that of planar scans. The authors prospectively performed SPECT scans on 36 patients referred for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) (11 of 36), or recent onset of symptoms of UTI (25/36) after 30-40% of the standard 130 MBq (3.5 mCi) adult dose of Tc-99m DMSA was administered. Comparison was made with ultrasonography (US) performed at, or near, the same time. Of 67 kidneys evaluated, 34 (51%) demonstrated focal cortical loss on Tc-99m DMSA scintigraphy, 1 kidney was small in size, and 32 kidneys were normal. Abnormalities were noticed in only 13 (19%) of kidneys on US. Previously, US has been the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of the young patient with UTI. Triple-headed Tc-99m DMSA SPECT scintigraphy is a more sensitive, low-dose (12 mGy, 1.2 r) method of detecting renal cortical abnormalities. As such, it is a more appropriate test for identifying sites of cortical infection and scarring and for following patients on prophylactic therapy for evidence of asymptomatic break-through infections."}

In order to evaluate the utilities of Tc-99m DMSA renal scan and the clinical meaning of cortical defects in the Tc-99m DMSA renal scan of the patients with acute pyelonephritis, ninety two patients with acute pyelonephritis, from March 1991 to February 1994 in Chungnam National University Hospital(CNUH), were included in this study. Patients were subdivided as Group A:Patients showing normal Tc-99m DMSA renal scan (n = 42) and Group B:Patients with definite cortical defects on the Tc-99m DMSA renal scan (n = 50). We compared clinical characteristics such as age and sex, recurrency, duration of fever, bacterial culture study, incidence of renal insufficiency and the results of renal ultrasonography and intravenous pyelography between the two groups. Fifty four percents of 92 patients with acute pyelonephritis showed a significantly longer febrile period after admission, higher positive rates on the urine and blood culture studies and higher incidence of renal insufficiency than those of the Group A patients. Sixty nine percents of Group B patients showed normal results in ultrasonography or IVP study. Tc-99m DMSA renal scan was a more sensitive imaging test than ultrasonography in kidneys and IVP to detect pyelonephritis lesions and may be useful to predict the patient group with a severe disease course. These patients may need more careful management and further studies to evaluate the possibility of complications."}

Long term follow up of children with urinary tract infections, in whom imaging investigations were performed at presentation, has been used to identify features that distinguish those at greatest risk of progressive renal damage. No single investigation at presentation was able to predict subsequent deterioration but, by employing a combination of imaging investigations, it was possible to separate groups with high or low probability of progressive damage. In the low risk group the incidence of progressive damage was 0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0 to 1.3%). The combination of both scarring and reflux at presentation, or one only of these but accompanied by subsequent documented urinary tract infection, was associated with a 17-fold (95% CI 2.5 to 118) increase in the relative risk of progressive renal damage compared with children without these features. The recommended combination of investigations at presentation for girls of any age and boys over 1 year is ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy in all, to detect both scarring and significant structural abnormalities, renography in children with dilatation of any part of the urinary tract on ultrasound, to distinguish dilatation from obstruction, and an isotope voiding study in all who have acquired bladder control. This gives the best separation between those at high and those at low risk of progressive damage with least radiation dose and lowest rate of instrumentation. Micturating cystourethrography (MCU) should be restricted to girls who have not acquired bladder control, unless there is reason to suspect a significant structural abnormality such as urethral valves. A single non-febrile urinary tract infection that responds promptly to treatment is not a justification for performing MCU in boys under 1 year or in children of any age with bladder control. No case can be made for any abbreviated schedule of investigation. These risk factors should be taken into account when designing follow up protocols."}

Reflux was not demonstrated either at presentation or at any subsequent time in almost one half of the children who suffered progressive renal damage and was not a risk factor for progressive renal damage in boys under 1 year. It was an important risk factor in boys over 1 year and in girls of any age. The risk of progressive renal damage in children in whom micturating cystourethrography (MCU) did not reveal vesicoureteric reflux was substantially greater than in those who indirect isotope voiding study (IVS) did not show reflux. The risk of deterioration for those in whom reflux was demonstrated was similar for both techniques. This discrepancy indicates an appreciably higher false negative rate for the MCU than the IVS. Dilatation of the renal pelvis detected by ultrasound was associated with a significantly increased risk of progressive damage only when associated with reflux, but most children with progressive damage did not have a dilated collecting system at presentation."}

Failure of a kidney to grow satisfactorily in childhood is evidence of renal disease. Because kidneys may enlarge during an episode of acute pyelonephritis, concomitant renal length measurements cannot be used as baselines for growth assessment. This study was designed to determine the degree of renal enlargement in children with acute pyelonephritis and the time the enlargement takes to resolve after treatment is started to find the optimum time for obtaining baseline measurements. In a cohort study, 180 children younger than 5 years old with their first proven acute urinary tract infection, with or without pyelonephritis, had renal scintigraphy and sonography within 15 days of starting treatment. The presence of cortical defects on scintigrams indicated pyelonephritis. The lengths of kidneys with and without scintigraphic defects (i.e., with and without pyelonephritis) were compared, adjusting for age and sex, and the length of kidneys with defects was related to time elapsed between the start of treatment and sonography. Ninety-nine kidneys (28%) in 77 children (43%) had scintigraphic defects. Kidneys with defects were an average of 3.2 mm longer than kidneys without defects. Length and time interval between treatment and sonography in kidneys with defects correlated negatively, with mean length approaching that of kidneys without defects by 10-11 days. Kidneys with acute pyelonephritis initially increase in length but return to normal on average by the 11th day of treatment. If poor renal growth is used as an indication of renal disease, sonography should be delayed or repeated at least 2 weeks after the start of treatment to determine the length of the uninflamed kidney."}

The kidneys of these younger patients also had a greater severity and prevalence of vesicoureteral reflux (74/290, 26%) than did those of older children (18/96, 19%). Early cortical defects are associated with an age less than 2 years and vesicoureteral reflux. However, the association of early defects with the presence and grade of vesicoureteral reflux is confounded by the declining prevalence and severity of reflux with age. A significant proportion of cortical defects occur in the absence of vesicoureteral reflux, and the contribution of reflux to scar formation might be less than previously considered."}

To assess the course of vesicoureteral reflux, we performed cystography, renal scintigraphy, and urography in all neonates with the prenatal diagnosis of renal pelvic dilation and revealed the presence of primary reflux (grades I to V) in 27 cases. Higher grades of reflux were associated with congenital renal damage, as shown by reduced tracer uptake during scintigraphy. Reflux was diagnosed more frequently in male infants (male/female ratio, 6:1), in many of whom bladder abnormalities were found by cystography. In another group of seven infants, in whom the reflux was associated with other urologic abnormalities, there was no sex prevalence. We conclude that severe primary reflux associated with hydronephrosis usually affects male infants and may be due to abnormal embryologic development of the male urethra, and that the kidney damage is primary and not the result of urinary tract infections. This pattern differs from that of vesicoureteric reflux diagnosed at an older age, which is observed most commonly in female patients."}

The samples were analyzed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and specific antibody activity to antigens extracted from the Escherichia coli strain infecting each patient. The host response to infection was further quantitated as fever, C-reactive protein, and renal concentrating capacity. Acute pyelonephritis in non-pregnant and pregnant women was accompanied by a significant serum and urine antibody response. The serum antibody response was significantly lower in the pregnant group. The IL-6 levels in serum and urine at diagnosis were significantly higher in the non-pregnant compared to the pregnant women. These results demonstrate that the immunosuppression of pregnancy includes the mucosal IL-6 and specific antibody responses to acute pyelonephritis caused by E. coli."}

The findings in these five patients were consistent with colonization of the urinary tract rather than infection. For urine specimens obtained by catheter, we believe that urinary tract infection is best defined by both a leukocyte count > or 10/mm3 and a CFU count > or = 50,000/ml. This definition almost always discriminates among true urinary tract infection, bacteriuria resulting from contamination of the urine specimen, and asymptomatic bacteriuria."}

Seventy six children, 18 boys and 58 girls, aged 0-15.9 (median 1.0) years, with acute pyelonephritis were prospectively studied with a technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan during infection and two months later. Fifty nine of these children were also studied two years after the infection. Seventeen children with a normal DMSA scan during infection or at two months after infection, or both, were not investigated by a DMSA scan at two years after acute pyelonephritis. A micturition cystourethrogram was performed in all the children after two months. Changes on the DMSA scan were found in 65 (86%) children during acute pyelonephritis, in 45 (59%) children at two months, and in 28 (37%) children at two years after infection. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) was found in 19 (25%) children at two months. Renal scarring was significantly correlated with the presence of gross VUR and recurrent pyelonephritis, but 62% of the scarred kidneys were drained by non-refluxing ureters. Children with scars were older at the time of acute pyelonephritis than those without scars but no difference was found between the groups with regard to duration of illness, levels of C reactive protein and maximum white cell count, glomerular filtration rate, nor renal concentration capacity at the time of infection. It is concluded that renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis in children is more common than has been previously thought. Although children with gross VUR and recurrent pyelonephritis are at the greatest risk, renal scarring is more often seen without these risk factors."}

The clearance was calculated by means of either the simplified second exponential method or the 120-min single blood sample; Chantler's correction was used in order to correct for having neglected the first exponential. There was a progressive increase in clearance from the first weeks of life (mean value around 1 month: 55 ml/min/1.73 m2), with a plateau at around 18 months. Between 2 and 17 years of age, the clearance values remained constant, with a mean value of 114 ml/min/1.73 m2 (SD: 24 ml/min); this is similar to the level described for inulin clearance. No significant differences were observed between boys and girls, or between clearance values calculated with one or with two blood samples.

DMSA renal scintigraphies in 101 children (152 renal units) with vesicoureteric reflux grade 1-5 were reviewed. Three main types of pathological DMSA patterns were found: (i) dysplasia; (ii) medial defect; and (iii) pole defects. In children with no history of pyelonephritis a normal distribution pattern was found in 31%, dysplasia in 23%, medial defect in 25%, pole defects in 17% and no typical pattern in 4%. In those with a history of pyelonephritis a normal distribution pattern was found in 28%, dysplasia in 24%, medial defect in 21%, pole defects in 24% and no typical pattern in 3%. A normal pattern was significantly more frequent in kidneys with reflux grade 1-2. Dysplasia was significantly more frequent in kidneys with reflux grade 4-5. In children with no history of pyelonephritis 42% of the renal units had reduced length, 8% with no other sign of pathology. The frequency of reduced kidney length at reflux grade 1-2 did not differ significantly from that at higher grades of reflux. In children with a history of pyelonephritis 52% of the renal units had reduced length, 13% with no other sign of pathology. The frequency of reduced kidney length with a normal DMSA pattern did not differ significantly from that with a pathological pattern. The pathological DMSA distribution with vesicoureteric reflux generally conforms to one of three main patterns. Reduced kidney length is frequent even at lower grades of vesicoureteric reflux even in patients with no history of pyelonephritis, and can be the only sign of pathology."}

The relationship of urinary tract infection and vesicoureteric reflux with the potential for renal scarring and serious sequelae is well known. Evaluation of the child with urinary tract infection and identification of those at risk for infection are of paramount importance. With early diagnosis and early institution of proper therapy, the likelihood of renal scarring can be significantly reduced, and thus outcome can be improved. This review points to the controversies surrounding the ability to accurately distinguish between upper and lower tract urinary infection, and whether this distinction is important in the care of the child with urinary infection. Vesicoureteric reflux as a risk factor is discussed. Ultrasound examination and voiding cystourethrogram or radionuclide cystogram are generally recommended for evaluating the lower urinary tract of infants and preschool children who have urinary tract infection. The role of dimercaptosuccinic acid scanning in evaluating the upper tract is debated."}

Cystourethrography demonstrated grades I and II reflux in 75 renal units and grades III to V in 40. Of the patients 51 presented with febrile urinary tract infection and 24 were asymptomatic (patients presenting with nonfebrile urinary tract infections or those undergoing sibling screening). Renal ultrasounds were performed in 60 patients. All patients were initially managed with medical therapy and 19 (25%) ultimately underwent antireflux surgery. DMSA scans demonstrated scarring in 17 of 40 renal units (43%) of patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and 6 of 75 renal units (8%) of those with low grade reflux. Renal ultrasounds that were interpreted as normal always correlated to a normal DMSA scan in asymptomatic patients. In patients presenting with febrile urinary tract infections the correlation between ultrasound and DMSA scan was inconsistent. We advocate a tailored approach in the evaluation of patients with vesicoureteral reflux. Renal sonography may be sufficient in the assessment of renal scarring in asymptomatic patients with reflux and those with low grade reflux. Conversely, in patients with high grade vesicoureteral reflux, a history of febrile urinary tract infections and abnormal renal ultrasound DMSA renal scans appear to be most useful."}

A total of 193 children had undergone both US and DMSA scintigraphy as part of an investigation of proven single or multiple urinary tract infections over a 27 month period. DMSA scintigraphy revealed abnormalities in 22 of the children (11%). The abnormalities ranged from cortical defects to congenital anatomical abnormalities. US revealed abnormalities in six children (3%) but did not contribute any additional information in any. In our institution, the DMSA scintigram alone would have been an adequate screening test for children with UTI. Hydronephrosis is a common abnormality detected by US. Although none were seen in the study group, several children were examined during the study period with dilated collecting systems detected at ante-natal US. No cases of hydronephrosis presented as UTI. We question whether the use of routine US is justifiable in the investigation of children with UTI, and discuss whether a more selective investigation protocol should be adopted."}

DMSA-SPECT showed normal findings in 2, single renal cortical detect (RCD) in 9 and multiple RCD in 16 (including nonvisualization in 2). Of the 11 kidneys with normal findings or single RCD on DMSA-SPECT, only 1 (9%) showed vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) on VCU (grade I). A large proportion of those with multiple RCDs showed abnormal findings on IVP (44%, 7/16), US (38%, 6/16) or VCU (31%, 5/16); 63% in any of these three studies. 5 of 6 patients with VUR had multiple RCDs on DMSA-SPECT, and 3 of these 5 showed no abnormality on IVP or US. 7 patients who needed other managements besides initial standard antibiotic treatment had multiple RCDs on DMSA-SPECT. 15 normal women were also studied and showed normal DMSA-SPECT, US and IVP, in all cases.

Patients infected with E. coli producing hemolysin and/or cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) had significantly higher IL-6 levels in serum during acute pyelonephritis as compared to patients infected with strains without the ability to produce these factors (p = 0.0025 and p = 0.0154, respectively). Patients who had high concentrations of IL-8 in urine during acute pyelonephritis had lower GFR at follow-up as compared to patients with lower levels of IL-8 in urine (r = -0.48, p = 0.0123). In conclusion, acute pyelonephritis is accompanied by elevated urinary and serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Bacteria producing hemolysin and CNF seem to induce higher concentrations of IL-6 in serum. The secretion of IL-8 from renal cells may participate in the initiation and maintenance of renal inflammation which in turn may influence renal function."}

The relationship between urine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8)/creatinine quotients and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, performed within 10 days of acute first-time pyelonephritis and after 1 year, was studied in 41 children. The urine IL-6 and IL-8/creatinine quotients were also related to the urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and albumin/creatinine quotients. Presence of DMSA uptake defects, reflecting local inflammation, in children in the acute phase of pyelonephritis, were associated with elevated urine IL-6/creatinine quotients (median 27 pg/mumol); in children without DMSA changes there was no increase in quotients (median non-detectable) (P < 0.05). Persistent DMSA changes at the 1-year follow-up, probably reflecting renal scarring, were only seen in children with increased urine IL-6/creatinine quotients in the acute phase (P < 0.01). No correlation was found between urine IL-8 and DMSA uptake defects. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) at 6-8 weeks did not correlate with the urine cytokine levels in the acute phase. The urine excretion of NAG and albumin, reflecting renal dysfunction, was associated with values of both urine IL-6 and IL-8/creatinine quotients, but not with DMSA defects or VUR. Thus, the initial urine IL-6/creatinine quotients might be used as an indicator of risk for persistent renal damage in acute pyelonephritis."}

In terms of future morbidity and mortality, one of the most important considerations in urinary tract infection is the age of the patient. In adults, only those with complications or illnesses that fail to respond to treatment require investigation to exclude underlying pathology. In contrast, the young are at risk of future hypertensive and renal disease; imaging techniques are therefore of paramount importance to identify those with renal parenchymal disease at an early stage and permit appropriate and adequate treatment. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy is emerging as the method of choice for this purpose, because it combines high specificity and sensitivity with convenience, repeatability, and acceptable radiation doses. Voiding cystourethrography will also be required in many cases to exclude bladder pathology. New developments include the use of color Doppler ultrasonography and the nuclear magnetic resonance technique of rapid acquisition recall echo urography, both of which may become of value for the detection of scarring."}

We examined the urinanalysis (UA) findings on admission among infants less than 16 weeks old, with and without acute pyelonephritis (APN), as defined by the dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan findings, performed during a 57-month period. Forty-nine cases with a positive DMSA scan were compared with 79 negative study cases. A negative UA for leukocytes (< 5 white blood cells/high power field) was found in 4 of 49 (8.1%) cases with APN by DMSA, and in 34 of 79 (43%) cases with a negative DMSA (odds ratio 10.88 (95% confidence interval, 2.31 to 70.3; P < 0.001)). Three of the 4 infants not suspected to have APN by their UA findings would have been admitted for a full sepsis workup based on their clinical presentation and/or their laboratory findings on admission.

Three groups of patients were compared: group 1, patients with an abnormal lower urinary tract and deteriorating renal function (n = 9); group 2, abnormal lower urinary tract and stable renal function (n = 5); and group 3, normal lower urinary tract and deteriorating renal function (n = 8). Eight of the nine patients in group 1 had multiple scars visible on 99mTc DMSA scans and this correlated with histology when a renal biopsy was performed; the only patient without scars had a transplant glomerulopathy. The presence of scars was associated with either raised intravesical pressures or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Only one patient in each of groups 2 and 3 had visible scars and both these patients had a history of recurrent UTIs. Patients in group 3 with deteriorating renal function due to chronic rejection documented by biopsy did not have cortical scars visible with 99mTc DMSA tomography. 99mTc DMSA scanning with tomography is a useful investigation in the management of renal transplant patients with declining renal function; multiple scars may indicate abnormal lower urinary tract function and are not seen in chronic rejection."}

Urinary infection (n = 20) and urosepticaemia (n = 6) always brought about the urinary excretion of alpha 2-macroglobulin and CRP, as well as a usually highly positive haemoglobin test. alpha 2-Macroglobulin was absent but CRP always present in extrarenal bacterial infections (n = 30). Postrenal blood admixture was always characterized by a positive haemoglobin test and alpha 2-macroglobulin in urine, while in most cases (83%) CRP was absent. --These results indicate that the constellation \"alpha 2-macroglobulin negative/CRP positive\" is a pathognomonic for extrarenal bacterial infection (sensitivity 100%, specificity 98.9%).

The significant decrease of urinary NAG activity was common in patients with recently diagnosed rheumatic diseases, who received steroids. The decrease of NAG enzymuria was correlated with biochemical indices of inflammation like ESR or hemoglobin. The use of two types of potentially nephrotoxic drugs, like NSAID and gentamicin or NSAID with cyclosporin induced significant augmentation of NAG excretion. This occurrence may precede azotemia.

In order to evaluate the accuracy of sonography in monitoring RNP 63 patients suffering from VUR (mean age: 8.8 years, range: newborn to 18 years, male:female = 19:44) were examined prospectively. We calculated renal size sonographically and compared our data to static and dynamic renographic findings. Our results showed a good correlation between relative DMSA uptake and sonographically estimated relative renal size (r = 0.95, P < 0.001), whereas not unexpectedly the correlation between relative kidney function and sonographically estimated renal size was poor (r = 0.83, P < 0.01). We therefore believe, that in monitoring children with VUR, sonography can offer accurate information on questions about renal size and renal parenchymal structure as well as pelvic distention.

This study was undertaken to corroborate SPECT dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphic findings with specific histopathology in acute pyelonephritis. Unilateral vesicoureteral reflux was produced in 19 Yorkshire piglets 3 to 4 weeks old. The bladders of 12 animals were inoculated with Escherichia coli 2 weeks later, after baseline SPECT DMSA scans had been obtained. The animals were then re-imaged at 3 (4), 7 (4) or 14 (4) days after infection and sacrificed for histological evaluation. Seven purposefully uninfected piglets with unilateral reflux served as controls and were followed for up to 6 weeks before imaging and sacrifice. SPECT proved to be 97% sensitive and 93% specific in providing the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The SPECT findings were manifest by a spectrum of abnormal findings (mottling, striations, inner cortical scalloping and focal cortical defects), which correlated precisely with the extent and severity of cortical involvement in the acute pyelonephritic process. We propose a new classification scheme for SPECT DMSA renal scintigraphic imaging, and believe that this modality is exquisitely sensitive in providing the diagnosis as well as in evaluating the extent of renal parenchymal involvement when acute pyelonephritis is induced in the animal model."}

The study included 52 children, 2 months to 16 years old, who had DMSA scintigraphy and renal sonography on the same day. The sonographic and scintigraphic studies were interpreted independently.

Renal volumes were calculated by using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid. The standard deviation of the differences (SDD) between relative renal function and relative renal volume was calculated, and the limits of agreement were derived. Thirty-three children had normal renal morphology on both studies. Twenty-five kidneys in 19 children were abnormal on one or both studies, including 14 definitely scarred kidneys in 12 children. Relative function of the right kidney in patients with normal kidneys was 50.1 +/- 2.5%, including one possible outlying value. Normal relative volume of the right kidney was 49.1 +/- 3.1%. In patients with normal kidneys, the difference between relative function and relative volume of the right kidney was 1.0 +/- 2.8% with 95% limits of agreement of 6.7% and -4.7%. Agreement between relative function and relative volume was worse for children with abnormal kidneys; the mean difference was 2.0%, and the largest observed difference was 10.9%.

However, its role in the evaluation of renal cortical defects compared to planar scintigraphy has not been fully assessed. We wished to determine whether SPECT increases the sensitivity for detecting renal cortical defects in children compared to high-resolution planar scintigraphy. Forty-one children (90 renal units) with underlying vesicoureteric reflux and/or recently treated urinary tract infection (UTI) were evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of defects detected between a single-head SPECT system and high-resolution planar scintigraphy, 24 and 20, respectively (P = 0.54). There were four defects detected by SPECT not reported by planar scintigraphy; two of these were only seen retrospectively on planar scintigraphy. There were two children with renal cortical defects detected by SPECT and not by planar scintigraphy. All defects defected by planar scintigraphy were detected by SPECT. It is concluded that although the risk of missing renal cortical defects is low when using high-resolution, three-view planar scintigraphy, SPECT should be employed whenever feasible. Single photon emission computed tomography detected renal cortical defects in children not diagnosed by planar scintigraphy and hence patient management may be altered."}

Scintigraphic evaluation of urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, and renal scarring represents a significant portion of a clinical pediatric nuclear medicine practice. Renal scarring from recurring infection remains an important cause of end-stage renal disease and hypertension in the pediatric population. However, the clinical presentation in infants and young children is often elusive, and clinical diagnosis of upper tract involvement is frequently unreliable. As a result, diagnostic imaging has a critical role to play in the localization of infection to the lower or upper urinary tract. Radionuclide cystography and renal cortical imaging have become mainstays of this evaluation. Direct radionuclide cystography is the preferred cystographic screening technique, because it has lower radiation exposure and greater sensitivity for the detection of vesicoureteral reflux than either indirect radionuclide cystography or fluoroscopic contrast cystography. Renal cortical scintigraphy has become the standard for the detection of pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Correlation with histopathology has demonstrated a high degree of diagnostic accuracy. Acute pyelonephritis has been shown to be the necessary etiologic factor for the development of subsequent renal scarring, and the mechanism of renal injury in pyelonephritis has been extensively studied in experimental models. The ability of prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy to dramatically reduce the incidence of subsequent scarring also has been conclusively demonstrated both clinically and in the experimental model. Vesicoureteral reflux was once thought to be a necessary prerequisite for the development of renal scarring. Although it is clear that the intrarenal reflux of infected urine will create pyelonephritis in the experimental model, the high incidence of pyelonephritis and subsequent scarring in the absence of demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux leaves the role of reflux in question. Although the role of vesicoureteral reflux is incompletely understood, its detection nevertheless remains a standard part of the patient's evaluation."}

Renal contours and parenchyma were assessed in three zones.

Two nuclear medicine physicians blindly reviewed 57 DMSA scintigraphy on two occasions each. Disagreement of each observer's evaluation of the same scintigraphy on two different occasions was described as intraobserver variability, and the comparison between readings by each of the two observers was described as interobserver variability. High levels of intra- (95.9% and 90.6% respectively, p < 0.05) and interobserver agreement (84.4%, p < 0.05) were demonstrated. There were minor differences in inconsistencies between the two kidneys or different kidney zones.

Renal imaging with technetium 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) has shown promise but its efficacy for detecting acute pyelonephritis is still debated as is its ability to differentiate between acute, potentially curable disease and scarring, definitive changes. The files of all the 166 patients that underwent one or two (32 patients) 99mTc-DMSA imaging sessions for UTI in 1989 and 1990 in our department were analysed. The results of this technique were compared with the clinical and laboratory data and with those of other imaging techniques (ultrasonography and retrograde voiding cystourethrogram). The patients (92 girls and 74 boys, mean age: 5 years, range 15 days-17 years) were assigned to one of 3 categories: 1) acute pyelonephritis (27 patients), 2) low UTI (60 patients) and 3) uncertain UTI (79 patients), on the basis of the clinical and laboratory data. The first 99mTc-DMSA imaging was normal in 110 children; changes were unilateral in 45 and bilateral in 11 children. Images suggesting either acute or chronic changes were observed respectively in 19 and 48 children. 4 of the 7 acute changes were normalized on the second radioisotope scanning while 2 became worse; 19 of the 23 chronic changes were unchanged at the second scanning. Radioisotope scanning changes were seen in 81% of the patients classified as acute pyelonephritis and in only 27% of those with lower UTI. Reflux was detected in 56% of abnormal kidneys and in 36% of normal kidneys. The results of radioisotope scanning and ultrasound scan findings were not correlated in 24 patients (19 only abnormal radioisotope imaging, 5 only abnormal ultrasound scan). DMSA scans are useful for investigating and following UTI. They help to distinguish acute pyelonephritis and lower UTI.

Although 17 patients (60.7%) had complications of pyuria before treatment, none of the 28 patients had taken any prophylactic antibiotics during the treatment. To evaluate the clinical signs of infection, we examined the white blood cell count, in blood and urine sediment and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) value at the time of 1, 3 and 7 days after ESWL treatment, and body temperature and urine culture at the time immediately after the treatment in addition to the above-mentioned days, compared with the pre-treatment data. White blood cell count at one day after ESWL treatment was significantly elevated both in the patients with and without pyuria, while body temperature at the time immediately after the treatment was significantly elevated only in the patients with pyuria. Six of the 23 patients (26.1%) with preoperative sterile urine and who had urine culture immediately after ESWL, had bacteriuria. However, none of the 28 patients had any clinically significant infectious complications during ESWL treatment without any antibiotics therapy.

Hemolysins are cytolytic proteins which have been extensively characterized at the molecular level, however, their in vivo functions remain unclear. This study analyzed the association of hemolysin production with the inflammatory response in patients with urinary tract infection (UTI). Infants and children with their first episode of UTI (n = 644) were followed prospectively. The body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urinary leucocyte count and renal concentrating capacity were used as measures of the inflammatory response. The hemolytic genotype (hly) of the Escherichia coli strain from each UTI episode was defined by DNA-DNA hybridization, and the phenotype by hemolysis in blood agar. There was no significant increase in the level of fever, CRP, ESR, or decrease in renal concentrating capacity during UTI episodes caused by hly positive compared to hly negative E. coli. Multiple regression analysis did not demonstrate significant associations of hly with elevated fever, CRP, ESR or reduced renal concentrating capacity. In contrast, patients infected with P fimbriated E. coli strains had higher fever, CRP, ESR and lower renal concentrating capacity than those infected with other strains. This association was not influenced by the hly genotype of the P fimbriated strains. The frequency of hly+ strains was not significantly higher in the subset of patients assigned a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis compared to asymptomatic bacteriuria. This was in contrast to P fimbriae, which were accumulated in acute pyelonephritis. The results suggested that the acute inflammatory response to E. coli UTI is independent of hemolysin production. The inflammatogenic potential of uropathogenic E. coli clones was better described by the presence or absence of P-fimbriae than by hemolysin."}

Congenital urinary tract obstruction is a common cause of renal failure accounting for up to 20% of end-stage renal disease cases. Intrauterine obstruction often results in parenchymal loss and renal dysfunction. The pathophysiology of obstructive nephropathy and its further depression of renal function is related to severe renal vasoconstriction, which is in large part angiotensin mediated. Signs suggestive of urinary obstruction in the newborn may include an abdominal mass, hypertension, oligoanuria/polyuria, urosepsis, and hyperchloremic acidosis. The combination of renal ultrasound, diuretic renal scans, and voiding cystourethrogram are the main diagnostic modalities in infants with hydronephrosis. Nonsurgical management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction has become more popular, particularly in mild to moderate cases. Early fulguration or bypassing the obstruction of urethral valves is essential and a decrease in serum creatinine to below 1 mg/dL within 1 month of relief of obstruction is a favorable prognostic sign. Obstruction complicated by infection is dangerous and requires prompt intervention. Any newborn with a urinary tract infection, regardless of sex, should be presumed to have urinary obstruction or reflux until proven otherwise."}

Grade of reflux was predominantly severe, with grade III or higher noted in 83% of the patients. Prenatal and postnatal ultrasound failed to detect any abnormality in 29 refluxing units (45%) discovered contralateral to the known abnormal system, although 19 had grade III or higher reflux. Of the 64 refluxing units 8 underwent primary ureteral reimplantation, 12 were lost to followup and 44 were managed conservatively for a mean of 3.3 years. Reflux ceased in 61% of the cases, improved in 14% and remained unchanged in 23%. In only 1 unit did the grade of reflux increase. Documented urinary tract infection occurred in 6 of the 39 reflux patients. Dimercaptosuccinic acid renography performed in 21 infection-free patients demonstrated global reduction in renal parenchyma in 4 units, focal parenchymal defects in 3 and normal function in 14. Conservative postnatal management of fetal vesicoureteral reflux is justified. Global and focal parenchymal changes can occur in the kidneys of infants with reflux despite the absence of urinary tract infection."}

The diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux was made significantly earlier in boys than in girls regardless of reflux grade (p < 0.001). At entry reflux nephropathy was present on a dimercaptosuccinic acid scan in 44% of 314 refluxing kidneys. There was no significant difference between boys and girls in the prevalence of reflux nephropathy. The renal lesions were more severe in boys independently of the grade of vesicoureteral reflux (p < 0.05). Breakthrough urinary tract infection was significantly more common in girls than in boys, regardless of vesicoureteral reflux grade (p < 0.05). Mean followup was 68.7 +/- 31.2 months. Patient age at the time of the first of 2 radionuclide cystograms without vesicoureteral reflux was considered the age of spontaneous resolution of reflux. Using life table estimations and analyzing data stratified to sex and grade of vesicoureteral reflux, we found that although reflux lasted longer in boys compared to girls, this difference was not statistically significant. During followup new scars developed in 7 patients related to breakthrough urinary tract infection. There was no significant difference between boys and girls in the development of new scars. To understand the natural history of vesicoureteral reflux children must be stratified by sex and grade of reflux."}

Voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide cystography should be performed in the child in whom it is important to know whether reflux is present. Voiding cystourethrography is more accurate in characterizing and grading reflux, and monitoring is intermittent. Conversely, radionuclide cystography uses a lower radiation dose and its continuous monitoring leads to fewer false negative results but its ability to characterize reflux is poor. The performance of voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide cystography to detect reflux is an art as well as a science. These tests are done best by those who are experienced and interested in imaging the urinary tract of the child. At our hospital we perform voiding cystourethrography in all young children with urinary tract infection to detect and precisely characterize reflux to enable intelligent planning of management. In older patients, when it is less likely that reflux is present but it is still desirable to ensure that reflux is not occurring, radionuclide cystography is performed. If reflux is present, then a decision is made on an individual basis as to whether additional characterization by voiding cystourethrography is needed. Radionuclide cystography is also used for family screening, for periodic followup of reflux being managed nonoperatively and to ensure that reflux has been eliminated after antireflux surgery."}

Correlation of virulence factors of Escherichia coli with renal inflammation documented by 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan was undertaken in 59 children with febrile urinary tract infections to identify more accurately the role of bacterial virulence factors in the development of pyelonephritis. P fimbriae were present in 63% of isolates from the positive scan group and 83% of those from the negative scan group (P = 0.126). Multivariate regression analysis showed no significant role for established E. coli virulence factors in the development of pyelonephritis. The pap genome was independently associated with negative scan (P less than 0.007) and with the absence of reflux (P = 0.031). E. coli pyelonephritogenic clone O16:K1:H6 was isolated from negative scan patients and did not produce hemolysin. We conclude that P fimbriae are important in the development of febrile urinary tract infection regardless of the level of infection. Virulent E. coli clones described in prior Scandinavian urinary tract infection studies were not common causes of pyelonephritis in our patient population."}

Sixty-two children were reinvestigated approximately 2 months later when intravenous urography (IVU) and micturition cysto-urethrography were also performed. During infection, 92% of the children showed changes in the DMSA scan with 69% by US, and the two investigations agreed in 58% of the kidneys. At follow-up, 68% showed changes in the DMSA scan, 47% by US and 48% by IVU. The DMSA scan and IVU agreed in 60% of the kidneys. Twenty-nine percent of the children had vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). The presence of grade greater than or equal to 3 VUR was associated with greater defects on the DMSA scan during infection, and at follow-up with a higher frequency of persistent changes compared with no VUR (P less than 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). During infection the size of the defect on the DMSA scan correlated with renal volume and C-reactive protein and inversely with the glomerular filtration rate, and at follow-up it correlated inversely with the renal concentration capacity. The DMSA scan is a sensitive method for diagnosing and localizing APN in children, and findings on DMSA scan show a weak but significant correlation with routine clinical and radiological parameters. It is suggested that persistent renal damage after APN in children without VUR may be more common than previously assumed."}

Our experience of its use in 100 infants and children for renography and indirect micturating cystography (IMC) is reported. The average age was 5.6 years. 65 patients completed IMC studies and nine patients had 99Tcm-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99Tcm-DMSA) scans performed on the same day. The majority of patients were referred for the investigation of urinary tract infection. 32 kidneys were found to be scarred on 99Tcm-MAG3 scans, 17 kidneys and ureters refluxed on IMC and 14 kidneys were obstructed. The results of 99Tcm-MAG3 scans were compared with those of other urinary tract investigations including ultrasound, micturating cystography (MCUG), intravenous urography (IVU) and 99Tcm-DMSA scintigraphy. No kidney which was scarred had a normal 99Tcm-MAG3 scan. All significant degrees of dilatation or obstruction on IVU or ultrasound were also detected by 99Tcm-MAG3. 99Tcm-MAG3 gave more information than any other single imaging modality and we believe it represents an ideal initial screening test in the investigation of urinary tract infection in older toilet-trained children."}

The presence of focal renal damage dictates different management of a child with urinary tract infection (UTI) compared with children who have normal kidneys. Technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic (DMSA) has a high sensitivity in the detection of a focal defect, and allows estimation of differential function. The introduction of 99mTc-MAG3 with high renal extraction suggests that this may be useful in children with UTI but its role remains speculative. Fifty-nine children with previous UTI underwent both 99mTc-DMSA and MAG3 within 4 wk of each other. Differential function and assessment of the images were undertaken. There is close correlation (R2 = 0.97) between the differential function. Analysis of the 99mTc-DMSA and functional MAG3 images showed that the functional image had a specificity of 88% and a sensitivity of 88% in the detection of a focal parenchymal defect. Technetium-99m-MAG3 in the clinical setting of a child with UTl allows accurate assessment of differential function and a high probability of detecting a focal renal abnormality."}

DMSA scans performed within 72 hours of presentation in 65 previously healthy children with acute urinary tract infection were abnormal in 34 (52%). The scan appearances of 30 of 36 (83%) initially abnormal kidneys improved or became normal on the repeat DMSA study performed at 3 to 6 months after the acute urinary tract infection. A cystogram demonstrated significant vesicoureteral reflux in 11 of 45 cases (24%). Of these 11 cases 10 had abnormal DMSA studies and 1 had dilated upper tracts on ultrasound. Several conclusions may be drawn from our study. The incidence of DMSA abnormalities at the time of acute urinary tract infection is high but these abnormalities tend to resolve with time. An abnormal DMSA study at the time of urinary tract infection identifies most children with significant vesicoureteral reflux, and in our series a combination of ultrasound and DMSA identified all cases. This study may have major implications for the clinical investigation of children with urinary tract infection."}

Renal cortical scintigraphy has been reported to be useful in children for confirmation of the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Subsequent experimental studies have demonstrated that dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, when compared directly with histopathology, is highly reliable for the detection and localization of parenchymal inflammatory changes associated with acute pyelonephritis. Recent clinical studies of acute pyelonephritis using DMSA scintigraphy reveal that the majority (50 to 91%) of children with febrile urinary tract infections have abnormal DMSA renal scan findings and that the majority of these children do not have demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux. However, when vesicoureteral reflux is present, renal cortical abnormalities are demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy in 79 to 86% of the kidneys. In children with febrile urinary tract infections routine clinical and laboratory parameters are not reliable in the differentiation of acute pyelonephritis, documented by DMSA renal scan findings, from urinary tract infections without parenchymal involvement. Furthermore, the presence of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli associated with febrile urinary tract infections does not reliably predict those kidneys that have acute parenchymal inflammation demonstrated by DMSA renal scans. DMSA is also the isotope agent of choice for the detection of renal scarring. Clinical studies report greater sensitivity of DMSA renal scintigraphy for the detection of renal scarring when compared with the excretory urogram, particularly in infants and young children. In a recent prospective study of post-pyelonephritic renal scarring in children we found that acquired renal scarring only occurs in sites corresponding exactly to previous areas of acute pyelonephritis demonstrated by DMSA scintigraphy at the time of infection. Furthermore, once acute pyelonephritis occurs, ultimate renal scarring is independent of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux. These findings provide convincing evidence that renal parenchymal infection, rather than vesicoureteral reflux, is the prerequisite for acquired (postnatal) renal scarring. Vesicoureteral reflux as a risk factor for acquired renal scarring is directly related to its role as a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis. We conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a valid tool for confirming the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children and for identifying kidneys at risk for subsequent renal scarring."}

Static isotope imaging with 99mtechnetium-dimercaptosuccinic acid was performed at a mean age of 34 days in 32 children (50 kidneys) whose vesicoureteral reflux had been identified as a result of prenatal ultrasound scanning. Three patterns of isotope uptake were observed: 1) noninfected primary vesicoureteral reflux (15 children, 24 kidneys), 2) noninfected secondary (obstructed) vesicoureteral reflux (9 patients, 11 kidneys) and 3) infected primary reflux (8 infants, 15 kidneys). In 20 pattern 1 kidneys (83%) renal morphology and differential isotope were normal. In the 4 kidneys (17%) that showed evidence of impaired function this took the form of global parenchymal loss, that is small kidneys rather than focal scarring. In pattern 2 the combination of fetal vesicoureteral reflux and obstruction was a potent cause of renal damage with total or near total loss of function in 7 of 9 refluxing units associated with posterior urethral valves and in 2 kidneys with secondary ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Appearances of focal scarring were confined in pattern 3 and were found in 4 kidneys (27%). This overall incidence of detectable renal damage was lower than expected. Even when infection occurs, prenatal diagnosis may lessen the risk of scarring by enabling treatment to be instituted promptly. The findings suggest that uncomplicated primary vesicoureteral reflux is a relatively benign insult to the fetal kidney and that reflux nephropathy found in children presenting clinically is the result of infected vesicoureteral reflux in postnatal life. Any comparison of published studies will prove difficult until there is a more standardized approach to imaging technique and patient selection."}

However, due to uncertainties about the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical and laboratory parameters used in these studies, true sensitivity of renal cortical scintigraphy was unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of [99mTc]DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis of experimentally induced acute pyelonephritis in piglets using strict histopathologic criteria as the standard of reference. The sensitivity and specificity of the DMSA scan for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis were 91% and 99%, respectively, with an overall 97% agreement between the scintigraphic and histopathologic findings. Based on the results of this experimental study, we used the [99mTc]DMSA scan as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, and conducted a prospective clinical study of 94 children hospitalized with the diagnosis of acute febrile urinary tract infection (UTI).

Using the DMSA scan we prospectively evaluated renal scarring after reflux and nonreflux pyelonephritis in children. The study population consisted of 33 patients with acute pyelonephritis documented by a DMSA renal scan at infection. The children were evaluated for renal scarring with a followup DMSA scan 4 to 42 months (mean 10.7 months) after the acute infection. All new scarring on followup DMSA scans occurred at sites corresponding exactly to areas of acute inflammation on the initial DMSA scan. Therefore, only those kidneys with acute changes on the initial scan were subsequently analyzed. Of 38 kidneys new or progressive scarring developed in 16 (42%), including 6 of 15 (40%) with associated vesicoureteral reflux and 10 of 23 (43%) without demonstrable reflux. New renal scarring developed in 6 of the 7 kidneys (86%) associated with a neuropathic bladder or posterior urethral valves. In contrast, new scarring developed in only 10 of 31 kidneys (32%) associated with a normal bladder (p = 0.028). Excluding the kidneys associated with a neuropathic bladder or posterior urethral valves, new renal scarring developed in 3 of 12 (25%) with primary reflux, compared with 7 of 19 (37%) without vesicoureteral reflux. Except for the white blood count and the species of infecting bacteria, no other statistically significant differences could be found between those cases in which scars did or did not develop. We conclude that acquired renal scarring only occurs at sites corresponding to previous areas of acute pyelonephritis, the acute parenchymal inflammatory changes of acute pyelonephritis are reversible and do not lead to new renal scarring in the majority of cases, and once acute pyelonephritis has occurred ultimate renal scarring is independent of the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux."}

The prompt notification of extreme CRP value is an important aspect of medical care. The examination of urine and cerebrospinal fluid and ultrasonography are necessary screening techniques accompanying examination of blood and plain chest X-ray. Urea-N, cholinesterase and albumin values should be determined at the same time as CRP value to assess prognosis."}

We investigated the clinical and laboratory data of 215 hospitalized patients (mean age were 76.9 +/- 12.1) to analyze both the characteristics of senile UTI and the influence of the way of urination. UTI was present in 121 of 1897 patients (6.4%), 95 of whom (78.5%) were female. Comparison of the parameters between non-infected and infected patients were as follows: body temperature was 36.57 +/- 0.64 degrees C vs. 37.49 +/- 0.77 degree C; WBC, 5410 +/- 2040/microliters vs. 7260 +/- 3230/microliters; CRP, 1.2 +/- 2.4 mg/dl vs. 3.5 +/- 3.4 mg/dl; mean class of urinary RBC, 0-1/hpf vs. 3-5/hpf; and mean class of urinary WBC, 5-10/hpf vs. 30-50/hpf. All parameters were significantly elevated (p < 0.001) in the patients with UTI. The rate of detection of causative bacteria was 88.7%; with 14.8% Escherichia coli, 12.8% Providencia species, 9.6% Enterococci, and 8.7% Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with UTI were divided into three groups according to their method of urination: normal urination, use of diapers and catheterization. Body temperature (> or = 37.5 degrees C) was 2.8%, 10.1% and 34.9%; WBC (> or = 9.000), 2.7%, 6.1%, and 14.3%; CRP, 16.9%, 36.1% and 51.1%; urine RBC (> or = 6-10/hpf), 8.4%, 7.1% and 36.1%; urine WBC (> or = 15-30/hpf), 20.4%, 44.4% and 76.9%, respectively. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05-0.001) between all parameters except for urine RBC between the normal-urination patients and diaper using patients. This investigation suggested that the use of diapers was a risk factor for UTI in elderly patients."}

Fifty 111indium leukocyte ( 111In WBC) scans were performed to determine their usefulness in the organ transplant patient. The results were compared with computerized tomography (CT) and gallium 67-citrate (Ga) scanning. Eleven patients received both 111In WBC and Ga scans; 22 received both 111In WBC and CT scans. Ten 111In WBC scans had subtraction of 99m Tc sulfur or albumin colloid for liver evaluation and four 111In WBC scans had subtraction of 99m Tc DMSA for kidney evaluation. The overall sensitivity and specificity for 111In WBC scans was 90% and 90%, respectively. Lung uptake was sensitive (89%) and specific (97%) for pulmonary infections, including bacterial, fungal and cytomegalovirus pneumonias. Renal graft uptake occurred in 15 cases (41%), all except 2 being due to rejection, pyelonephritis, urinary tract infections, or cytomegalovirus infections. Pyelonephritis and renal abscesses were diagnosed in 3 cases with 99m Tc DMSA subtraction. Perihepatic abscesses (2), and infected liver cysts (4) were diagnosed with 99m Tc sulfur or albumin colloid subtraction. There were five false-negative CT scans and three false-negative Ga scans.

Associated genitourinary anomalies were common, occurring in 29% of the patients. Some element of hydroureteronephrosis was noted at initial cystography in 89% of refluxing renal units, but the degree of renal abnormality at 99Tc DMSA renography was not predicted by the severity of VUR. Overall, 60% of refluxing renal units were renographically abnormal. Although a high rate of urinary infection was encountered during follow-up, most DMSA assessments were carried out prior to infection and hence likely reflect congenital rather than acquired abnormalities. It was concluded that renal impairment associated with high grade primary VUR is frequently present at birth and not secondary to subsequent infection."}

Body temperature, CRP, ESR, pyuria, and renal concentrating capacity were analyzed in 692 children with first-time urinary tract infections. The association of the parameters was evaluated by correlation and multiple regression analysis. The body temperature, CRP, and ESR were significantly correlated (r = .54, .58, and .58; P less than .001), and variation in CRP and ESR explained approximately 40% of the variation in fever. In contrast, the renal concentrating capacity and pyruia were weakly or not at all correlated with the febrile response (r = -.22; P less than .001), and less than 10% of the variation in renal concentrating capacity was explained by the other parameters. The results suggest that fever, CRP, and ESR describe the same aspect of the host response to UTI."}

Forty-two of them presented ureterosigmoidostomy and 15 orthotopic ileal bladder. The CT appearance of the normal post-cystectomy pelvis is emphasized. Both early and late surgical and neoplastic complications were detected. Early surgical complications, including urinary fistulae, urinomas, seromas, lymphoceles, and abscesses, were diagnosed over a 6-month postoperative period. Late surgical complications included hydroureteronephrosis, calculosis, and pyelonephritis. Hydroureteronephrosis, due to stenosis of the ureteral anastomosis, was the most frequent complication. All such neoplastic complications as local recurrence, lymphnode distant metastases, were identified. In 83% of cases they were observed over a 2-year postoperative period. Distant metastases in the upper abdomen were never detected. The authors' experience suggests the following as the optimal follow-up: a) CT examination over a 6-month postoperative period; b) yearly CT examinations and urography over 4 postoperative years; c) yearly US examination over the first 2 years after surgery, to depict renal pelvis dilatation. Skeletal scintigraphy is often necessary to detect metastatic bone lesions. It should be performed no later than 2 years after cystectomy."}

This study was undertaken to determine the extent of primary vesicoureteric reflux and renal scarring in patients investigated for urinary tract infection in the Singapore General Hospital between 1983 and 1988. The clinical profile of patients and possible clinical features associated with renal scarring were analysed. These findings serve as a useful guide in the investigation and management of VUR in our population. The incidence of vesicoureteric reflux among patients investigated for documented urinary tract infection was high at 32.9%. The mean age at presentation was 15.2 months. Almost all patients were less than five years-old. A male predominance was noted in affected infants. High grade refluxes of Grade IV or more (International Reflux Study Classification) were found in 45.7/patients and were associated with a higher incidence of recurrent urinary tract infection (p less than 0.05). Thirty-four 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scans were done and 46.4% of refluxing kidneys showed renal scars. The incidence of renal scarring was significantly higher in patients presenting at an early age (less than 2 years), in high grade reflux and in recurrent urinary tract infection (p less than 0.05; p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001 respectively). Therefore all children with documented urinary tract infection who are less than five years old and especially male infants should be fully investigated for early detection and treatment of vesicoureteric reflux and renal scars. Kidneys with vesicoureteric reflux at risk of scarring appeared to be those with early presentation, high grade reflux and recurrent urinary tract infection whose management should therefore be vigorous."}

More abnormalities were detected by DMSA study when compared to scars on IVP. When both studies were abnormal there was an excellent correlation on a site by site basis. Fever or systemic disorder was not a reliable sign to determine whether there was upper tract involvement with infection. The incidence of DMSA abnormalities in infants increased with high grade vesicoureteral reflux and decreased with low grade reflux. There was no significant difference in the incidence of abnormal kidneys between the infected and noninfected groups, suggesting that renal scarring may occur with sterile reflux."}

The paper examines the relationship between the clinical manifestations of pyelonephritis and the functional activity of enzymes of cation transmembrane erythrocyte transport (Mg(2+)-, N(+)-K(+)-, Ca(2+)-ATPases). An individual analysis ascertained that the patients who showed a low Ca(2+)-ATPase activity had marked signs of inflammation in the body, as evidenced by ESR, seromucoid and fibrinogen concentrations. These patients had more significantly depressed immune defense mechanisms as reflected by the levels of immunoglobulins, T-lymphocytes, complement, the neutrophil phagocytosis, and urinary IgA concentrations). Variations were also found in examining the excretion of a number of metabolites. There was a substantial decrease in urea, creatinine, titrated acid, phosphorus excretions in patients with deficient Ca(2+)-ATPase activity than in those with its high activity. It was concluded that there was a relationship between some clinical manifestations of pyelonephritis and the functional activity of enzymes of cation transmembrane transport.

The time-activity curves obtained with the two radionuclides agreed exactly. Reaching a tubular excretion rate of nearly 90%, the clearance of MAG3 differed by no more than 6% from the OIH clearance in 95% of the cases. The factor between clearances of the two radionuclides was determined by means of a commercially available software according to the Oberhausen method and amounted to 0.59 +/- 0.09. The favorable physical properties and high activity of MAG3 permit exact examination of tubular function and better assessment of renal morphology than hippuran-labelled radionuclides. The low radiation dose combined with a better spatial resolution, especially, the constant availability in a nuclear medicine department should give the preference to MAG3."}

A few weeks later she had increasing trouble with stiff knee and shoulder joints and the left foot became swollen. The subfebrile status continued, and tonsillitis was suspected and diagnosed. V-penicillin and cefaklor treatment was applied. She was transferred to the infectious diseases ware, where fever was confirmed with leukocytosis (19 x 1 billion/1), C-reactive protein at 66 (normal value 10) mcg/ml, pronounced blood pressure increase (160/130 mm Hg), anemic signs, and pathological liver status with increased transaminases (ASAT 6.3-10.4 and ALAT 8.,8-16 ukat/1).

Collagen disease was suspected, and she was transferred to the internal medicine department. She regularly had tachycardia and high blood pressure. She had to use crutches for mobility because of the pain. S-albumin was 32 (normal 36- 50) g/l and S-hepatoglobin was 2.7 (normal value .4-1.8) g.l. Various others tests were normal. Ulnaris neuropathy was suspected on the left hand. Intensive blood pressure reducing combination treatment was started with 200 mg x 1 of metoprolol, 10 mg x 2 nifedipin, and 20 mg x 1 enalapril.

Multiple clinical and laboratory variables commonly used in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis did not adequately predict the presence or absence of parenchymal involvement. These data show the following: (1) Acute pyelonephritis in the absence of demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux is common. (2) Febrile urinary tract infections in children are commonly associated with P-fimbriated E. coli, both in the presence and absence of vesicoureteral reflux.

The epithelial expression of the globo-A receptor was restricted to individuals of blood group A with a positive secretor state. Consequently, globo-A binding E. coli strains attached only to epithelial cells from these individuals. In contrast, globoside-recognizing strains attached in similar numbers to uroepithelial cells regardless of the ABH blood group and secretor state of the donor. The role of host receptor expression for infection with globo-A-specific E. coli was analyzed in 1,473 children with urinary tract infections. All those infected with strains exclusively expressing globo-A-specific adhesins were found to be of blood group A, compared with 45% in the population at large (P less than 0.006). The inflammatory response (fever, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) of individuals infected with these strains was lower than that in individuals with infections caused by globoside binding strains. The results demonstrate the importance of fitness between host receptors and bacterial adhesins for infection and suggest that minor receptor epitope differences have profound effects on the disease process."}

The renal function of sixty one adult patients was monitored by 99mTc-DMSA renal scan after cystectomy for a malignant tumour followed by ileal conduit urinary diversion. The postoperative follow-up period was 10 years. The stenosis rate of the uretero-ileal anastomosis was 12.8% and the incidence of pyelonephritis was 8% The mean value for overall renal function and for the function of each kidney did not deteriorate significantly (p = 0.1 and p = 0.7, respectively) over time. However, 26% of kidneys evaluated at 1 year and at 5 years showed a markedly decreased uptake on the renogram. In 70% of cases, this decreased uptake was related to the development of stenosis of the uretero-ileal anastomosis or pyelonephritis. Renal function remained stable at 5 years in group A, corresponding to patients with good initial renal function (n = 22, p = 0.07), and in group B, corresponding to patients with poor initial renal function (n = 7, p = 0.9). Similarly, the function of solitary kidneys did not deteriorate over the 5-year postoperative follow-up period (n = 7, p = 0.5). The functional value of the kidneys was therefore not globally altered after ileal conduit urinary diversion. The existence of a mechanical or infectious complication should be systematically investigated in the presence of a deterioration in renal function. DMSA isotope renal scan is a complete, qualitative and quantitative, follow-up examination after this type of urinary diversion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

The risks of acute pyelonephritis in infants concern microbial invasion and parenchymal damage.

Such parenchymal injury may lead to arterial hypertension, and renal failure when bilateral.

The relationship of vesicoureteric reflex (VUR) and renal scarring was studied in 94 children (188 kidneys) with proved urinary tract infection in a district general hospital. There were 61 girls and 33 boys, with nine girls and 17 boys aged less than 1 year, 31 girls and nine boys aged between 1 and 5 years, the remaining 28 children were over 5 years of age. All children had a micturating cystourethrogram and a 99mTc (technetium) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Forty two of the 188 kidneys were scarred and 70 of the kidneys had VUR. Only 37.1% of the kidneys with reflux were scarred but 61.9% of the scarred kidneys had VUR. In children of less than 1 year, 48% of kidneys with VUR were scarred whereas 70.6% of scarred kidneys had reflux. In children between 1 and 5 years of age only 36.4% of kidneys with VUR were scarred but 63.2% of scarred kidneys had VUR. There is good correlation between the detection of a scarred kidney on DMSA and the presence of vesicoureteric reflux. However the detection of reflux particularly in children over 1 year of age shows poor correlation with renal scarring. This suggests that the primary imaging in children over 1 year of age presenting with a urinary tract infection should be of the kidney: a cystogram should be performed only if the DMSA scan is abnormal."}

Voiding cystourethrography (VCU) of 407 children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) at our hospital during 1969-1990 was reviewed and 7 cases (8 ureters) of intrarenal reflux (IRR) were found. All the children were male and had had an episode of febrile urinary infection under one year of age. One child had a left flank mass, which was later proven a urinoma. VUR was moderate (grade III) in 3 and massive (grade IV and V) in 5. VUR was estimated as primary in one child and as secondary in 6 (anterior urethral ring 2, posterior urethral valve 2, neurogenic bladder 2). IRR was localized to the upper area in 3, to the lower area in 2, and to the whole kidney in 3. Sixty percent of those with IRR in the polar areas was associated with moderate VUR, whereas all of those in the whole kidney was with massive one. Renal scarring was assessed by excretory urography (IVP) and/or 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy. Seven kidneys were evaluable; polar scars in 5, dwarf with polar scar in 1 and dwarf with poor function (suspected hypodysplasia) in 1. In 4 kidneys new scar formation was observed. It was noted, however, that IRR did not necessarily accompany renal scars of the corresponding areas and IRR to the whole kidney did not always lead to multiple scars in the whole kidney. The nature and problems of IRR, renal scars and 99mTc-DMSA renoscintigraphy were discussed. It was suggested that urinary infection played a greater part in renal scar formation."}

Ninety-one children 1 week to 10 years old with culture-documented febrile urinary tract infection were evaluated with renal sonography and renal cortical scintigraphy by using 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). On the basis of previous experimental studies, DMSA scintigraphy was used as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The DMSA scans showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 63% (57/91) of the patients. Sonograms showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 24% (22/91) of the whole group and in only 39% (22/57) of the patients with scintigraphically documented acute pyelonephritis. Pertinent sonographic findings were areas of increased cortical echogenicity in 14 patients and decreased echogenicity in eight, including three patients with renal abscesses. Dilatation of the renal collecting system was noted in nine patients and renal enlargement was noted in three. We conclude that renal sonography is a relatively insensitive test for the detection of acute inflammatory changes of renal cortex. Therefore, it should not be used as the primary imaging technique for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. However, sonography is a useful technique in evaluating the nature of the defects seen on the DMSA scan and in detecting obstructive uropathies that may be associated with urinary tract infections."}

Computerized tomography findings generally correlated well with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and presence of pyuria and flank pain.

Urinary levels of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) were measured in 147 consecutively enrolled children younger than 13 years of age with urinary tract infection to determine whether elevated levels were a predictor of urologic abnormalities. The children were classified as having cystitis if results of 0 or 1 of the following tests were positive and as having pyelonephritis if results of greater than or equal to 2 tests were positive: (1) temperature greater than 38 degrees C, (2) serum C-reactive protein greater than 1 mg/dL, (3) erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 25 mm/h, and (4) 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin-renal concentrating protein less than 810 mOsm/kg. Urinary NAG to creatinine ratios did not distinguish cases of cystitis from those of pyelonephritis. Urinary NAG was useful in identifying children with cystitis who had vesicoureteral reflux of grades II through V. Of 6 children with cystitis and vesicoureteral reflux, 5 had levels of NAG more than 1 SD above the mean, whereas of 75 children without vesicoureteral reflux, only 15 had such an elevation (P = .003). Of those children with a normal NAG level, 60 (98.4%) had normal radiologic evaluation results, and only 1 child (1.6%) had vesicoureteral reflux. Levels of NAG did not identify children with pyelonephritis who had vesicoureteral reflux. It is concluded that (1) urinary NAG is of no value in localizing the site of urinary tract infection, and (2) an NAG level within 1 SD of the mean in a child with cystitis indicates a low risk of urologic abnormalities, and radiologic evaluation may be omitted unless infection recurs."}

Escherichia coli (E. coli) causes greater than 90% of urinary tract infections, UTI, in childhood. The capacity to adhere to urinary tract epithelial cells characterizes E. coli strains that cause acute pyelonephritis. Adherence of uropathogenic E. coli is the result of a specific interaction between bacterial adhesins and glycolipid receptors on the host cells, especially the globoseries of glycolipids which share the Galactose alpha 1-greater than 4Galactose beta disaccharide (Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta). In childhood UTI, Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-binding bacteria caused significantly higher body temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and pyuria, and lower renal concentrating capacity, than E. coli lacking this specificity. The Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-binding bacteria thus appeared to be more potent inducers of inflammation than other strains. Since inflammation may lead to tissue damage we examined the relationship of infection with Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-positive bacteria to renal scarring. The frequency of renal scarring was 5% in boys with Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-positive and 40% in boys with Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta-negative E. coli. Bacterial binding to Gal alpha 1-greater than 4Gal beta can be detected with a commercially available test reagent. This reagent can thus be used as an effective predictor of risk for renal scarring. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pyrogen and inducer of the acute phase reactants. It was shown to be produced locally in the urinary tract, in response to UTI, and to spread systemically. Mucosal challenge with dead bacteria was sufficient to induce the IL-6 response. Circulating IL-6, and/or IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor could explain the fever, as well as increased ESR and CRP found in association with acute symptomatic UTI."}

Radioactive gallium citrate has been known to accumulate not only in neoplasms but also in inflammatory foci, and thus widely used to find out pyrogenic lesions in cases of unexplainable prolonged fever. However, with developments and improvements of other imaging modalities, its diagnostic significance may have changed. To probe that issue, recent 65 scans for the patients with fever of unknown origin were reviewed retrospectively. Of these, 56 had sufficient clinical assessment and laboratory examinations to evaluate causative illnesses. Gallium images of 33 patients were interpreted as positive. Local inflammatory lesions were detected in 23 cases, with lung tuberculosis, urinary tract infection, and inflammatory joint diseases as prevalent final diagnoses. Pyogenic abscesses, though popular in the literatures on fever of unknown origin, were found in only 2 cases in our present series. This seemed to be due to earlier detection of affected sites by other imaging technics. Osteomyelitis, other major cause of fever in the past, was not found this time, probably owing to wide use of antibiotics. Besides localized diseases, seven cases of generalized disorders were found. There were 3 patients with hematological malignancies, 3 with systemic autoimmune diseases, and 1 with severe infectious mononucleosis. There were three false positive cases; intestinal gallium radioactivity in 2 cases and physiological pulmonary hilar accumulation in 1 were erroneously read as abnormal. Of 23 cases with negative gallium scan, no definite cause of fever were found in 19; twelve patients had spontaneous reduction of fever, 2 did so with antibiotics, and 5 with corticosteroids. False negative cases were; two with urinary tract infection on antibiotics, one with bacterial meningitis, and one with polyarteritis nodosa. Our results reconfirmed the excellent sensitivity and accuracy of gallium scan in the diagnosis of fever of unknown origin. In addition to the detection of focal inflammations, it may sometimes contribute to an early diagnosis of unexpected systemic diseases. From the results obtained, it is advisable that, in patients with fever of unknown origin, this test should be done early in diagnostic schedule and before administration of drugs that may mask potential sites of abnormal accumulation."}

Clinical parameters of infection were fever, local pain and/or tenderness, a sactosalpinx or pyosalpinx at palpation and cervical secretion. Clinical cure was achieved in 77.3% in the ceftriaxone and in 78.9% in the cefotaxime group, improvement in 3 (13.6%) and 4 patients (21.0%), respectively. 2 clinical failures were seen in the ceftriaxone group.

The concentration of LMOX in the urine from the mild obstructed kidney was 124 to 2,140 micrograms/ml and 10 micrograms/ml in the severely obstructed ones. The difference was probably due to the intensity and the duration of the obstruction. The patient with 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake of less than 3% also had a urinary LMOX concentration of less than 7 micrograms/ml. The above results seem to show that 7 micrograms/ml in urinary LMOX concentration is a significant figure for treatment of UTI. 99mTc-DMSA renal uptake and renal echogram were used to estimate the excretion rate of antibiotics into the urine."}

The use of 99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) scintigraphy for the early diagnosis of pyelonephritis has been evaluated in a study performed on adolescent female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to an ascending Escherichia coli infection. The rats were studied with DMSA scintigraphy either before and 5 days after the infection or 5 and 28 days after the infection. One group of rats received anti-microbial treatment during days 6-11. After the last DMSA scintigraphy the rats were sacrificed and the kidneys prepared for light microscopy study. Kidney morphology was normal and DMSA uptake was high and homogeneous in all control rats. The majority of the rats exposed to E. coli developed inflammatory changes, on light microscopy which extended to various degrees in the renal parenchyma. Five days after the infection the DMSA uptake was consistently reduced, if the inflammatory lesion on light microscopy involved more than 15% of the renal cortex. Twenty-eight days after infection the inflammatory changes were less extensive than at 5 days. The DMSA uptake had usually improved. At this time, however, areas of decreased DMSA uptake could be detected even if the light microscopy changes involved less than 15% of the parenchyma. Microscopical lesions were less frequent and less extensive in the treated than in the untreated rats. The complete return to normal of previously abnormal DMSA uptake was only observed in treated rats. In a few untreated rats cortical scars had formed by day 28. The scars appeared in areas with decreased DMSA uptake at 5 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Sixty female piglets (62 refluxing units) were studied. Overall the sensitivity (true-positive/(true-positive + false-negative)) of DMSA scanning in detecting macroscopic scarring was 85% and the specificity (true-negative/(true-negative + false-positive)) was 97%. There were five false-negatives, four of which were in kidneys with minor scarring and one in which there was major scarring. There were three false-positives. We conclude that DMSA scanning has a high specificity and sensitivity in detecting renal scars in female piglets, and suggest it is the preferred method for detecting renal scars in clinical practice."}

To determine the impact of prenatal detection on neonates with hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system, we reviewed 40 such cases seen between June 1982 and April 1989. This six-per-year rate contrasts with fewer than one case per year that was seen at our hospital from 1947 to 1977. Nineteen patients had an ectopic ureterocele, and 21 had an ectopic ureter without a ureterocele. Thirty-three (83%) were girls. Thirty-three cases were discovered because of abnormal findings on a prenatal sonogram, and 20 of those infants were asymptomatic. In the 33 patients whose prenatal sonographic findings were abnormal, the sonogram was diagnostically precise for hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system in only 39%. This imprecision did not adversely affect management or outcome. Postnatal sonography modified the prenatal diagnosis in 75% of these 33 patients. Voiding cystourethrography was the most sensitive and precise imaging technique for detecting both ureterocele and reflux. Lower pole reflux was almost twice as common when an ectopic ureterocele was present (63%) than when one was not (33%). Prenatal sonographic detection of hydronephrosis of the upper pole of a duplex collecting system decreased the proportion of neonates presenting with urinary tract infection and urosepsis because of prophylactic antibiotics initiated at birth and continued until surgical correction.

This pharmacokinetic peculiarity seems to indicate that this antibiotic may be used in single doses in the therapy of lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants and children. The efficacy and safety of FT in single oral doses was compared with those of netilmicin (NM), an aminoglycoside antibiotic with a demonstrated efficacy in bolus doses against UTIs, shown in a multicentric study. One hundred and thirty-five children with lower UTI, diagnosed on the basis of fever (less than 38 degrees C), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (less than 25 mm/l h) and C-reactive protein (less than 20 micrograms/ml), were included in the study: 71 received 2 g of FT, 64 5 mg/kg of NM. Cure, defined as persistence of sterile urine up to 30 days after therapy, was reached in 80.2% of children in the FT group and in 81.2% of children in the NM group. Persistence of infection was demonstrated in 7 and in 3 children, respectively. Recurrence of infection was noticed in 7 patients in the FT group and in 9 in the NM group. No differences between FT- and NM-treated children are demonstrable even if the patient population is analyzed according to the higher risk of UTI because of the presence of an anatomical and/or functional abnormality of the urinary tract or due to a previous tendency to recurrent UTIs.

During a 2 year followup of 71 lupus patients, 38 episodes of disease exacerbation and 36 episodes of infection could be analyzed. Plasma samples were obtained at least once a month. CRP levels were increased (greater than 6 mg/l) during 25 of the 38 exacerbations and during 32 of the 36 infections. Median CRP levels during infection (60 mg/l; range 1-400) were higher than during disease exacerbation (16.5 mg/l; range 1-375) (p less than 0.05). Levels of CRP rose prior to the exacerbation (p less than or equal to 0.01) and fell afterwards (p less than or equal to 0.01). During exacerbations accompanied by serositis, median levels of CRP (76 mg/l; range 2-375) were higher than during exacerbations without serositis (16 mg/l; range 1-53) (p less than 0.02). CRP levels exceeding 60 mg/l during exacerbations without serositis indicated infection in all cases. Thus, measurement of CRP in SLE is valuable to distinguish between infection and exacerbation only in the absence of serositis."}

The mean ESR during the time of shock was lower than in the pre-shock and post-shock period. Hemoconcentration, low level of albumin and fibrinogen and the presence of disseminated intravascular clotting (DIC) in a majority of DHF patients are most likely responsible to this observed lower ESR especially during shock period. The determination of ESR, which is simple, is therefore useful in differentiating DHF from bacterial infections and dengue shock syndrome from septic shock."}

Impaired renal function including lack of function was demonstrated in 96.9 per cent of the patients with ureterovaginal fistulas, demonstrated by excretory urography, isotope nephrography and renal scintigraphy, whereas renal function in patients with vesicovaginal and urethrovaginal fistulas remained intact for a long time. In the authors' opinion, most important diagnostic methods are excretory urography, dye tests, cystoscopy with retrograde ureteral catheterization and ureteropyelography. Isotope methods of examination and renal echography are of major value for diagnosis of uretero-vaginal fistulas. Early in 1988 vaginography was included in the group of methods for diagnosis of urogenital fistulas."}

Following the diagnosis of primary vesicoureteric reflux, identified as part of the investigation of urinary tract infection, 299 refluxing kidneys in 202 children (aged 0-14 years) were prospectively evaluated using intravenous urography (IVU) and the DMSA renal scan at least 4 weeks after urine infection. There was 88% concordance between IVU and the DMSA scan, but in 12% there were discrepancies manifested in 37 kidneys from 31 children. Thirty-four kidneys were normal on IVU but showed scars of reflux nephropathy (RN) on the technetium 99m--dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scan; 4 of these (2 infants and 2 pre-school children) had severe generalized changes on scanning. Three kidneys were normal of DMSA scan and, although abnormal on initial IVU, were considered to be normal when this was repeated. During a follow-up period of 5 years an annual DMSA was undertaken in 194 patients and the renal scars remained unchanged in all except 1 child. The IVU was repeated 1-3 years after the initial study in 31 children in which the results of the first imaging did not agree. In 28 patients (34 kidneys) in which the initial IVU was normal but the DMSA abnormal, IVU evidence of scarring emerged in 30 of 34 kidneys, including the 4 patients with severe generalized damage on the DMSA. We conclude that abnormalities detected by the DMSA scan may precede the radiological findings, especially in young children. Even severe RN can be established in kidneys that appear normal on the IVU."}

Forty five children presenting with a first proven urinary tract infection under the age of 5 years were studied by sequential 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans. Forty nine kidneys in 40 children had definite defects at presentation, and 39 (80%) of these defects were still present when the DMSA scan was repeated. Changes in the appearance of defects were independent of the presence or degree of reflux at presentation and of symptomatic recurrence of infection, though the combination of new infection and grade 3 reflux (reflux reaching the renal calices with distension) was associated with deterioration. No kidney with a relative DMSA uptake of less than 35% showed any improvement in its cortical defects. Only two kidneys that were initially without defects, in a single patient who had bilateral grade 3 reflux and breakthrough infections, developed defects on subsequent scans. The outcome after urinary tract infection is dependent on the effect of the first infection on the kidney. Occasionally children with grade 3 reflux develop damage during subsequent infections. More widespread use of DMSA scans should improve our understanding of the factors that determine the development of renal damage."}

Investigations included early 99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan (which was performed at a median of 27 days), ultrasonography, micturating cysto-urethrography and indirect voiding radionuclide cystography using 99mTc DTPA. Follow-up DMSA scan was carried out after 6 months. Twenty-one of 102 of initial DMSA studies showed diminished uptake of radionuclide and 12 showed cortical scarring. Twenty-nine patients had significant vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The finding of diminished uptake on the initial scan was significantly associated with fever, systemic upset, length of symptoms and a peripheral blood leucocytosis, (p less than 0.05). In addition the finding was associated with fever and loin pain in the older child. Both diminished uptake and scarring were more common in refluxing kidney units. We propose that, in children with UTI, diminished uptake on early DMSA scan localises infection in the renal parenchyma."}

Five minutes following injection of Gd-DTPA, there was enhancement of the renal parenchyma in all kidneys. Excretion was seen in three pigs and no excretion in two. Thus, useful information can be obtained in partial ureteral obstruction from both pre-contrast and Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images of the kidney."}

A mixed bacterial and viral infection was documented in 19 patients (37%). Seven patients (14%) showed a diagnostic rise in antibodies to H. influenzae and 8 patients (16%) showed an antibody elevation to B. catarrhalis in their paired sera; pneumococcal antigen was detected in acute phase serum from 4 patients (8%). The rate of mixed infections in patients having respiratory symptoms was 52%. High serum C-reactive protein values and white blood cell counts were found significantly more often in those with mixed infections than in those who had viral infections. The results indicate that mixed bacterial and viral infections occur more frequently in children than one could anticipate on the basis of the earlier reports. Mixed bacterial and viral etiology is highly probable in a child who has a defined viral infection with high C-reactive protein and white blood cell count values, especially in the presence of respiratory symptoms."}

Sixty-nine children with urinary tract infection or congenital hydronephrosis aged 6 days to 13.6 years were studied. A method for determination of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the recorded curves without use of blood or urine samples was tested in 65 consecutive children. From each renogram an uptake index was determined. After a weight/height correction the sum of right and left kidney uptake index correlated with total GFR determined from plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA (ethylenediaminetetra-acetate) measured on the same day (r = 0.96). The relative standard error of estimating GFR from the renograms was 10.7% at GFR = 100 ml/min and 14.6% at GFR = 50 ml/min. In a subgroup including 20 children no difference was found in kidney morphology and length studied by renography and intravenous urography, the latter providing more details concerning the urinary tract. Relative kidney length did not correlate with relative renal function determined by renography, emphasizing the difficulty in determination of relative renal function by urography. In conclusion, not only relative but also absolute renal function (GFR) can be determined in children by 99mTc-DTPA renography; at the same time kidney and urinary tract morphology are evaluated. In our hands, 99mTc-DTPA renography has become a useful diagnostic tool, lowering the need for the more cumbersome intravenous urography and 51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance. However, intravenous urography is mandatory for the detailed study of the urinary tract, and use of the 51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance technique is necessary when a very reliable determination of GFR is wanted."}

About 50% of the images had turned positive at 30 min after injection. Except for patients with urinary tract infections, the age of the patient did not influence the speed of 111In-granulocyte accumulation; nor did the duration of disease, antibiotic therapy or degree of initial granulocyte hold-up in the lungs. High fever, on the other hand, presumably reflecting an intense inflammatory reaction, was associated with an accelerated focal 111In-granulocyte accumulation, indicating that properties of the inflammatory process per se are major determinants of the speed of accumulation of 111In-labelled granulocytes in inflammatory processes."}

To study the inflammatory response to the bacteriuric epidoses, we recorded body temperature, C-reactive protein, microsedimentation rate, urinary leukocyte count, and renal concentrating capacity. Bacterial isolates from each episode were identified and saved, and the adhesive capacity of 2669 E. coli strains was defined by their binding to galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-containing receptors. Inflammatory response was significantly higher and renal concentrating capacity significantly lower during episodes caused by attaching strains. There was a linear relation between the number of indicators of inflammation and the proportion of galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-binding strains present. Vesicoureteric reflux potentiated the inflammatory response. Attaching strains of E. coli thus appeared to be more capable of causing inflammation than were other bacteria. The potentiating effect of attachment on inflammation explains the over-representation of galactose alpha 1----4galactose beta-recognizing bacteria in patients with acute pyelonephritis."}

Infants with febrile urinary tract infection were enrolled during the same study period. The inflammatory response was characterized by the presence of fever, serum C-reactive protein, microsedimentation rate, urinary leukocyte excretion, and width of the ureters. The bacteria were defined for O:K:H serotype, hemolysin production, resistance to the bactericidal effect of serum, attachment to uroepithelial cells, and specificity for the globoseries of glycolipid receptors. In agreement with previous studies, the frequency of increased inflammatory signs and of attaching Escherichia coli was significantly higher in infants with febrile urinary tract infection than in the screening group.

Any child with urinary tract infection needs a radiologic work-up to determine his or her potential risk for sustaining renal damage. VCUG, either fluoroscopic or isotopic, should always be performed. If the infection responds to treatment and the VCUG is normal, ultrasonography should be performed. However, when the VCUG demonstrates reflux, radionuclide scan or, less preferably, excretory urography is indicated to assess renal parenchymal damage and function. When a urinary tract infection does not respond to treatment, ultrasonography or CT scan should be obtained to check for renal or perirenal abscess. If the findings are normal, medical treatment to control the infection is indicated. Further evaluation of the urinary tract may be temporarily delayed. In an infant with urinary tract infection and sepsis, renal ultrasonography is indicated. If the sonogram is normal, VCUG can be delayed until the infant responds to medical treatment. If ultrasonography is abnormal, VCUG and radionuclide scan such as 99mtechnetium DTPA with furosemide to evaluate gross morphology and function should be obtained. Complicated medical problems, such as urinary tract infection in combination with a history of intravenous drug abuse or with findings of fever and a mass, deserve immediate evaluation with ultrasonography or CT scan. A patient with fever of unknown origin and normal urine culture should have a radionuclide scan using gallium67 citrate or indium111-tagged leukocytes, both of which can demonstrate an extrarenal or unsuspected intrarenal site of infection. A variety of imaging modalities are available today for investigating urinary tract infections in the pediatric patient. Used intelligently, singly or in combination, these examinations provide information for the clinical evaluation as well as short-and long-term management of infections, their causes and complication, and their effect on renal function."}

One hundred and seventeen of these cases were found among about 40,000 consecutive routine serum IEP examinations in two laboratories during 1967-1980. Five further cases were detected during the collection of the control series. Only a few TA cases of corresponding type have been reported from elsewhere. Previous studies of some of the patients of the present series had shown that the TA phenomenon was due to complexes between albumin and IgG class autoantibodies against albumin. Clinical data were collected mainly from the hospital records. The chest radiographic findings were classified by the ILO (International Labour Office) method. The author herself examined 33 of the patients during the current disease or during the follow-up. One hundred and ten patients were followed up for a period of three months to nine years (mean 2.5 years). The patients were mostly elderly, and 93% of them were women. Most of the patients had one or more previously diagnosed chronic illnesses, for which they were receiving one or several drugs as long-term therapy. Eighty percent of the patients were receiving nitrofurantoin (NF) as prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections. However, urinary tract infection was not a current problem in any of the cases. There was evidence of a role of NF in the development of both the immunologic abnormalities and the clinical disease in the TA patients. On the basis of long-term NF treatment the patients were divided into two groups: 1) 97 patients with NF therapy (NF+ group) and 2) 25 patients without NF therapy (NF- group). The patients had mostly undergone the examinations because of cough, dyspnoea, and general symptoms (fatigue, weakness, malaise, loss of weight). The symptoms had usually started insidiously, and in 50% of the patients they had lasted for at least three months.

Renal scintigraphy represents the optimal modality for the detection of renal scars. 99mTechnetium-glucoheptonate is rapidly accumulated by the kidney through glomerular filtration and active transport by renal tubular cells. This permits rapid visualization of the renal parenchyma in the early phase (1 to 3-minute images) and subsequent imaging of the collecting system and ureters. About 10 to 15 per cent of the injected activity remains in the kidney, labeling the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules (late phase or 1 to 2-hour images). The late phase has been used more commonly to assess renal parenchymal damage. Early and late phase glucoheptonate scanning was performed in 42 children as part of the evaluation of recurrent febrile urinary tract infections with or without a history of vesicoureteral reflux. Inter-observer reliability to interpret glucoheptonate scans was good (early, 83 per cent agreement and late, 93 per cent agreement). The ability of glucoheptonate scanning to detect renal scarring in children with febrile urinary tract infections was equivalent with the early or late phase of the study. In 6 patients renal scarring was detected on only the early phase scan and in 7 scarring was detected only in the late phase. Although the detection rates are equivalent the over-all detection of scarring is improved by using both phases. Therefore, the early phase of the glucoheptonate scan may be a valuable adjunct to conventional glucoheptonate scan methodology used for the detection of renal scarring in children with recurrent urinary tract infections."}

Bilateral parenchymal involvement of the kidneys by this chronic granulomatous disease has not previously been reported in infancy and is fatal if untreated.

At the other extreme are abdominal abscesses, which may defy clinical diagnosis, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and may remain undetected or insufficiently characterized in spite of multiple imaging studies.

Yet, the IVP has a very limited value with only about 25% of children with pyelonephritis demonstrating abnormalities. Ultrasound (US) has recently been advocated as a replacement for the poorly sensitive and poorly specific IVP. However, comparative studies between US and IVP indicate only an equivalent sensitivity and specificity. Cortical scintigraphy with Technetium-99m glucoheptonate (99mTc GH) or 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc DMSA) has also been advocated as a means of differentiating parenchymal (pyelonephritis) from nonparenchymal (lower UTI) involvement in UTI. The clinical presentation may be misleading especially in the infant and child in whom an elevated temperature, flank pain, shaking chills, or an elevated sedimentation rate are often lacking. The clinician attempts to localize the site of infection for it has a direct bearing upon the therapy. A collecting system infection can often be eradicated with a single oral dose of an appropriate antibiotic, whereas renal parenchymal involvement requires IV therapy for an extended interval. Cortical scintigraphy can localize the site of infection with a high degree of accuracy. Recent studies report a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 81% of pyelonephritis. This is in contrast to the IVP with a sensitivity of only 24% and US with a sensitivity of only 42%. The scintigraphic appearance of parenchymal infection of the kidney is a spectrum of minimal to gross defects reflecting the degree of histologic involvement that spans from a mild infection to frank abscess. Cortical scintigraphy can be used to monitor the evolution of scarring following infection. Cortical scintigraphy with 99mTc DMSA or 99mTc GH is the method of choice for the initial evaluation of UTI. Not only does it have a very high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating parenchymal from collecting system disease, but it also provides an accurate quantitative measurement of function and in combination with radioiodinated orthoiodohippurate renography and Lasix (furosemide; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago) diuresis will also differentiate significant obstruction from stasis. The use of radionuclide techniques opens new vistas for the investigation of UTI. Cortical scintigraphy should become the gold standard by which other technologies, therapy, and theoretical considerations of pyelonephritis are measured."}

A 38-year-old woman presented with fever, right flank pain, and a clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis. Work-up revealed the presence of a crossing arterial branch causing obstruction of the superior infundibulum of the right kidney, which is an uncommon cause of nephralgia and urinary infection initially described by Fraley in 1966. Intravenous urography, retrograde pyelography, and angiography remain the mainstay of diagnosis, much as in the initial descriptions of this entity. [131I]Hippuran imaging, with analysis of the upper and lower pole regions of interest, provides a simple yet powerful method of evaluating functional and excretory changes in the superior infundibulum, and has proved more efficacious than previously reported whole-kidney renograms. Renal scintigraphy represents a relatively noninvasive method of serial functional examination in this disorder. Ultrasound imaging, by monitoring upper-pole dilatation, may provide complementary morphologic information important for long-term follow-up."}

None of these boys referred to a history of a known urological anomaly, urinary tract infection, haematuria, palpable mass in the renal region, bladder extrophy, epispadias, hypospadias or anorectal malformation. On the third day after orchiopexy and intravenous pyelography was done in every boy following testicular protection against irradiation. Ultrasonic investigation was not available at that time. There were minor urological abnormalities in 36 (25%) boys and major ones in 8 (5.5%) boys. A major anomaly is defined as one resulting in significant loss of renal substance (one case of single kidney and three cases of unilateral renal hypoplasia), or requiring surgical correction for conservation of the renal substance (one case of ureterocele, two cases of pelviureteric stenosis and one case of vesicoureteric stenosis with ipsilateral hydronephrosis). The unsuspected major urological abnormalities are usually ipsilateral to the more undescended testis. They may be associated with a hernia and are more frequent in bilateral cryptorchidism. In conclusion we encourage the routine use of IVP, or ultrasonic investigation or dynamic renal scanning (99mTc-DTPA), if it is possible, in all patients undergoing orchiopexy for the detection of an unsuspected major renal anomaly."}

Renal cortical defects were detected in 65 kidneys by DMSA scan, intravenous urogram, and ultrasound scan combined; 62 (95%) being seen on DMSA scan. The finding of reflux on micturating cystourethrography showed a highly significant correlation with renal defects seen on DMSA scanning, a less close but still significant correlation with abnormalities on intravenous urography, but none with ultrasound scan findings. The sensitivity of the DMSA scan in screening for all grades of reflux is estimated as 0.66, which is higher than that previously reported for the intravenous urogram or ultrasound scan. DMSA scans were less likely to miss grade 3 reflux than the other two methods. DMSA scans are more useful than other upper renal tract imaging techniques in detecting renal defects. Consideration should be given to their use as a first investigation in place of routine intravenous urograms. Ultrasound scans alone will overlook potentially serious urinary tract abnormalities."}

There was no recent history of infection. Vesicoureteric reflux had been present in 48 patients and had stopped in 23 at the time of the DMSA scan. In six of the 72 radiologically scarred kidneys, the DMSA scan appeared normal but scarring would have been overlooked in only two of the 54 patients. DMSA scan changes are non-specific and underestimated individual scars in 21 kidneys. The intravenous urogram and the DMSA scan showed good correlation but should be regarded as complementary investigations in these patients, giving morphological and functional information, respectively. On DMSA scans the timing of any preceding urinary tract infection must be considered in order to differentiate diffuse potentially reversible defects in isotope uptake after urinary tract infection from those due to permanent renal scarring."}

To create pyelonephritis vesicoureteral reflux of infected urine was surgically induced in 22 piglets. Nine animals were evaluated with a dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan at 1 week and 13 at 2 weeks. Autopsy and histopathological examination of the kidneys were performed subsequently. The location and extent of the inflammatory response found on histopathological examination were compared to dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings in a blinded fashion. Of the 22 kidneys subjected to vesicoureteral reflux 15 had positive histopathological findings of acute pyelonephritis, including 13 detected by the dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings. The 2 kidneys in which inflammation was not detected had only minimal grade I lesions and were grossly normal. There were no false positive scans in any of these kidneys. The sensitivity of the scan for detection of acute pyelonephritis in the kidneys subjected to reflux was 87 per cent and the specificity was 100 per cent. Furthermore, in these same kidneys the dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan findings correctly predicted the presence or absence of individual pyelonephritic lesions in 62 of 66 poles for an over-all agreement rate of 94 per cent. Thus, dimercapto-succinic acid renal cortical imaging is a highly sensitive and reliable imaging modality to detect and localize experimental acute pyelonephritis in piglets."}

Conflicting opinions exist concerning the use of various birth control methods for women suffering from kidney diseases. Some researchers think kidney diseases are a contraindication for the use of IUD; since IUDs may cause inflammatory processes; others think that preventive therapy of extragenital diseases may make the use of IUD possible. The article studies the functional condition of the urinary system and various hormone levels (renin, aldosterone, vasopressin, cortisol) in women using an IUD. The selections of hormones was based on their role in regulating the water-salt exchange before disturbed in pathologic kidney patients. 43 women aged 19-30 were monitored before insertion and 6 months after insertion of an IUD. 20 women suffered from chronic pyelonephritis, 13 from a latent form of chronic glomerulonephritis; the control group consisted of 10 healthy women. All had previously borne children or had an induced abortion. Besides radioisotopic and radio-immunologic testing, such clinical indicators as bilirubin concentration, cholesterol, and urea in the blood, were determined. Some dependencies were found: for chronic pyelonephritis a positive correlation between the concentration of vasopressin and aldosterone, vasopressin and cortisol, and cortisol and the amount of leukocytes; for chronic glomerulonephritis, a positive correlation between aldosterone concentration and arterial pressure, cortisone level and amount of protein in the urine and concentration of vasopressin and amount of erythrocytes in the urine. The reaction of the kidneys to IUD-induced aseptic inflammatory processes in the uterus is more pronounced for healthy women and women suffering form chronic pyelonephritis, than for women with latent chronic glomerulonephritis, as demonstrated in the test by a reduction in cortisol concentration. The minor changes of the renal functions noticed in healthy and, to a somewhat larger degree, in women from chronic pyelonephritis do not constitute a contraindication for IUD usage and, for latent forms of chronic glomerulonephritis, the IUD is preferred. The functional condition of the kidneys of women suffering from chronic pyelonephritis who use an IUD should be tested by using dynamic scintigraphy."}

These children could be followed up on the average 8.5 or 3 years after the operation, clinically, roentgenologically and in some cases via scintigraphy. Late complications requiring surgical correction, such as stomatostenoses, conduit elongation, stenoses of the ureterointestinal anastomosis, calculus formation in the conduit, or complications like ureteral reflux, recurring infections of the urinary passages with pyelonephritis, occurred only with ileal conduits, whereas no late complications requiring surgery were seen with the colonic conduits. Similar results in respect of late complications were found among the patients in Munich from 1955 to 1983 with 35 exstrophies of the bladder (13 ileal conduits, 1 colonic conduit) in which additionally an adeno-carcinoma was seen after ureterosigmoideostomy with fatal outcome. Hence, we are of the opinion that the method of choice is the preparation of a colonic conduit in patients with exstrophy of the bladder where primary closure is not possible because the bladder lamina is too small or already epithelialised. This approach offers the safest possible long-term protection of the primary normally positioned upper urinary tract."}

A total of 545 serial serum CRP concentrations were determined. In group 1, CRP concentrations were below the detection limit of the method (10 mg/L) except in one neonate who suffered from neonatal anoxia but whose clinical course was uncomplicated (CRP: 31 mg/L within 24 h of life). Thirty-three neonates of group 2 had CRP values consistently below 10 mg/L while 16 had elevated CRP concentrations at least on one occasion ranging from 10 to 70 mg/L. Diagnoses other than bacterial infection could explain the raised CRP concentrations in neonates of group 2. CRP concentrations were found to be elevated (greater than 80 mg/L) during the course of infectious diseases in all neonates with proven bacterial infection (septicemia (4), pneumonia (1), multiple micro-abscesses (1), urinary tract infection (3]. Serial measurement of CRP concentrations are shown to be valuable in detecting bacterial infection in neonates as well as in following the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy."}

The superiority of either a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein as a generic, global screening test for bacterial infection in infants or children has not been clearly demonstrated. The few claims of superiority for one determination over another relate more to the clinical setting than marginal differences in sensitivity or specificity. Neither the complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein has proved sensitive enough of predicting invasive bacterial infection that it can be used as an isolated measure upon which major management decisions can safely be based. Several investigators have therefore addressed whether these tests can complement each other. Unfortunately, acquisition of multiple nonspecific laboratory tests in a given clinical situation may yield widely divergent results. The C-reactive protein, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and zeta sedimentation ratio are all comparably priced in the $15.00 to $30.00 range. However, if multiple tests are obtained, the cost of this approach may become unacceptably high. Current practice advocates a careful evaluation of an ill pediatric patient in an Emergency setting. The initial clinical impression of an experienced clinician based on history and physical examination frequently provides dependable information with which to direct subsequent evaluation. If bacterial infection ranks high on the differential list, relevant laboratory studies should be considered. Observation of quantitative and qualitative changes of the hematologic profile or rate of erythrocyte sedimentation are adequate tools in specific circumstances. With the resurgence of interest in the use of C-reactive protein, it too may join the ranks of convention in selected settings."}

The photon deficiency of the hemithorax on Tc-99m HMDP bone scintigraphy was shown in a case of massive pleural effusion, which was proved by autopsy to be due to metastatic breast carcinoma in the pleura. Two factors caused these scintigraphic findings: 1) a large amount of fluid in the pleural cavity caused photon attenuation; 2) the higher body background in the noninvolved hemithorax and other areas of the body was due to renal dysfunction resulting from chronic pyelonephritis. Whether the accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical agent in the pleural effusion was malignant or benign could not readily be distinguished."}

Scintigraphy serves as a reliable criterion for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy in patients with chronic pyelonephritis (CP). Changes of scintigraphy parameters coincide quite exactly with the changed level of arterial pressure, concentration and nitrogen clearing function of the kidneys during treatment. This method (sectoral scintigraphy) is very important when used over time in CP patients with chronic renal insufficiency making it possible to detect with a sufficient degree of significance the improvement as well as impairment of renal function which is a crucial point for the choice of further therapeutic tactics."}

Eleven children with treatable problems were identified, 10 with vesicoureteral reflux and 1 with a ureterocele.

Since sepsis is the most frequent single cause of death after surgery and trauma, its development should be anticipated in elderly patients or those with disease or trauma causing intestinal leaks, particularly if the patient had massive transfusions or was in shock. Diagnosis may be extremely difficult, particularly if the infection is intraperitoneal. Furthermore, patients with impaired host defenses may show only a failure to thrive and then a progressive MOF. Physical examination is usually not very helpful. Gallium and indium scans and ultrasonography are only about 50 to 60 per cent accurate. Ultrasonography followed by HIDA and PIPIDA scans may be very useful in diagnosing acute acalculous cholecystitis, which appears to be an increasingly frequent problem in these patients. Computerized tomographic scans are at least 80 to 90 per cent accurate in diagnosing intra-abdominal abscesses, but the diagnosis of peritonitis is still largely clinically based. Even without clear evidence of infection, the critically ill patient with MOF and previous abdominal trauma, surgery, or disease should probably have the abdomen explored (that is, a blind laparotomy). If generalized peritonitis is found, it may be wise to leave the abdomen open and re-explore and d\u00e9bride it daily until it is clean. Percutaneous drainage of abdominal abscesses is being performed increasingly and is of special value in the 30 to 50 per cent of patients with single bacterial abscesses in which the drainage tract does not cross bowel or peritoneum and there is no underlying intestinal leak. Antibiotics are only a second line of defense, and their use should be directed by smear and culture results when possible. For abdominal infections, coverage for gram-negative anaerobes and Bacteroides fragilis is essential. If the infection persists for more than 2 to 3 weeks, infection by enterococci and fungi must be considered. If shock develops, maintaining an O2 consumption of at least 130 to 160 ml per minute per m2 is a particularly important part of the resuscitation. Although controversial, raising the hematocrit to 40 to 45 per cent or higher is often of value."}

Acute cholecystitis is a non-rare disease, the incidence of which was increasing in the last years parallel to biliary lithiasis, which in 90% of cases is the first cause of such pathology. From the anatomopathological standpoint, we distinguish three types of acute cholecystitis: catarrhal, suppurative and gangrenous. The most frequently remarked symptom is ache at right hypochondrium. Only in 30% of cases cholecyst can be palpated, in form of ovoid mass; typical is the positiveness of Murphy's manoeuvre; constant is fever, but not subicterus. The introduction of new methods of ascertainment, exempt from any risks, simple to be performed and remarkably careful, made the diagnostics of acute cholecystites easier: parietal cholecystotomography, hepato-biliary scintigraphy, echotomography (first approach investigation), computerized axial tomography and laparoscopy almost always succeed in dispelling doubts. By using more than one of these investigations, a diagnostic accuracy, touching on 100%, can be reached. The differential diagnosis should be placed with: peptic ulcer, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, gonococcus perihepatitis, virus hepatitis, acute pyelonephritis, right basal pneumonia. The complications an acute cholecystitis can occur are: perforation (localized, in free peritoneum or in a hollow organ), choleperitonaeum, necrosis of hepatic parenchyma, acute pancreatitis. Due to the possible arising of such complications, the mortality unfortunately is not indifferent (5%), especially in patients already weakened by other chronic diseases. Still discussed is the question as to when performing operation. In fact, there are three trends: intervention in immediate emergency, in postponed emergency, or in remote time (preceded by a medical treatment). The Authors prefer the intervention in postponed emergency, as, in their experience, they remarked the poor effectiveness of the delay medical treatment, also involving a greater difficulty in the technical execution of the intervention and a longer stay in hospital. From 1973 up to 1983, 241 cases of acute cholecystitis (158 women and 83 men) were hospitalized at the First Aid Surgical Centre of the Catania University. Eight patients refused the surgical intervention. The remaining 233 underwent, depending upon the seriousness of the affection, the associated diseases and the different reactiveness to the medical treatment, operation: in immediate emergency (26.1%); in postponed emergency (67.8%; in remote time (6.1%). The mortality was 2.2%, with the lowest percentage in the second group."}

Between the ages of 2 and 6 weeks, 22 piglets received subcutaneous injections of formalin-killed Escherichia coli in incomplete Freund's adjuvant as described. The remaining 22 piglets received incomplete Freund's adjuvant and vehicle alone. The antibody responses to antigenic challenge were weak to moderate. Immunized animals tended to have less renal scarring and better renal tubular uptake of dimercaptosuccinic acid, in addition to significantly lower serum creatinine values (p less than 0.001) and less mesangial cell proliferation in glomeruli (p = 0.05). We conclude that previous exposure to a specific bacterial strain and bacterial immunization have at least a mild protective effect on the development of reflux nephropathy."}

Highly satisfactory renal scans were obtained in all patients. In 20 patients with renal failure (serum creatinine 1.8-8.5 mg/dl, mean 4.7) a comparison was made of the renal scans obtained with 99mTc-Ap and with 99mTc-DMSA. 99mTc-Ap was slightly better than 99mTc-DMSA, especially in patients with far advanced renal failure. Some aspects of the pharmacokinetics of 99mTc-Ap were studied in 72 cases. In 22 of these patients plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap was determined by the single injection method using a two-compartment model. In patients with GFR greater than 90 ml/min plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap was 67.6 +/- 8.4 SD ml/min. A good correlation was observed between plasma clearance of 99mTc-Ap and GFR (r = 0.74). After IV injection 99mTc-Ap was stably fixed by the kidney. Renal radioactivity remained stable between the second and eighth hour after the injection. Urinary excretion of radioactivity measured in 35 patients in the first and in the second 2-h interval after IV injection of 99mTc-Ap was negligible in all patients (2.7 +/- 1.5 SD percent of the dose in the first 2 h; 2.8 +/- 1.4 SD between the second and fourth hour). 99mTc-Ap is an excellent agent for renal imaging.

A high level of diagnostic accuracy was obtained with studies of antibody coating of urinary bacteria by immunofluorescence, 131iodine hippuran quantitative scintillation camera studies with the patient in the hydropenic state and 67gallium citrate scintiphotos. We identified unique patterns that differentiated cystitis, ureteritis, pyelonephritis and renal or perinephric abscess. Herein we review our clinical experience with these combined techniques in 40 patients and correlate the degree of accuracy of these studies with that of standard radiographic examinations. In 20 patients diagnostic studies also were compared to the findings of split ureteral urine cultures or bacteriologic culture of renal tissue obtained from surgical specimens or autopsy. The use of the quantitative scintillation camera studies done with the patient in a state of controlled hydropenia increased clearly the level of diagnostic sensitivity in demonstrating the source of a urinary tract infection compared to urine culture and excretory urography alone. In patients with an abnormal 131iodine hippuran study the performance of 67gallium renal imaging on the same day usually provided information that allowed specific localization of the source and extent of an infection. Both studies must be performed with a high degree of resolution over the renal areas and then must be interpreted carefully to ensure accuracy. Study of antibody coating of urinary bacteria was helpful in suggesting the presence or absence of upper urinary tract disease but was less sensitive and accurate than the combined radionuclide studies."}

In girls, the incident which reveals the diagnosis is most often an infection and in boys, it is pain or haematuria. 26% of the cases had an associated urological lesion (23 cases of vesico-ureteric reflux, 8 cases of renal stones, 5 cases of mega-ureter and 4 cases of horseshoe kidney). 133 children were operated, essentially by resection of the pyelo-ureteric junction with an upstream by-pass. From the 126 cases with sufficient follow-up, 48 (38.1%) obtained great improvement, 63 (50%) a moderate improvement and 15 (11.9%), a stabilisation of the dilatation. In all cases except 3, the pyelo-ureteric junction was perfectly catheterizable. The histological lesions of the junction were variable and difficult to systematise, but usually extended beyond the junction to involve a large part of the pelvis. The variability of the caliceal dilatation makes any attempt at classification difficult. The authors recommend cystography in every case, as associated reflux was discovered in 16% of cases. Retrograde uretero-pyelography is practically no longer indicated. The isotope kidney scan with DTPA technetium, with a hyper-diuresis test, is often used, as it gives an idea about the clearance of filtration and about the degree of obstruction. Quantitative DMSA kidney scan can reveal the effects on the renal parenchyma. Conservation of the isthmus of a horseshoe kidney never interferes with the uretero-pyelic re-implantation. After correction of the anomaly of the uretero-pyelic junction, 5 cases of unilateral reflux out of 8 and 3 cases of bilateral reflux out of 10 resolved spontaneously."}

Differentiation between upper and lower tract infections (UTI) was based on clinical grounds and on elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and fever. NAG excretion expressed as nmol X h-1 X mg-1 of urinary creatinine was higher in children with upper UTI (mean +/- SE 906 +/- 236) than in those with lower UTI (145 +/- 23) or healthy children (151.6 +/- 10) (p less than 0.01 by Duncan's test). In children with upper UTI, NAG excretion fell in parallel with the remission due to antibiotic treatment. This however was not seen in children treated with aminoglycosides.

The percentage of B isoenzyme excreted was high in two children with upper UTI but was low total NAG urinary excretion, suggesting that the quantification of isoenzymes offers further specificity in diagnosis.

The concentrations of TMP-SD in urine were invariably more than 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for the causative organisms (tested at the ratios 1:20 and 1:4 of TMP and SD). Non-metabolized SD constituted 77% of total SD in urine of infants, and 55% of total SD in children of 1 year or more. The TMP-SD combination showed a satisfactory clinical effect and favourable pharmacokinetic properties in children with UTI."}

Total hip replacement was performed in either one or two stages in thirty-three hips with active sepsis. The sepsis had followed hemiarthroplasty in six hips, open reduction with internal fixation of a fracture in eight, cup arthroplasty in one, and total hip replacement in eight hips within six years prior to the second total hip replacement. Ten additional patients had total hip replacement following destruction of the hip joint by hematogenous sepsis in nine and by infection following a shrapnel wound in one. Of these thirty-three patients, twenty-three (70 per cent) reveal no signs of infection at three to nine years after prosthetic replacement. Of the remaining ten in whom an infection developed, six had definite recurrences of the original infection, three were infected with organisms different from the original one, and one was either a local recurrence or reseeding from a persistent pyelonephritis. The success rate when the original organism was gram-positive was 78 per cent, including two of three total hip replacements done in the presence of active infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis. The success with gram-negative organisms, however, was only 58 per cent. The prosthetic failure rate was highest in patients who had had a previous infection about a total hip replacement (37 per cent) and in patients who had had a previous infection but no prior prosthetic or internal fixation devices (37 per cent). The lowest prosthetic failure rates were in patients with an infected hemiarthroplasty (16 per cent), an infection around an internal fixation device (25 per cent), or an infected cup arthroplasty. A complete and differential blood-cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, aspiration arthrogram, and radiographs did not effectively predict success or failure. For gram-positive infections, the success rates were similar following either a one or a two-stage procedure. We found that the success rates could be improved by a repeat course of parenteral antibiotics after the total hip replacement even if all preoperative and intraoperative studies failed to identify an infection. Patients with a successful total hip replacement achieved much better functional results than those who had to have a Girdlestone procedure. However, all patients must be carefully assessed prior to reimplantation of a prosthesis because of the high failure rate, especially with gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas having the gravest prognosis), even when the procedure is done in two stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}

Because of the unreliability of patient compliance with prescribed medications and because single-dose aminoglycoside therapy has been shown to be effective in women with cystitis, we assessed the efficacy of single-dose amikacin for treatment of first episodes of Escherichia coli lower urinary tract infection in girls. Upper and lower urinary tract infections were presumptively differentiated by simple criteria such as clinical symptoms, fever, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Fifty-four girls (ages 1 to 12 years) with two positive urine cultures (greater than 10(5) CFU/ml E. coli) were assigned by a table of random numbers to receive treatment with either sulfisoxazole 150 mg/kg/day orally for 10 days or a single dose of amikacin 7.5 mg/kg intramuscularly. Six of 23 patients (26%) in the amikacin group and four of 21 (19%) in the sulfisoxazole group had at least one positive urine culture within 40 days after completion of therapy. This difference was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.5). This suggests that a single dose of amikacin is as effective as a 10-day course of sulfisoxazole in the treatment of presumed first lower urinary tract infection in girls. Additional potential advantages of single-dose therapy are fewer side effects and less toxicity, excellent compliance, and reduced potential for selecting resistant organisms."}

Urine total lactic dehydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes, and serum C-reactive protein have been useful to distinguish pyelonephritis from cystitis in patients with intact urinary tracts. We used these tests in patients with ileal conduits who had urine containing more and less than 10(5) organisms per ml. All patients had elevated urine total lactic dehydrogenase-5 isoenzyme, and serum C-reactive protein. No statistically significant difference in any of these parameters existed between the groups.

In addition, the Nuclear Medicine study is well suited to the evaluation of obstruction where serial studies often are required because of a lower radiation burden compared to urography. This lower radiation dose is especially important in obstruction because of the recurrent nature of several kinds of obstructive uropathy and because of the high incidence in the pediatric age group. The ability to control urine flow rate during the procedure through dehydration or administration of diuretics is an additional benefit.

Patients with acute pyelonephritis may present with a spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms. There are few noninvasive diagnostic studies, however, to confirm or exclude this diagnosis. A small number of patients, generally those with severe disease, will demonstrate radiographic changes on excretory urography, but the lack of sensitivity of the IVP in early, acute pyelonephritis is well documented. Several radionuclide techniques have been proposed to assist in the earlier detection of this clinical problem including imaging with Mercury-197 chlormerodrin, Gallium-67 citrate, Technetium-99m glucoheptonate. Technetium-99m DMSA, and, more recently, Indium-111 labeled white blood cells. The success of the renal cortical imaging agents as well as those which localize in infection are described in this report. There appears to be a complimentary role or the cortical imaging agents and the radiopharmaceuticals which localize in bacterial infection. Cortical agents offer the advantage of specific assessment of functioning renal tissue and a convenient, rapid method for following the response to treatment in a noninvasive manner. A pattern is described which may be diagnostic; correlation with Gallium-67 citrate of Indium-111 WBCs may increase the probability of infection as the cause for the cortical abnormality. The measurement of differential renal function using cortical agents provides additional information to assist the clinician in predicting the late effects of infection.

The diagnostic work-up of the urologic patient must be tailored to the presenting symptom complex, carefully selecting from the many modilities available, those most likely to establish the diagnosis and extent of the suspected lesions. Intravenous urography is the most rewarding initial procedure for many presenting symptoms, including suspected masses, pyuria, hematuria, and flank pain. Nuclear imaging is particularly effective in differentiating renal lobulations from true masses, in demonstrating parenchymal scarring in chronic pyelonephritis when the IVP is equivocal, and in assessing the decrease in perfusion and function in obstructive nephropathy when the IVP is indeterminate. It is the preferred procedure for acute renal infarction and acute tubular necrosis and has a greater sensitivity of detection for renal trauma than the IVP. Gallium-67 renal imaging appear helpful in the detection of occult pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis. However, it cannot differentiate focal acute pyelonephritis from abscess or abscess from neoplasm. Ultrasoneography is the initial procedure of choice in the differentiation of cystic from solid renal masses and in anuria or oliguria. When a kidney fails to visualize by IVP or nuclear imaging, it can confirm or rule out obstruction. In upper tract infections, it may demonstrate renal or perirenal abscess. Although retrograde pyelography is performed less frequently in recent years, it remains extremely useful in confirming and relieving obstructive uropathy and in delineating tumors of the collecting system. Computed tomography effectively demonstrates hydronephrosis, renal abscess, tumors, and cysts and retroperitoneal involvement. More experience is needed to judge the efficiency of \"dynamic\" CT for the quantification of renal function.

Parenchymal function, measured by renography, was reduced in 2 hydronephrotic kidneys and both patients had had upper urinary tract infections. The ability to concentrate urine was impaired in 10 hydronephrotic kidneys. These patients had renal calculi or had had upper urinary tract infections. The urinary beta-2-microglobulin excretion was normal in all hydronephrotic kidneys, indicating an intact proximal tubular function in these patients."}

Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was studied in a group of 48 children with urinary tract infections (UTI) using a whole blood micromethod for lymphocyte stimulation in vitro. The patients were subdivided into pyelonephritis group (27 cases) and lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) group (21 cases) on the basis of fever, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reative protein and renal concentration capacity. At the acute stage of infection the lymphocyte responsiveness to leucoagglutinin (LA) and concanavalin A (Con A) was suppressed in both groups, but the suppression was much greater in those with pyelonephritis. By 6 weeks after infection the lymphocyte responses were normal in most but not all cases. We conclude that an acute pyelonephritis is associated with marked suppression of CMI and that the latter can be used as an additional criterion for establishing the level of infection. Patients with UTI did not generally appear to have any primary defect of CMI but when suppression of CMI was present, it seemed secondary to an ongoing infection."}

We propose a simplified routine procedure with scintiphotos taken 10-15 min after injection for topographic information and 120 min after injection for renal morphology. This procedure allows excellent case finding of diffuse parenchymal disease of a special value in cases of radiological non-visualization. The technique is indicated, when iodine contrast media cannot be used for radiological examinations. DMSA studies, however, do not allow safe functional evaluation in all categories of patients. Neither can obstructive nephropathy be diagnosed unless the renal pelvis is dilated. Renal perfusion studies are contaminated by the perfusion of liver and spleen. Nevertheless, a tentative differentiation between cysts and tumours is possible, the former being hypoperfused the latter hyperperfused.

A method for quantitative estimation of split renal function using a computerized gamma camera system is described. 42 children and adolescents with existing or preexisting vesicoureteric reflux and recurrent urinary tract infection were investigated. Total renal clearance of DTPA was calculated with a disappearance curve derived from the largest extrarenal area in the field of view of a gamma camera with diverging collimator. Split renal function was estimated with the slopes of second phase renograms. The plasma disappearance clearance of DTPA, calculated using one compartment model with two late blood samples, gave similar results with the clearance estimated from the body disappearance curves. The proportional planimetric renal parenchymal areas had good correlation with the split clearance estimated from renogram slopes. The method offers data on renal function and urinary tract dynamics which is very valuable in the follow-up of children with recurrent urinary tract infection and vesicoureteric reflux."}

Triple-probe renography, using computer assisted blood background subtraction, provides another reliable indicator of relative function, which is considerably more accurate than conventional dual-probe renography. Relative renal function also may be determined, but with less precision, from the relative counts in a rectilinear kidney scan, from the relative scan areas and from the relative areas found on excretory urography.

In addition, by comparing the clearance rate of the two radiocompounds one can also obtain some interesting diagnostic information which can contribute usefully to the interpretation of renographic tracings and/or gamma camera sequential images."}

However, (67)Ga renal uptake is not present in patients with radiographic evidence of chronic pyelonephritis without active infection and in patients without renal disease."}

Detection and localization of an enterovesicular fistula in a patient with chronic inflammatory bowel disease and recurrent urinary tract infection was accomplished by following a bolus of orally administered gold colloid as it traversed the gastrointestinal tract with serial scintiphotos and simultaneously monitoring the activity in the urine. When significant tracer was found in the urine, multiple scans of the abdomen were obtained to determine the location of the tracer. To confirm the site of the fistula, the tracer was mixed with barium and administered per rectum. Radiographs were obtained when significant activity was found in the urine. At surgery, bowel in the region of the cecum was adherent to the bladder, but no fistula was demonstrable by methylene blue instillation into the bladder. Postoperatively, the urinary tract infection cleared, and re-examination with oral Au198 colloid revealed no activity in the urine. The radiation dose to the gonads from this peocedure is 42 mrads. The procedure is safe, simple to perform, well tolerated, and permits an answer to the question of whether a fistula i present, and where it is located."}

The means of the diastolic blood pressures, serum ureas, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were significantly higher in the bacteriuric group, and acquired renal abnormalities were demonstrated in 18% of the bacteriuric women as compared with 4% of the controls. It is concluded that screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the adult non-pregnant female population in many instances fails to detect urinary tract infection at an early and reversible stage."}

Treatment was with one of three antimonial compounds given at equivalent metallic dosage daily.Antimony sodium tartrate (AST) and antimony dimercaptosuccinate (TWSb) were equally efficient curatively but both produced many side-effects. Sodium antimonylgluconate (TSAG) was four-fifths as effective but tolerance was superior. Estimations of urinary antimony excretion showed that tissue retention of the metal was related to cure-rates and side-effects. It was concluded that none of the drugs were suitable for mass chemotherapy.More new non-toxic schistosomicides are urgently needed and for their assessment, the setting-up of multicentre trials, following international agreement on technical methods, is suggested."}
