KISS1 is a metastasis suppressor lost in several solid malignancies. We evaluated the clinical relevance of KiSS-1 methylation and its protein expression in colorectal cancer. The epigenetic silencing of KiSS-1 by hypermethylation was tested in colon cancer cells (n\u2009=\u20095) before and after azacytidine treatment. KiSS-1 methylation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR in colorectal cancer cells, and normal, benign, and tumor tissues (n\u2009=\u2009352) were grouped in a training set (n\u2009=\u200962) and two independent validation cohorts (n\u2009=\u2009100 and n\u2009=\u2009190). KiSS-1 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on tissue arrays. KiSS-1 hypermethylation correlated with transcript and protein expression loss, being increased in vitro by azacytidine. Methylation rates were 53.1, 70.0, and 80.0\u00a0% in the training and validation sets, respectively. In the training set, KiSS-1 methylation rendered a diagnostic accuracy of 72.7\u00a0% (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Combination of KiSS-1 methylation and serum CEA (p\u2009=\u20090.001) increased the prognostic utility of CEA alone (p\u2009=\u20090.022). In the first validation set, KiSS-1 methylation correlated with tumor grade (p\u2009=\u20090.011), predicted recurrence (p\u2009=\u20090.009), metastasis (p\u2009=\u20090.004), disease-free (p\u2009=\u20090.034), and overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.015). In the second validation cohort, KiSS-1 methylation predicted disease-specific survival (p\u2009=\u20090.030). In the training set, cytoplasmic KiSS-1 expression was significantly higher in nonneoplastic biopsies as compared to colorectal tumors (p\u2009<\u20090.0005). In the validation set, loss of cytoplasmic expression correlated with tumor stage (p\u2009=\u20090.007), grade (p\u2009=\u20090.035), recurrence (p\u2009=\u20090.017), and disease-specific survival (p\u2009=\u20090.022). KiSS-1 was revealed epigenetically modified in colorectal cancer. The diagnostic and prognostic utility of KiSS-1 methylation and expression patterns suggests their assessment for the clinical management of colorectal cancer patients."}

Guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) is expressed exclusively in normal intestinal mucosal cells, primary and metastatic colorectal cancers (CRC). The aim of this study was to determine the possible association between the GCC expressions in peripheral blood, prognostic parameters and response to chemotherapy in CRC patients. Fourty-nine metastatic CRC patients and 41 healthy controls with similar age and sex were included to this study. Peripheral blood GCC expressions are measured by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Interstingly, no GCC expression was measured in healthy controls but GCC expressions of the patients were detectable. Although there was a significant reduction in GCC expressions in 30 patients with regression (from 5.46\u2009\u00b1\u20094.12 to 0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), marked increase in GCC expressions was observed in 19 patients with progression following chemotherapy (from 0.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19 to 1.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52, p\u2009=\u20090.0174). Significant correlation was found between the GCC expressions and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels (p\u2009=\u20090.0041) in 30 patients with regression before chemotherapy. Marked correlation was also detected between the GCC expressions and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (p\u2009=\u20090.0072) in 19 patients with progression before chemotherapy. The results of the present study suggest that peripheral blood GCC expressions along with CEA and CA19-9 can be used to determine the early respose to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC. These findings imply that higher expression of GCC in peripheral blood seems to be an indicator of good therapeutic response to chemotherapy and remission. Monitoring the peripheral blood GCC expressions may allow employing different treatment options to metastatic CRC patients."}

Nowadays we know that survival rates do not differ between repeated and single liver resections for colorectal liver metastases (CLM). To be able to determine patients prone to early recurrence, the use of different markers with a better prognostic value than the routinely employed tumor markers is required. The aim of our study was to assess mRNA expression of MMP-7, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and CEA in tissue samples from CLM and their relationship to disease-free interval (DFI) and overall survival (OS). The liver tumor biopsies were obtained from 40 patients suffering from CLM treated with radical surgery. mRNA expression levels of CEA, MMPs and TIMPs and a housekeeping gene (GAPDH) were quantified using RT-PCR. The increased expression of CEA, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in CLM was associated with a short DFI and a high tendency to early CLM recurrence. Statistical analysis confirmed CEA, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression as prognostic factors of survival. This study demonstrated the importance of CEA, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the prognostication of DFI and OS."}

Apoptotic markers and tumor-associated antigens might be suitable to indicate the response to radiochemotherapy early. We analyzed the courses of nucleosomes, CEA, CA 19-9 and CYFRA 21-1 in 25 colorectal cancer patients during radiochemotherapy (4 postoperative, 13 preoperative, 8 local relapse therapy). Blood was taken before therapy, daily during the first week, once weekly during the following weeks, and at the end of the radiochemotherapy. After a temporary decline 6 h after the first irradiation, nucleosomes rose in most patients rapidly reaching a maximum during the first days which was followed by a subsequent decrease. In patients receiving postoperative therapy after complete resection of tumor, nucleosome levels generally were lower than in patients with preoperative or relapse therapy. Correspondingly, CEA, CA 19-9 and CYFRA 21-1 levels of postoperatively treated patients were the lowest whereas those with tumor relapse had the highest ones. During preoperative therapy, lower nucleosome concentrations were found in patients with response to therapy resulting in a smaller area under the curve of days 1-3 (AUC) than in those with progressive disease (p = 0.028). The other parameters did not indicate the response to therapy at the initial treatment phase. In conclusion, the course of nucleosomes (AUC) might be valuable for the early prediction of therapy response in preoperatively treated colorectal cancer patients."}

The purpose of this study was to compare the utility of serum CEA, CA 19-9, CA 242, CA 72-4 and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)beta in the follow-up of 102 surgically treated colorectal cancer patients, out of which 40 patients developed clinical recurrence. In patients with recurrent disease, serum samples were obtained at the time of clinical recurrence, and in the disease-free group, they were obtained postoperatively. The combined use of the markers was evaluated with logistic regression analysis. The sensitivities of the different tumour markers at various specificity levels were compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. When the five tumour markers, Dukes stage and location of the primary tumour were evaluated together in the same model, only CEA provided significant diagnostic information (p < 0.0005) in addition to the location of the primary tumour (p = 0.003). The diagnostic information provided by the other serum tumour markers was insignificant, although CA 72-4 approached borderline significance (p = 0.053). ROC curves were constructed and the difference in the values of the area under the curve (AUC) between the different serum tumour markers was determined at the time of clinical recurrence. Of the individual markers, the highest AUC was observed for CEA (AUC = 0.931). The difference in AUC values between CEA and the other tumour markers was highly significant (p < or = 0.001). CEA had the highest diagnostic accuracy in detecting recurrent colorectal cancer. Inclusion of CA 19-9, CA 242, CA 72-4 or hCGbeta in the model did not improve the accuracy, although CA 72-4 approached borderline significance (p = 0.053). Thus, CEA seems to retain its position as the surveillance marker of choice for patients surgically treated for colorectal cancer."}

{"id": "7863220", "title": "Carcinoembryonic antigen in staging and follow-up of patients with solid tumors.", "content": "Carcinoembryonic antigen in staging and follow-up of patients with solid tumors. The presence of a tumor antigen in human colonic carcinomas and their metastases was described about 25 years ago. This antigen, called carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), is one of the first known tumor markers. Since then, many more have been described, but CEA, determined alone or in combination with others, is still one of the most used. CEA is not organ specific and abnormal values may be found in a wide range of carcinomas, especially those with gastrointestinal involvement. CEA assay should not be used for cancer diagnosis because its sensitivity in patients without cancer metastases is low. In addition, abnormal CEA values may be found in patients with benign diseases. However, the probability of malignancy increases directly with CEA concentration. Its main clinical applications are prognosis, early diagnosis of recurrence and follow-up of patients with carcinomas. In a wide range of malignancies, CEA serum levels are clearly related to tumor stage. Presurgical CEA serum levels are a well-established prognostic factor in colorectal, breast and lung cancer. Patients presenting with increased preoperative CEA serum levels have both a shorter disease-free interval and lower survival than those with normal CEA levels. In the early diagnosis of recurrence, CEA also plays an important role: in about 70-85% of patients with colorectal tumors and in 40-50% with breast cancer, CEA serial increase is the first sign of tumor recurrence. In patients with disseminated tumors, serial determinations are also a useful tool for therapy monitoring: CEA values decrease with effective treatment while stable or increasing values are observed when treatment is not effective."}

This article reviews the clinical usefulness of three monoclonal antibody-defined tumor markers: CA 19-9 or GICA, CA 50, and CA 125. These markers have been regarded as worthwhile tools for diagnosis and monitoring the management of patients with cancers in selected sites. The CA 19-9 test in combination with the CEA test is a useful adjunct for staging in some advanced cases and for monitoring therapy in the majority of patients with carcinoma of the stomach. Sensitivity of these assays performed concurrently is comparable to CEA alone in colorectal carcinoma. The CA 19-9 test alone is useful for staging and monitoring management of patients with carcinoma of the pancreas. In colorectal carcinoma the CA 19-9 test is redundant because of significantly lower sensitivity than that of the CEA assay; the latter remains the test of choice. The CA 50 test per se is redundant since the CA 19-9 antigen is the target for both the C50 MAb and the NS 19-9 MAb. The CA 125 test contributes to staging and is a useful adjunct for monitoring management of patients with non-mucinous carcinomas of the ovary. If positive after initial surgery and chemotherapy, this test provides evidence of the presence of residual or metastatic tumor and thus may obviate the need for second-look surgery. These conclusions are based on a review of recent relevant publications as well as on our own results obtained from preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up of about 600 patients with cancers in relevant sites."}

Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors. Despite advances in therapy, mortality is still very high. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of paxillin in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW480 and its role in cell cycle and apoptosis. We also investigated the expression of paxillin in colorectal carcinoma tissues and its relationship to clinicopathological features and survival. Paxillin short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was constructed and transfected into the colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW480. The influence of paxillin shRNA on the cell cycle and cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry staining was used to assess the expression of paxillin and its association with the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, p53 and Bcl-2 in 102 patients with primary colorectal carcinoma. Western blotting was also used to investigate the expression of paxillin. Medical records were reviewed and a clinicopathological analysis was performed. In vitro, the percentage of cells in S phase was (45.23\u00b11.05)%, (43.53\u00b11.23)%, and (36.13\u00b10.57)% in the blank control group, negative control group, and paxillin shRNA group respectively. It was significantly decreased in the paxillin shRNA group (P = 0.000). The early apoptosis index of the paxillin shRNA group (17.2\u00b11.18%) was significantly increased compared to the control shRNA group ((13.17\u00b11.15)%, P = 0.013). Paxillin was positive in 71 (69.6%) patients, and it was found to be overexpressed in tumor tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues. Paxillin positive rate was higher in patients who are less than 50-years old (100.0% vs. 65.6%, P = 0.016). Paxillin expression was associated with a high histologic grade of carcinoma (81.4% vs. 61.0%, P = 0.031), a high rate of regional lymph node metastasis (22.5% vs. 13.0%, P = 0.031), mesenteric artery lymph node metastasis (100.0% vs. 64.8%, P = 0.008), distant metastasis (94.1% vs. 64.7%, P = 0.016) and a high Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) stage (94.1%, 73.2%, 60.0%, and 50%, P = 0.030). Multivariate analyses revealed that recurrence was associated with the rate of regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001) and paxillin expression (P = 0.024). Multivariate analysis indicated that the overall survival is related to the TNM stage (P = 0.000). In vitro, paxillin may promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis in SW480 cells. Paxillin may be a potential metastasis predictor, and an independent prognosis factor of recurrence. It may also be related to poor patient outcomes, but was not an independent predictor of survival."}

Randomized clinical trial in 39 National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom; 1202 eligible participants were recruited between January 2003 and August 2009 who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, including adjuvant treatment if indicated, with no evidence of residual disease on investigation. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: CEA only (n\u2009=\u2009300), CT only (n\u2009=\u2009299), CEA+CT (n\u2009=\u2009302), or minimum follow-up (n\u2009=\u2009301). Blood CEA was measured every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years; CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years; and the minimum follow-up group received follow-up if symptoms occurred. The primary outcome was surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent; secondary outcomes were mortality (total and colorectal cancer), time to detection of recurrence, and survival after treatment of recurrence with curative intent. After a mean 4.4 (SD, 0.8) years of observation, cancer recurrence was detected in 199 participants (16.6%; 95% CI, 14.5%-18.7%) overall; 71 of 1202 participants (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.2%) were treated for recurrence with curative intent, with little difference according to Dukes staging (stage A, 5.1% [13/254]; stage B, 6.1% [34/553]; stage C, 6.2% [22/354]). Surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent was 2.3% (7/301) in the minimum follow-up group, 6.7% (20/300) in the CEA group, 8% (24/299) in the CT group, and 6.6% (20/302) in the CEA+CT group. Compared with minimum follow-up, the absolute difference in the percentage of patients treated with curative intent in the CEA group was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.00; 95% CI, 1.23-7.33), in the CT group was 5.7% (95% CI, 2.2%-9.5%; adjusted OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.51-8.69), and in the CEA+CT group was 4.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.9%; adjusted OR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.10-8.71). The number of deaths was not significantly different in the combined intensive monitoring groups (CEA, CT, and CEA+CT; 18.2% [164/901]) vs the minimum follow-up group (15.9% [48/301]; difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -2.6% to 7.1%). Among patients who had undergone curative surgery for primary colorectal cancer, intensive imaging or CEA screening each provided an increased rate of surgical treatment of recurrence with curative intent compared with minimal follow-up; there was no advantage in combining CEA and CT.

{"id": "24195503", "title": "The role of tumor markers and biomarkers in colorectal cancer.", "content": "The role of tumor markers and biomarkers in colorectal cancer. A steady increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality has been observed in Europe, despite the continuous advancement in diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Accordingly, further progress is very much desirable in non-invasive diagnostic methods to enable early diagnosis, preand postoperative staging, and to assist in selecting the most suitable neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapeutic methods and post-treatment follow-up. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about the role of tumor markers and biomarkers in CRC diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. New biomarkers which are absent in healthy persons and present in CRC are still being investigated, especially those that can be detected at early development stage of the disease and used in screening tests. Unfortunately, no molecule that would meet all of the foregoing criteria has been identified so far. Carcinoembryonic antigen still remains the only tumor marker of recognised efficacy in monitoring patients during and after CRC therapy. Clinical studies and retrospective analyses allowed to discover and introduce to the clinical practice several bioindicators that assist in selecting the proper chemotherapeutic drug. There are attempts to \"personalise\" chemotherapy based on presence or absence of specific biomarkers. Therapy with anti-EGFR antibodies is desirable in patients with advanced CRC and absence of KRAS or BRAF mutation. Defining tumor phenotype - microsatellite instability (MSI) or microsatellite stability (MSS) and testing for the presence or absence of 18q chromosome deletion is very much desirable in standard 5-FU-based therapy. Analysis of UGT1A1 alleles may be the basis for modified dosing and reducing the potential toxicity of irinotecan. Studies on CRC biomarkers need to continue to closely examine the relationship between therapy and CRC curability. Targeted therapy against membrane receptors appears to be the future of CRC therapy."}

Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was performed with oral anticancer agents, including doxifluridine( 5'-DFUR), uracil/tegafur( UFT), and UFT/Leucovorin( LV); all patients also received polysaccharide K( PSK), an immunomodulator, in combination with chemotherapy. The 3-year OS and DFS rates for all patients were 83.4% and 78.6%, respectively, with no significant differences in these rates based on the chemotherapeutic agents used. The patients were assigned to low and high groups on the basis of the median cut-off values of each clinical laboratory parameter and the data obtained were subjected to univariate analysis. The results of the univariate analysis suggested that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels were significant prognostic factors. Further multivariate analysis using Cox regression analysis identified the preoperative CEA level alone as an independent factor. When stratification analysis was performed using a preoperative CEA level of 4.0 ng/mL as the cut-off value, the results indicated that the outcome of patients with a high preoperative CEA level may be 8-fold worse than that of patients with a low preoperative CEA level. For these patients, the use of chemotherapeutic drugs that elicit a more potent antitumor effect should be considered."}

A 62-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of cervicomediastinal lymph node swelling and high serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed an accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in the left supraclavicular lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes, and the pelvic cavity. Colonoscopy revealed rectal cancer, which was diagnosed by biopsy as a tubular adenocarcinoma. Because metastases from rectal cancer to the cervicomediastinal lymph nodes are rare, the patient underwent thoracoscopic mediastinal lymphadenectomy. A biopsy specimen from the paraaortic lymph nodes demonstrated papillary adenocarcinoma that was pathologically different from the rectal cancer; therefore, a diagnosis of mediastinal carcinoma with an unknown primary site was established. The patient underwent low anterior resection of the rectum for the rectal cancer, and no abdominal lymph node metastasis (pMP, N0/stage I) was found. Although radiotherapy was performed for the cervicomediastinal lymph nodes, the mediastinal carcinoma relapsed after 6 months. Because the patient desired oral chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, TS-1 was administered at a dosage of 80 mg/day for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest.

Here, we report an extremely rare case of local recurrence of rectal cancer 10 years after initial tumor resection. A 53-year-old man underwent abdominoperineal resection for advanced rectal cancer at a local hospital. The tumor was graded as pStage II (pA, pN0, pH0, pP0, pM0, curA)as per the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma, seventh edition, and diagnosed as a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma on histopathological examination. Subsequently, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy for 5 years. Although the patient lived without any recurrences after adjuvant chemotherapy, unfortunately, blood examination showed a high carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA)level 10 years after the initial surgical treatment. Computed tomography(CT)and positron emission tomography(PET)/CT revealed a perineal tumor, 40mm in size, without other distant metastases. On diagnosis of local recurrence of rectal cancer, the patient underwent surgical tumor resection at Okayama University Hospital. The tumor was determined to be a well- to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma by histopathological examination, suggesting local recurrence of the primary rectal adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the radial margin was free of cancer. The patient is now doing well without any re-recurrence 30 months after the second surgical treatment, without any adjuvant chemotherapy."}

Up-to-date it is unclear whether stage II colorectal cancer patients should receive adjuvant chemotherapy.The presence of high risk features (T4, CEA 5 ng dl, less than 12 lymph nodes examined) is an indication for Oxaliplatin based treatment. In their absence, there is no consensus, 5 Fluorouracil regimens, or observation only being equally recommended by oncologists. Microsatellite instability is associated with good prognosis in stage II colorectal cancer and also with poor response to 5 Fluorouracil and should be used as a predictive marker. We performed a prospective descriptive study on 115 consecutive patients who received surgical resection for colorectal cancer in our clinic during 2011 and 2012 using a risk stratification algorithm based on TNM staging, clinico pathologic and molecular markers. From the 44 stage II colorectal cancer patients, 10 cases were classified as high risk, in 26 cases we performed Immunohistochemical analysis that identified 8 patients with low risk microsatellite instability phenotype, with no indication for adjuvant chemotherapy; 26 intermediate risk patients received 5-FluoroUracil regimens. We believe that microsatellite instability testing provides a useful tool in the goal of better characterizing patients with stage II colorectal cancer in matters of risk of recurrence and likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy."}

A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with cecum cancer with extensive carcinomatous dissemination. He underwent open laparotomy, and the findings indicated a unresectable cecal tumor attached to the retroperitoneum; therefore, ileo-transverse colostomy was performed. After 6 courses of bevacizumab and XELOX therapy, the primary tumor as well as ascites and carcinomatous dissemination had disappeared, and a marked decrease in the serum carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA)level was noted. However, subsequently, positive emission tomography/computed tomography(PET/CT)indicated a recurrence of the primary tumor. Therefore, ileocecalectomy and D2 lymph node dissection were performed.

Elevated CRP and CEA levels were significant predictive factors for poor disease-free survival (DFS), and an elevated CRP level was identified as the only independent predictive factor for DFS. In addition, an elevated CRP level predicted for poorer OS and DFS in patients with pathological TNM stage I-II [ypN(-)].

The ASCO Panel concurred with the CCO recommendations and recommended endorsement, with the addition of several qualifying statements. Surveillance should be guided by presumed risk of recurrence and functional status of the patient (important within the first 2 to 4 years). Medical history, physical examination, and carcinoembryonic antigen testing should be performed every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. Patients at higher risk of recurrence should be considered for testing in the more frequent end of the range. A computed tomography scan (abdominal and chest) is recommended annually for 3 years, in most cases. Positron emission tomography scans should not be used for surveillance outside of a clinical trial. A surveillance colonoscopy should be performed 1 year after the initial surgery and then every 5 years, dictated by the findings of the previous one. If a colonoscopy was not preformed before diagnosis, it should be done after completion of adjuvant therapy (before 1 year). Secondary prevention (maintaining a healthy body weight and active lifestyle) is recommended. If a patient is not a candidate for surgery or systemic therapy because of severe comorbid conditions, surveillance tests should not be performed. A treatment plan from the specialist should have clear directions on appropriate follow-up by a nonspecialist."}

Converting chemotherapy followed by surgery is known to be associated with improved clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with hepatic metastasis. This study is to investigate the clinicopathological prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) after curative resection of primary and metastatic lesions. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 76 CRC patients who had initially had unresectable hepatic metastasis, which was considered resectable after systemic chemotherapy, and had undergone curative surgery in the period from January 2006 to December 2011. DFS was compared by assessing clinical data including age, sex, staging, number of hepatic lesion(s), size of the largest hepatic lesion and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. The median age was 57 years and 47 patients were male. The median DFS was 10.4 months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age <50 years (HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.43-5.10, p = 0.002) and CEA elevation after curative surgery (HR 2.20, 95% CI 1.11-4.36, p = 0.023) were associated with a shorter DFS.

Nowadays, evaluation of colorectal cancer prognosis and decision-making for treatment continues to be based primarily on TNM tumour stage. Administration of adjuvant chemotherapy is especially challenging for stage II patients that can have very different disease-related outcomes. Therefore, more reliable prognostic markers need to be developed to improve the selection of stage II patients at high risk for recurrence. Our purpose is to assess the prognostic value of preoperative serum CA 72.4 to improve the risk stratification of CRC patients. Preoperative sera collected from 71 unselected patients between January 1994 and February 1997 was assayed for CA 72.4 and CEA levels. Patients were followed-up for at least 30 months or until relapse. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the prognostic value was determined using Log-Rank test and Cox regression analysis. Preoperative CA 72.4 levels above 7 U/mL correlate with a worse prognosis, with associated recurrence and death percentages exceeding the displayed by CEA. In a multivariate analysis, its combination with CEA proved the most important independent factor predicting survival. Remarkably, at stage II CA 72.4 also discriminates better than CEA those patients that will relapse or die from those with a favourable prognosis; however, CEA has not a negligible effect on survival. The most outstanding finding of the present work is the correct classification of nearly every patient with bad prognosis (relapse or death) at TNM stage II when CEA and CA 72.4 are used altogether. This could improve the decision-making involved in the treatment of stage II colon cancer. Certainly further large-scale studies must be performed to determine whether CA 72.4 can be effectively used in the clinical setting."}

In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses.

Molecular biomarkers offer the potential for refining prognostic determinants in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Among patients with colorectal cancer, KRAS and BRAF are important biomarkers, but their role in patients undergoing surgical therapy for liver metastases is unknown. In this study, the incidence and prognostic significance of KRAS and BRAF mutations were determined in patients undergoing surgical therapy of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). KRAS and BRAF analysis was performed on 202 patients undergoing surgery for CRLM between 2003 and 2008. Tumor samples were analyzed for somatic mutations using sequencing analysis (KRAS, codon12/13, BRAF, V600E). The frequency of mutations was ascertained, and their impact on outcome was determined relative to other clinicopathologic factors. KRAS gene mutations were detected in 58/202 patients (29%). In contrast, mutation in the BRAF gene was identified in very low frequency in this surgical cohort, found in only 4/202 (2%) patients. On multivariate analysis, KRAS mutation was associated with worse survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.26), as well as recurrence risk (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.04-2.70). Although other clinicopathologic features, including tumor number, carcinoembryonic antigen, and primary stage were also associated with survival, KRAS status remained independently predictive of outcome. The low incidence of BRAF mutation limited assessment of its prognostic impact. Whereas KRAS mutations were found in approximately one third of patients, BFAF mutations were found in only 2% of patients undergoing surgery for CRLM. KRAS status was an independent predictor of overall and recurrence-free survival. Molecular biomarkers such as KRAS may help to refine our prognostic assessment of patients undergoing surgical therapy for CRLM."}

Over the last decade, radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) has been incorporated into the treatment algorithm of patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CLM). For this population, the local recurrence (LR) rate is a key parameter used to assess the success of RFA. LR is defined as development of new tumor abutting and/or in 1 cm of an ablation zone. The aim of this study is to correlate LR with other hepatic or extrahepatic recurrence and patient survival. Between 2000 and 2011, 252 patients with CLM underwent laparoscopic RFA of 883 lesions. These patients were followed under a prospective protocol with quarterly liver computed tomography and blood work, including carcinoembryonic antigen levels quarterly for the first 2 years and then biannually. Clinical scenarios associated with LR were identified and categorized as being \"isolated LR,\" \"LR associated with new liver disease,\" or \"LR associated with systemic disease.\" Demographic, clinical, and survival data were assessed using analysis of variance, Chi-square test, and univariate and multivariate Kaplan-Meier analysis. One hundred eighteen patients (47%) developed LR after their initial laparoscopic RFA. These were 85 men (72%) and 33 women (28%), with a mean age of 70 \u00b1 8 years. For this cohort, the mean of number of lesions was 3.1 \u00b1 0.2 cm (range, 1-11) and dominant tumor size 2.9 \u00b1 0.1 cm (range, 0.7-6.5) at the time of initial RFA. The LR rate per lesion was 29%. Of the patients who developed treatment failure at the RFA site, this was an isolated LR in 31 (26%) patients, associated with new liver disease in 51 (43%) and systemic metastases in 36 patients (31%). When patients with different clinical scenarios associated with LR were compared, no clinical predictors were identified to differentiate these subgroups. At a median follow up of 30 months (range, 3-113), the Kaplan-Meier median overall survival (OS) for patients with and without LR were 28 vs 31 months, respectively (P = .103). The OS for patients whose LR was isolated, associated with new liver and systemic recurrences was 39, 26, and 22 months, respectively (P = .009). This study shows that, although the presence of LR does not negatively impact on survival, the pattern of recurrent disease does. LR after RFA for CLM is most often associated with new liver and systemic recurrences, reflecting the aggressive biology of cancer in patients channeled to this treatment modality."}

The excisions were grouped according to the presence of LLN metastasis and compared in terms of the clinicopathological findings and oncological results. The correlation between the largest short-axis diameter of LLN measured by imaging and metastasis rates was explored. LLN metastases were identified in 32 excisions (40.0 %). The calculated short-axis LLN diameter predicting metastasis was 11.7 mm (before chemoradiotherapy) and 11.4 mm (before surgery). LLN metastasis was observed more frequently in the low rectum (p\u2009=\u20090.031) and associated with higher CEA levels (p\u2009=\u20090.048).

Thirteen patients who underwent liver resection for colorectal liver metastases (CRM) after preoperative chemotherapy were studied. Resected hepatic specimens were stained with an antibody against carcinoembryonic antigen to detect microscopic RCL, which were defined as discrete microscopic cancerous lesions surrounding the dominant metastases. Also, we evaluated the correlation between the outline of CRM based on CT finding and the detection of microscopic RCLs around CRM. RCL were found immunohistochemically in 10 patients (77.8%). There are one patient whose RCL was most distant from the main tumor more than 10 mm.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive energy delivery technique increasingly used for focal therapy to eradicate localized disease. RFA-induced tumor-cell necrosis generates an immunogenic source of tumor antigens known to induce antitumor immune responses. However, RFA-induced antitumor immunity is insufficient to control metastatic progression. We sought to characterize (a) the role of RFA dose on immunogenic modulation of tumor and generation of immune responses and (b) the potential synergy between vaccine immunotherapy and RFA aimed at local tumor control and decreased systemic progression. Murine colon carcinoma cells expressing the tumor-associated (TAA) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (MC38-CEA(+)) were studied to examine the effect of sublethal hyperthermia in vitro on the cells' phenotype and sensitivity to CTL-mediated killing. The effect of RFA dose was investigated in vivo impacting (a) the phenotype and growth of MC38-CEA(+) tumors and (b) the induction of tumor-specific immune responses. Finally, the molecular signature was evaluated as well as the potential synergy between RFA and poxviral vaccines expressing CEA and a TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules (CEA/TRICOM). In vitro, sublethal hyperthermia of MC38-CEA(+) cells (a) increased cell-surface expression of CEA, Fas, and MHC class I molecules and (b) rendered tumor cells more susceptible to CTL-mediated lysis. In vivo, RFA induced (a) immunogenic modulation on the surface of tumor cells and (b) increased T-cell responses to CEA and additional TAAs. Combination therapy with RFA and vaccine in CEA-transgenic mice induced a synergistic increase in CD4(+) T-cell immune responses to CEA and eradicated both primary CEA(+) and distal CEA(-) s.c. tumors. Sequential administration of low-dose and high-dose RFA with vaccine decreased tumor recurrence compared to RFA alone. These studies suggest a potential clinical benefit in combining RFA with vaccine in cancer patients, and augment support for this novel translational paradigm."}

It was expressed as median (95% confidence interval [CI]), with predictors of concentration determined. Group 1 (n=141) had pre-operative CEA of 8.9 (4.6-13.1), with 38.1% of patients being normal. Maximum tumour diameter correlated with CEA level (r=0.41, P<0.0001). Post-hepatectomy CEA was 2.3 (1.9-2.7; P<0.0001), with 81.1% of patients being normal. Group 2 (n=158) had CEA of 20.6 (9.4-31.9). Group 3 (n=361) had CEA of 2.0 (1.8-2.2). Sensitivity of CEA pre- and post-hepatectomy was 61.2% and 69.3%, respectively, while specificity was 79.8% for both groups. Concentration was elevated in hepatic colorectal metastases but is not a marker of resectability. A CEA reduction post-resection indicates that it may be used as an indicator of treatment response, while CEA is increased by tumour burden and lesion size."}

The clinical and pathological data of 628 patients with stage II or III colon cancer after radical resection from Jan. 2005 to Dec. 2008 in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. The overall recurrence and metastasis rate was 28.5% (179/628). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 70.3% and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 78.5%. Univariate analysis showed that age, smoking intensity, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, gross classification, histological differentiation, blood vessel tumor embolus, tumor gross pathology, multiple primary tumors, preoperative and postoperative serum concentration of CEA and CA19-9, and the regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy were correlated to recurrence and metastasis of colon cancer after radical resection. Multivariate analysis showed that regional lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, the regimen of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and preoperative serum concentration of CEA and CA19-9 were independent factors affecting the prognosis of colon cancer patients. Regional lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, elevated preoperative serum concentration of CEA and CA19-9, the regimen of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with single fluorouracil type drug are independent risk factors of recurrence and metastasis in patients with stage II-III colon cancer after radical resection."}

Forty-nine patients who underwent preoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery were enrolled in the study. The mean tumour ADC was measured independently from multiple, non-overlapping regions of interest (ROIs) to cover the entire tumour area on a single section by two radiologists and patients were followed postoperatively for a median of 16.4 months. Diagnostic accuracy of ADC for predicting treatment response and recurrence was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Univariate and multivariate analyses including clinical tumour (cT) staging, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, lymph-node involvement, tumour grade, surgical margin, vascular involvement, and ADC were performed with respect to recurrence. Interobserver agreement of ADC values was assessed. Twenty patients showed response to neoadjuvant therapy and recurrence was noted in 17 patients. Low pretreatment ADC, MRI findings of cT4 staging, and node involvement were significantly related to poor treatment response. Sensitivity and specificity of ADC = 0.833 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/s for prediction of treatment response was 75 and 48% for reader 1 and 65 and 52% for reader 2, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified pretreatment tumour ADC as the only predictive factor for recurrence. Sensitivity and specificity of ADC = 0.833 \u00d7 10(-3) mm(2)/s for prediction of recurrence was 86 and 77% for reader 1 and 80 and 69% for reader 2, respectively. Interobserver agreement for measuring ADC was good with a kappa value of 0.70. Pretreatment rectal tumour ADC values may be an early biomarker for predicting treatment response and local recurrence in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation."}

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of stage II colon cancer patients between January 2006 and December 2011. High-risk patients were defined those with any colonic obstruction/perforation, mucinous histology, inadequate lymph node sampling, T4 disease, lymphatic/ vascular or perineural invasion, preoperatively elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and high-grade tumor. All patients with high-risk features received adjuvant chemotherapy. There were 42 patients in the high-risk treatment group and 21 patients in the non-treatment (observation) group. There were no significant differences in terms of gender, tumor size, tumor localization, or the number of excised lymph nodes between the groups. The median follow- up time was 33.9 months in the treatment group and 29.3 months in the non-treatment group. Recurrence developed in 4 patients (6.3%), 3 of which were in the treatment group. DFS in both groups was statistically similar. Adjuvant chemotherapy in the high-risk patients resulted in similar DFS as that in the low-risk patients. Although the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer is unclear, it is rational to offer adjuvant chemotherapy to patients with high-risk stage II colon cancer."}

This study analyses how the prognostic capability of these variables changes in a conditional survival model. Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent an R0 resection of colorectal liver metastases from 1994 to 2004 at a single institution. In total, 807 patients were identified, with an 87-month median follow-up for survivors. Five- and 10-year disease-specific survivals (DSS) were 68% and 55%, respectively. The probability of further survival increased as the survival time increased. For 3-year survivors (n = 504), DSS were no longer significantly different between patients with a low (0-2) or high (3-5) clinical risk score (CRS, P = 0.19). On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of DSS for 3-year survivors were recurrence within the first 3 years after a liver resection, a pre-operative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) >200\u2009ng/ml and disease-free interval <12 months prior to the diagnosis of liver metastasis. However, for those patients who were recurrence free at 1 year, no clinico-pathological variables retained prognostic significance. After 3 years of DSS and 1 year of recurrence-free survival, baseline clinico-pathological variables have a limited ability to predict future survival. Early post-operative recurrence appears to be the most useful single clinical feature in estimating conditional DSS."}

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1543 patients with stage IIA colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgery between January 2000 and December 2007. The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were significantly lower in patients with a higher than normal preoperative s-CEA (90.5% vs. 82.5%, P<0.001, and 92.4% vs. 87.8%, P=0.034, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated preoperative s-CEA level, preoperative obstruction, rectal cancer, and dissection of fewer than 12 nodes were independent statistically significant prognostic factors that predicted disease-free survival in patients with stage IIA disease after curative resection. Elevated preoperative s-CEA concentration is a reliable predictor of recurrence after curative resection in patients with stage IIA colorectal cancer. Patients with stage IIA disease with elevated preoperative s-CEA level do worse than those with normal levels and might constitute a group to evaluate for adjuvant chemotherapy. Further studies on the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in this group are needed."}

Of them, 835 patients showed recurrence after primary curative resection for colorectal cancer. Recurrence occurred \u22645 years (n = 799) or >5 years (n = 36) after curative surgery. Variables and recurrence patterns were compared between the groups. Among the 835 patients who experienced recurrence, only 4.3% recurred >5 years after surgery. This group showed lower preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, more tumors with expanding growth, well-differentiated histology, and no lymph node metastasis (all P < 0.05). In terms of haematogenous metastasis, lung or liver was the most prevalent site in patients who recurred after >5 years or \u22645 years, respectively (P = 0.005). In rectal cancer patients, recurrence patterns revealed the same results. In colon cancer patients, the liver was the most prevalent site in both groups. After 5 years of follow-up, routine surveillance for detecting other malignancies seems to be sufficient. However, the possibility of late (particularly late pulmonary) recurrence should be considered. Radiologic examination to detect pulmonary metastasis should be considered in the follow-up program."}

Preoperative chemoradiation therapy in patients with rectal cancer results in pathologic complete response in approximately 10% to 30% of patients. Accurate predictive factors for obtaining pathologic complete response would likely influence the selection of patients best treated by chemoradiation therapy as the primary treatment without radical surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of tumor size, stage, location, circumferential extent, patient characteristics, and pretreatment CEA levels on the development of pathologic complete response after chemoradiation therapy. This study is a retrospective review. Five hundred thirty patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation therapy and radical surgery for rectal adenocarcinoma between 1998 and 2011 were identified. A total of 469 patients remained after excluding patients with a history of pelvic radiation (n = 2), previous transanal endoscopic microsurgery or polypectomy of the primary lesion (n = 15), concurrent malignant tumor (n = 14), and no information about pre- or posttreatment T stage in the chart (n = 30). Preoperative CEA levels were available for 267 patients (57%). Preoperative chemoradiation therapy and total mesorectal excision were performed in patients with rectal cancer. The primary outcome measured was pathologic complete response. : Ninety-six patients (20%) were found to have a pathologic complete response in the operative specimen. Low pretreatment CEA (3.4 vs 9.6 ng/mL; p = 0.008) and smaller mean tumor size (4.2 vs 4.7 cm; p = 0.02) were significantly associated with pathologic complete response. Low CEA levels and interruption in chemoradiation therapy were significant predictors of pathologic complete response in the multivariate analysis. When stratifying for smoking status, low CEA level was significantly associated with pathologic complete response only in the group of nonsmokers (p = 0.02). This study was limited by its retrospective design, missing CEA values, and lack of tumor regression grade assessment. We demonstrated an association between low pretreatment CEA levels, interruption in chemoradiation therapy, and pathologic complete response in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. The predictive value of CEA in smokers can be limited, and further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of smoking on the predictive value of CEA levels for pathologic complete response in rectal cancer."}

Tumor markers are gene products which signal the occurrence of tumors in different organs as well as their response to surgery and chemotherapy. The discovery of tumor markers occurred after the demonstration of tumor-specific transplantation antigens in chemically or virally induced tumors in syngenic rodents. The history of currently used tumor markers began in the 1940s, the first discovered being alpha-fetoprotein in 1956, followed by that of carcinoembryonic antigen in 1965. Since then the range of tumor markers has widened continously. Their chemical structure and genetics is now well known. Some may play part in tumor growth and development of metastases. The potential uses of tumor markers are general or high risk population screening, adjunct in diagnosis of cancer, preoperative indicator of tumor burden, indicator of therapeutic success, evidence of postoperative recurrences and use in tumor localization. However, there is no ideal tumor marker fulfilling all the criteria. Isotope-labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies and small molecular E-selectin inhibitors could play a role in the molecular radio- and chemotherapy of colon and pancreatic carcinomas.

Several reports have shown that certain pre-operative CEA intervals can be predictive of long-term outcomes and have subsequently implied that preoperative CEA may be useful to assess the risk of recurrence or death as a continuous number for individual cases. This analysis assesses if this hypothesis is valid after correction for confounders. All colon cancer patients operated on at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2004 through 2011 were considered for retrospective review. Association between outcomes and preoperative CEA was measured in intervals and as a linear relationship. Of the 1,071 patients operated for colon adenocarcinoma, 621 (57.9%) had a preoperative CEA drawn and were included in the analysis. In models using intervals, preoperative CEA did show association with (disease-free) survival, but this was shown to be chiefly a surrogate for metastatic presentation. In linear approaches adjusted for metastatic presentation, CEA loses all correlations with metastatic disease (P = 0.84), survival (P = 0.11), survival duration (P = 0.42) and disease-free interval (P = 0.94). Extrapolating the predictive value of certain preoperative CEA intervals to a continuous approach for use in a case-for-case basis is unjustified. Preoperative CEA may be a useful risk estimator but has limited significance for predictions of long-term outcomes in individual cases."}

Upon colon cancer metastasis resection in liver, disease outcome is heterogeneous, ranging from indolent to very aggressive, with early recurrence. The aim of this study is to investigate the capability of metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) levels measured in liver metastasis specimens to predict further recurrence of the disease. Gene expression and gene dosage of MACC1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) were assessed using quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction on a cohort of 64 liver metastasis samples from patients with complete follow-up of 36 months and detailed clinical annotation. The most relevant mutations associated to prognosis in colorectal cancer, KRAS, and PIK3CA were assessed on the same specimens with Sanger sequencing. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that MACC1 mRNA abundance is a good indicator of metastatic recurrence (AUC = 0.65, P < 0.05), whereas no such results were obtained with MET and HGF, nor with gene dosage. Generation of MACC1-based risk classes was capable of successfully separating patients into poor and good prognosis subgroups [hazard ratio (HR) = 5.236, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2068-22.715, P < 0.05]. Also KRAS mutation was significantly associated with higher risk of recurrence (HR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.048-4.09, P < 0.05). Cox regression multivariate analysis supported the independence of MACC1, but not KRAS, from known prognostic clinical information (Node Size HR = 3.155, 95% CI = 1.4418-6.905, P < 0.001, Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen HR = 2.359, 95% CI = 1.0203-5.452, P < 0.05, MACC1 HR = 7.2739, 95% CI = 1.6584-31.905, P < 0.01). MACC1, a new easily detectable biomarker in cancer, is an independent prognostic factor of recurrence after liver resection of colorectal cancer metastasis."}

To determine whether 1 of 2 vaccines based on dendritic cells (DCs) and poxvectors encoding CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and MUC1 (PANVAC) would lengthen survival in patients with resected metastases of colorectal cancer (CRC). Recurrences after complete resections of metastatic CRC remain frequent. Immune responses to CRC are associated with fewer recurrences, suggesting a role for cancer vaccines as adjuvant therapy. Both DCs and poxvectors are potent stimulators of immune responses against cancer antigens. Patients, disease-free after CRC metastasectomy and perioperative chemotherapy (n = 74), were randomized to injections of autologous DCs modified with PANVAC (DC/PANVAC) or PANVAC with per injection GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). Endpoints were recurrence-free survival overall survival, and rate of CEA-specific immune responses. Clinical outcome was compared with that of an unvaccinated, contemporary group of patients who had undergone CRC metastasectomy, received similar perioperative therapy, and would have otherwise been eligible for the study. Recurrence-free survival at 2 years was similar (47% and 55% for DC/PANVAC and PANVAC/GM-CSF, respectively) (\u03c7 P = 0.48). At a median follow-up of 35.7 months, there were 2 of 37 deaths in the DC/PANVAC arm and 5 of 37 deaths in the PANVAC/GM-CSF arm. The rate and magnitude of T-cell responses against CEA was statistically similar between study arms. As a group, vaccinated patients had superior survival compared with the contemporary unvaccinated group. Both DC and poxvector vaccines have similar activity. Survival was longer for vaccinated patients than for a contemporary unvaccinated group, suggesting that a randomized trial of poxvector vaccinations compared with standard follow-up after metastasectomy is warranted.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of high serum p53 antibody (p53Ab) levels in relation to curative resection of colorectal cancer. Between 2007 and 2010, 24 patients with colorectal cancer with higher-than-normal preoperative serum p53Ab, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were enrolled in this study. After curative resection, their serum p53Ab and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were measured at one, six, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. The relationship between clinicopathological features and the presence of serum p53Ab was evaluated. None of the patients developed recurrence up to 24 months after the surgery. The positive rate for CEA was 33.3% before surgery, 16.7% at one month after surgery, and 0% at six months and more, while the rate for p53Ab was 75% at six months, 70.8% at 12 months, 58.3% at 18 months, and 54.2% at 24 months after surgery. The positive rate for serum p53Ab at 24 months after the surgery correlated with the one before and that at one month after the surgery. For patients with colorectal cancer and high preoperative serum p53Ab levels, serum p53Ab does not seem to be a useful marker of recurrence after curative resection, since normalization of serum p53Ab levels requires years after surgery."}

Oncolytic measles viruses (MV) derived from the live attenuated vaccine strain have been engineered for increased antitumor activity, and are currently under investigation in clinical phase 1 trials. Approaches with other viral vectors have shown that insertion of immunomodulatory transgenes enhances the therapeutic potency. In this study, we engineered MV for expression of the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). For the first time, therapeutic efficacy and adaptive immune response in the context of MV oncolysis could be evaluated in the previously established immunocompetent murine colon adenocarcinoma model MC38cea. MC38cea cells express the human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), allowing for infection with retargeted MV. Intratumoral application of MV-GMCSF significantly delayed tumor progression and prolonged median overall survival compared with control virus-treated mice. Importantly, more than one-third of mice treated with MV-GMCSF showed complete tumor remission and rejected successive tumor reengraftment, demonstrating robust long-term protection. An enhanced cell-mediated tumor-specific immune response could be detected by lactate dehydrogenase assay and interferon-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Furthermore, MV-GMCSF treatment correlated with increased abundance of tumor-infiltrating CD3(+) lymphocytes analyzed by quantitative microscopy of tumor sections. These findings underline the potential of oncolytic, GM-CSF-expressing MV as an effective therapeutic cancer vaccine actively recruiting adaptive immune responses for enhanced therapeutic impact and tumor elimination. Thus, the treatment benefit of this combined immunovirotherapy approach has direct implications for future clinical trials."}

The aim of the study was to evaluate prospectively the clinical impact of 2-(F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) on the pretreatment assessment of patients with colorectal lung metastasis before radiofrequency (RF) ablation. The institutional review board approved this prospective study. The eligibility criteria for lung RF ablation were the presence of five or fewer colorectal lung metastases with a maximum tumor size of 3 cm and absence of extrapulmonary lesions. Lung RF ablation candidates who underwent pretreatment PET/CT studies were included. The incidence of detection of unexpected recurrent lesions on PET/CT was evaluated, along with its impact on subsequent treatments. Factors linked with the incidence of unexpected recurrent lesions were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Between October 2008 and June 2011, 60 patients were enrolled. Among the unexpected abnormal F-FDG accumulations found in 13 patients (21.7%), presence of extrapulmonary lesions was proved in 12 patients (20.0%, 12/60), prompting treatment strategy changes. One false-positive case was found (1.7%, 1/60). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting unexpected lesions by PET/CT were, respectively, 100, 97.9, and 98.3%. Elevation of the serum carcinoembryonic antigen level (>6.0 ng/ml) was the only significant factor linked with unexpected lesions in both univariate (P=0.02) and multivariate analyses (P=0.02). A PET/CT study should be performed in patients with colorectal lung metastasis before selecting them for lung RF ablation, especially when the carcinoembryonic antigen level is elevated."}

This study was conducted to investigate the prognostic factors of pulmonary metastases, focusing on the time of detection of pulmonary metastases related to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Between June 2003 and December 2010, 84 patients underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for pulmonary metastasis (PM) from CRC. The clinicopathological data of colorectal surgery and pulmonary metastasectomy were analysed retrospectively. Disease-free intervals (DFIs) were specifically classified into the following three groups related to adjuvant chemotherapy after colorectal operation: Group 1, metastasis detected at initial presentation; Group 2, metastasis detected during adjuvant chemotherapy; Group 3, metastasis detected after completion of chemotherapy. The prognostic influence of these variables on disease-free survival was analysed using the log-rank test for univariate analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis. The median follow-up durations for patients after curative resection of CRC and pulmonary metastasectomy were 48.6 and 28.8 months, respectively. After pulmonary metastasectomy, recurrence was seen in 49 (58.3%) patients-pulmonary recurrence in 37 and extrathoracic recurrence in 12. Young age (<54 years old) at CRC operation, more than one PM, a DFIs of <12 months, detection synchronously or under adjuvant chemotherapy, and high CEA level before metastasectomy were worse prognostic factors by univariate analysis. From multivariate analysis, the number of pulmonary metastases (multiple metastases, HR=2.121, 95% confidence interval 1.081-4.159, P=0.029) and DFIs related with adjuvant chemotherapy (Group 1+2, HR=1.982, 95% confidence interval 1.083-3.631, P=0.027) were found to be independent predictors of disease-free survival. Disease-free intervals in association with the time of adjuvant chemotherapy and number of metastases were independent poor prognostic factors for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer."}

A follow-up strategy in cancer aftercare can result in early detection of metastasis and/or recurrence. Therefore, sensitive and reliable diagnostic tests that are easy to perform are needed. Here, the authors present the combined use of the epitope detection in monocytes (EDIM)-TKTL1 and EDIM-Apo10 blood test in aftercare monitoring of a patient with colon carcinoma. Whereas the established tumor markers CEA and CA19-9 did not indicate metastasis even at a timepoint where clinical signs and imaging techniques already demonstrated metastasis, the combined application of the EDIM-TKTL1 and the EDIM-Apo10 blood tests was positive 9 months before detection of metastasis. These findings - taken together with recently published evaluation data of the EDIM-TKTL1 blood test - suggest that the combined application of the EDIM-TKTL1 and the EDIM-Apo10 blood tests might indicate metastasis earlier than established tumor markers and could serve as sensitive and noninvasive methods that might be used for early detection of colon cancer metastasis."}

Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most prevalent cancers in the western world, is treatable if detected early. However, 70% of CRC is detected at an advanced stage. This is largely due to the inadequacy of current faecal occult blood screening testing and costs involved in conducting population-based colonoscopy, the 'gold standard' for CRC detection. Another biomarker for CRC, carcinoembryonic antigen, while useful for monitoring CRC recurrence, is ineffective, lacking the specificity required early detection of CRC. For these reasons there is a need for more effective blood-based markers for early CRC detection. In this study we targeted glycoproteins secreted from the human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1215 as a source of potential CRC biomarkers. Secreted candidate glycoproteins were confirmed by MS and validated by Western blot analysis of tissue/tumour interstitial fluid (Tif) from LIM1215 xenograft tumours grown in immunocompromised mice. Overall, 39 glycoproteins were identified in LIM1215 culture media (CCM) and 5 glycoproteins in LIM1215 tumour xenograft Tif; of these, cadherin-17 (CDH17), galectin-3 binding protein (LGALS3BP), and tyrosine-protein kinase-like 7 (PTK7) were identified in both CM and glycosylation motifs. Swiss-Prot was used to annotate Tif. Many of the glycoproteins identified in this study (e.g., AREG, DSG2, EFNA1, EFNA3, EFNA4, EPHB4, ST14, and TIMP1) have been reported to be implicated in CRC biology. Interestingly, the cadherin-17 ectodomain, but not full length cadherin-17, was identified in CM, Tif and plasma derived from mice bearing the LIM1215 xenograft tumour. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cadherin-17 ectodomain in plasma. In this study, we report for the first time that the presence of full-length cadherin-17 in exosomes released into the CM. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: An Updated Secretome."}

From February 2003 to January 2011, 243 stage II and III CRC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in this retrospective study. The associations between neutrophil/ lymphocyte counts and disease free survival (DFS)/overall survival (OS) of CRC, and the risk factors for neutropenia/lymphopenia were investigated. No association of chemotherapy-associated neutrophil counts and CRC recurrence (AUC = 0.474, P = 0.534), death (AUC = 0.449, P = 0.249) was found by ROC analysis. However, the chemotherapy-associated lymphocyte counts could significantly affect CRC recurrence (AUC = 0.634, P = 0.001), or death(AUC = 0.607, P = 0.015), with a optimized cut-off of 0.66 \u00d7 10(9)/L for recurrence, and 0.91 \u00d7 10(9)/L for death, respectively.

In total, 609 patients with locally advanced (cStage II-III) mid to distal rectal cancer who underwent preoperative CRT and radical surgery between 2001 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. Predictive factors for pathologic CRT response were determined using multivariate logistic regression. A prognostic factor analysis was performed using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression. Elevated CEA levels (>5 ng/mL) were observed in 201 (33.0%) patients at diagnosis. Following preoperative CRT, downstaging (ypStage 0-I) occurred in 255 (41.9%) patients, of whom 88 had pathologic complete tumor regression. Pretreatment CEA was significantly associated with pathologic CRT response in terms of downstaging and tumor regression grade, and was the most relevant predictive factor. After a median follow-up period of 60 months, the 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 76.2% and 84.6%, respectively. Prognostic factors independently associated with recurrence or survival included ypStage, circumferential resection margin, and histologic grade. In patients with rectal cancer who received preoperative CRT, the pretreatment CEA level was a significant and independent predictor of pathologic CRT response. However, it may not be able to predict long-term outcomes independently of ypStage."}

We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with 43 lesions who underwent curative radiotherapy for isolated lung metastasis from colorectal cancer at nine institutions from 2003 and 2008. A total dose of 42-75 Gy at the peripheral planning target volume was administered in 3-35 fractions. The median biologically equivalent dose was 84 Gy (range, 58.5-180). Treatment response was complete in 10 (33.3%), partial in 13 (43.3%), stable in six (20.0%), and progressive in one patient (3.3%). The median follow-up period for all patients was 29.0 months (range, 5.0-93.8). Kaplan-Meier local control at 5 years was 44%. The median survival was 46.2 months, and the 5-year overall survival was 47%. Twenty-three patients (77%) experienced treatment failure, most of which were intrapulmonary failure.

In China, standard neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy has not been well accepted, not only because of financial constraints but also because of the poorly-tolerated long duration of the regimen. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of a modified neoadjuvant radiation regimen on the prognosis of rectal cancer patients in China. This was a nonrandomized cohort study evaluating outcomes of patients who chose to undergo preoperative radiotherapy compared with those who chose not to undergo preoperative radiotherapy (controls). The study was carried out in Peking University Cancer Hospital, a tertiary care cancer center in China. Records of patients with locally advanced, mid-to-low rectal cancer who underwent total mesorectal excision at Peking University Cancer Hospital from 2001 through 2005 were analyzed in this study. Patients who chose preoperative radiotherapy received a total dose of 30 Gy delivered in 10 once-daily fractions of 3.0 Gy each, with at least a 14-day delay of surgery after delivery of the last fraction. Tumor downstaging was evaluated. Local recurrence, distant metastases, and disease-free and overall survival were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 101 patients accepted and 162 patients declined the modified preoperative radiotherapy regimen. Of the 101 patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy, 5 (5%) had a complete response, and 50 (50%) achieved TNM downstaging. The local recurrence rate was 5% with preoperative radiotherapy and 18% in the control groups (p = 0.02). Within the preoperative radiotherapy group, 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were significantly higher in patients with T-, N-, or TNM-downstaging than in patients without downstaging. Evaluation of literature reports indicated that clinical safety and effectiveness of the modified protocol are comparable to results of standard neoadjuvant procedures. The allocation to study groups was not randomized, and patient self-selection may have introduced bias, particularly because patients with greater financial means were more likely to choose to undergo the preoperative radiotherapy regimen. Compared with surgery alone, this modified preoperative radiotherapy regimen is associated with significantly reduced local recurrence and complication rates, with improved survival in patients who show downstaging. The modified protocol offers a clinical outcome equivalent to standard preoperative radiotherapy regimens while offering an alternative for increasing the flexibility of preoperative radiation regimens in China."}

Between 2000 and 2010, 395 patients with CLM undergoing RFA (n = 295), liver resection (n = 94) or both (n = 6) were identified from a prospective IRB-approved database. Demographic, clinical and survival data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. RFA patients had more comorbidities, number of liver tumors and a higher incidence of extrahepatic disease compared to the Resection patients. The 5-year overall actual survival was 17 % in the RFA, 58 % in the Resection group (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, multiple liver tumors, dominant lesion >3 cm, and CEA >10 ng/ml were independent predictors of overall survival. Patients were followed for a median of 20 \u00b1 1 months. Liver and extrahepatic recurrences were seen in 69 %, and 29 % of the patients in the RFA, and 40 %, and 19 % of the patients in the Resection group, respectively. In this large surgical series, we described the characteristics and oncologic outcomes of patients undergoing resection or RFA for CLM. By having both options available, we were able to surgically treat a large number of patients presenting with different degrees of liver tumor burden and co-morbidities, and also manage liver recurrences in follow-up."}

We used human telomerase reverse transcriptase, cytokeratin-19, cytokeratin-20, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as the biomarkers to detect CTCs in 90 stage III colon cancer patients undergoing curative resection followed by mFOLFOX chemotherapy. Post-chemotherapeutic relapse occurred in 30 (33.3%) patients. By univariate analysis and multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis, perineural invasion (hazard ratio (HR): 2.752; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.026-7.381), high post-chemotherapeutic serum CEA levels (HR: 2.895; 95% CI: 1.143-7.333) and persistent presence of post-chemotherapeutic CTCs (HR: 6.273; 95% CI: 2.442-16.117) were independent predictors of post-chemotherapeutic relapse. In addition, the persistent presence of post-chemotherapeutic CTCs strongly correlated with reduced disease-free survival and overall survival. Accuracy of detecting relapse in post-chemotherapeutic stage III colon cancer patients by analysing the persistent presence of post-chemotherapeutic CTCs was higher than that by post-chemotherapeutic CEA levels (odds ratio: 50.091 vs 5.211). The persistent presence of post-chemotherapeutic CTCs is a potential powerful surrogate marker for determining clinical outcome in stage III colon cancer patients receiving adjuvant mFOLFOX chemotherapy."}

When confronted with a suspicious rise in CA 15.3 in asymptomatic breast cancer patients following primary treatment and negative or equivocal conventional imaging findings, FDG PET/CT allows assessment of the site and extent of the recurring disease with an accuracy of 83%. Both FDG PET and FDG PET/CT are superior when compared to CT alone for the purpose of recurrence detection in patients suffering from ovarian carcinoma who have completed primary therapy but demonstrate a rising serum CA-125 level. As the global accuracy of CT alone for detection of recurrence of ovarian cancer approximates 80%, CT scan should be performed upfront to identify the site of recurrence. When confronted with negative or equivocal CT findings, FDG PET alone or FDG PET/CT should be added. In patients with rising serum CEA levels that have undergone primary treatment for a colorectal carcinoma, both FDG PET and FDG PET/CT allow detection of tumor recurrence with an accuracy of 95%, well above that of CT and MRI. Available studies further suggest that FDG/PET findings will affect treatment management in 28-50% of these patients. The detection rate of both 11C-choline and 18F-choline PET and PET/CT for local, regional, and distant recurrence in prostate carcinoma patients with a biochemical recurrence increases with rising PSA value at the time of imaging and reaches about 75% in patients with PSA > 3 ng/mL. Furthermore, PET and PET/CT with [11C]- and [18F]-choline derivates may be helpful in the clinical setting for optimization of individualized treatment."}

Patients who had surgery with curative intent for CLM from 2000 to 2009 were included. The impact of postoperative complications, patient characteristics, disease stage and treatment on long-term survival was analysed using multivariable Cox regression models. A total of 251 patients were included. The median age was 58 (interquartile range 51-68) years and there were 87 women (34.7 per cent). A minor or major postoperative complication developed in 41 and 14 patients respectively, and five patients (2.0 per cent) died after surgery. The 5-year recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival rates were 19.5 and 41.9 per cent respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that postoperative complications independently predicted shorter RFS (hazard ratio (HR) 2.36, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.56 to 3.58) and overall survival (HR 2.34, 1.46 to 3.74). Other independent predictors of shorter RFS and overall survival included lymph node metastasis, concomitant extrahepatic disease, a serum carcinoembryonic antigen level of at least 100 ng/dl, and the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFS only). The severity of complications also correlated with RFS (P = 0.006) and overall survival (P = 0.001). Postoperative complications were independently associated with decreased long-term survival after surgery for CLM with curative intent.

While aneuploidy indicates poor survival prognosis and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels the presence of recurrent disease, the predictive value of both markers regarding imminent metachronous metastases is unclear. Sixty patients with distant recurrence throughout a 5-year follow-up (TM+) were randomly chosen and 60 patients without metastasis matched to this cohort (TM-). In addition, an enlarged collective (n\u2009=\u2009217; n TM+\u2009=\u200985, n TM-\u2009=\u2009132) with median follow-up of 79.2\u00a0months was assessed by logistic regression regarding metachronous metastases. Univariate and stepwise regression analyses included clinicopathological characteristics, preoperative CEA levels and aneuploidy assessed by DNA image cytometry. The matched-pair collective showed aneuploidy in 71.1\u00a0% (TM-) and 85.0\u00a0% (TM+; p\u2009=\u20090.076), and elevated CEA in 24.5\u00a0% (TM-) and 52.2\u00a0% [TM+; odds ratio (OR), 3.414; p\u2009=\u20090.007].

Our data show that aneuploidy and elevated CEA levels besides increased T category could serve for individual risk assessment to predict metachronous metastases. The fact that still aneuploidy missed the significance level by a small margin emphasizes the need for larger validation studies."}

Despite improved overall survival rates after potentially curative liver resection (~50-58% at 5 years), almost half of patients experience disease recurrence highlighting the need for a precise definition of outcomes to stratify patients for clinical trials and to guide treatment decisions. In the past, several factors, such as an advanced primary T stage, the primary N+ status, a large tumor size, multiple tumors, a disease-free interval of <12 months, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level, the presence of an extrahepatic disease, and the margin width (<1 cm) and status (positive), have been recognized to predict poor outcomes, but most of them lack the sensitivity for accurate individual prognostication. Thus, in recent years, new factors, such as response to chemotherapy, either clinical or pathological, that more closely reflect tumor biology have been established and adopted in the clinical practice. Similarly, biomarkers of poor prognosis, especially mutations in KRAS and BRAF and the expression of thymidylate synthase, have been studied, yielding promising results. However, robust evidence of their prognostic utility awaits prospective validation."}

This study aims to evaluate the rate and identify factors that affect pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early age-of-onset rectal cancer. This study is a retrospective review. The investigation was conducted at a tertiary-care cancer referral center. Included were 193 consecutive patients \u2264 50 years of age with rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection. No interventions were performed. The primary outcome measured was the pathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment. The median age was 44 years, and 34% of the patients were female. The median distance from the anal verge was 7 cm. The median percentage of lumen occupied by tumor was 50%. The median CEA level was 3.5 ng/mL. The median treatment response was 80%. The mean number of lymph nodes examined was 15 per patient. Twenty-two percent of patients had a complete or near-complete (\u2265 95%) response to neoadjuvant treatment. Seventy-seven percent of evaluable patients experienced tumor or lymph node downstaging on pathologic examination. The presence of adverse histologic features, percentage of lumen occupied by tumor, and CEA level differed between those with <95% response and those with \u2265 95% response to neoadjuvant therapy, although CEA level was not significant when stage IV patients were excluded. This is a retrospective review with heterogeneity in workup, treatment regimens, and interval to surgery. Long-term oncologic outcomes are not available. The rate of response to neoadjuvant treatment appears similar in patients with early age-of-onset rectal cancer to non-age-based cohorts in the literature.

In a multivariate analysis with potential variables, APR itself was not a risk factor for increased local recurrence (LR) or reduced survival (P = 0.243-0.994). Circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement as an operation-related risk was 1.6-fold more frequent in the APR group and was significantly associated with LR and systemic recurrence (OR, 2.487-4.017; P < 0.01). Circumferential margin positivity (CRM+) was concurrently correlated with advanced stage, larger tumor (long diameter, >4 cm), and longer sagittal midpelvic diameter (>10 cm) in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.001-0.05). The site of metastasis did not differ between the two groups, with the exception of lung metastasis which was more frequent in the APR group (APR vs. LAR: 15.9 vs. 10 %, P = 0.015). In the APR group, CRM+ and the presence of an infiltrating tumor were correlated with disease-free survival (hazard ratio (HR), 1.644 and 1.654, respectively), whereas elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen and LVI+ were correlated with overall survival (HR, 1.57 and 1.671, respectively), in a multivariate analysis with potential variables (P < 0.05). When performed with appropriate skill to achieve R0 resection, APR can be used safely without impairing oncological outcome, although sphincter-preserving surgery should remain the preferred option."}

Serum levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), receptor of glycation end products (RAGE) and activity of desoxyribonuclease were compared with response to therapy regularly determined radiologically 3 months after therapy and with overall survival. Serum levels of HMGB1 were increased already 24 hr after RE, while RAGE levels were decreased and DNAse remained unchanged. In radiological staging, 35 patients demonstrated disease progression while 14 patients had stable disease or remission. Serum HMGB1 levels 24 hr after RE were significantly higher in progressive than in nonprogressive patients while for RAGE and DNAse no difference was observed between the response groups. Concerning overall survival, high pretherapeutic (0 hr) and 24 hr levels of HMGB1 were associated with poor outcome.

A phenomenon of serum tumor biomarker surge or flare that ensues shortly after initiating cancer therapy and that may precede the actual therapeutic response-related decline is poorly understood and remains under-appreciated. However, it may have a significant clinical implication as it could be misinterpreted in clinical practice as therapeutic failure and lead to a premature discontinuation of potentially effective therapy. Therefore, in the present study, attempts have been made to understand the behavior of this phenomenon with respect to a reported median incidence, duration, and its relationship to clinical response. The results of these analyses suggest a significantly lower incidence of this phenomenon with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as determined in colorectal cancer and prostate specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer as compared to the other biomarkers studied (p=0.006). Furthermore, regardless of the type of biomarker or the extent of its incidence, a therapy-related initial surge appears to correlate with eventual response to therapy. Although, the biologic significance of this phenomenon is currently elusive, two distinct hypothesis-generating cases with CEA and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are presented that, if supported by further research, would provide insights into the role of a biomarker surge in overall tumor growth control by cancer therapy."}

The objective of this study was to evaluate pretreatment clinical parameters as predictive factors for complete pathological response after long-term chemoradiotherapy (RCT) for rectal cancer. Tumor downstaging after RCT for rectal cancer can be obtained in half of cases, whereas a complete pathological response (CPR) is reported to range between 15 and 30%. It is not possible to foresee before therapies who will respond. Patients with stage II-III rectal cancer that had undergone RCT and rectal resection between January 1995 and October 2010 were considered. Patients were divided in those who achieved a CPR, \"CR\" group, and those who did not achieve a CPR, \"NCR\" group. Univariate and multivariate analyses between groups were performed considering the clinical parameters: gender, age, ASA score, preoperative hematic CEA, tumor grading; distance of the tumor from the anal verge, maximum tumor diameter, TNM stage, and neoadjuvant treatment details. Among 260 patients, 43 (16.5%) achieved a CPR. The two groups resulted homogeneous for age, sex, pretreatment status, and tumor stage. A CEA <5 ng/dl and distance from anal verge >5 cm were correlated with CPR at multivariate analysis. Patients with both these conditions presented a significantly higher CPR rate (30.6%) as well as improved 5-year survival. CPR was also correlated with improved survival. Very low tumors with a high serum CEA are very unlikely to reach a CPR. The predictive value of these easily available clinical factors should not be underestimated, and better therapeutic strategies for these tumors are needed."}

We aimed to identify prognostic factors after pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer and propose the clinical application of them. Furthermore, we endeavored to provide a rationale for pulmonary metastasesectomy. Several prognostic factors have been proposed, but clinical application of them remains unclear. Moreover, there is no theoretical evidence that pulmonary metastasectomy is indicated for colorectal cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 1030 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer from 1990 to 2008. Prognostic factors were identified and the relationship of recurrent sites after pulmonary resection to pulmonary tumor size was assessed. Overall 5-year survival was 53.5%. Median survival time was 69.5 months. Univariate analysis showed tumor number (P < 0.0001), tumor size (P < 0.0001), prethoracotomy serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P < 0.0001), lymph node involvement (P < 0.0001), and completeness of resection (P < 0.0001) to significantly influence survival. In multivariate analysis, all remained independent predictors of outcome. In patients whose recurrent sites extended downstream from the lung via hematogenous colorectal cancer spread, pulmonary tumor size was significantly larger than in those with recurrent sites confined to the lung and regions upstream from the lung. We should utilize these prognostic factors to detect patients who might benefit from surgery. Therefore, we should periodically follow up advanced colorectal cancer patients by chest computed tomography to detect small pulmonary metastases before serum CEA elevation. Metastases to the lung or organs upstream from the lung are regarded as semi-local for colorectal cancer. This concept provides a rationale for validating surgical indications for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer."}

CEACAM6 gene expression in human colon tissues was performed by tissue microarray and analyzed using RT-PCR (each of normal and tumor tissue, n=40) and immunohistochemical and clinicopathological (colon cancer patients, n=143) analyses. CEACAM6 transcriptional and translational levels were significantly upregulated in human tumor tissues compared to non-tumor regions, and clinicopathological analysis revealed a significant correlation between CEACAM6 protein expression and Dukes' stage (p<0.001). High expression levels of CEACAM6 were significantly associated with lower overall survival (p<0.001) and shorter recurrence-free survival (p<0.001). We demonstrated that knockdown of CEACAM6 with CEACAM6-specific small interfering RNA in colorectal cancer cells attenuated invasivity (35%); conversely, the overexpression of CEACAM6 increased invasiveness. CEACAM6 is significantly upregulated in colon cancer tissues and is closely associated with poor prognosis, indicating that CEACAM6 might be used as a tumor biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer."}

The purpose of this study was to investigate novel predictors of early relapse in stage I-III CRC and further to determine their correlation with disease outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed clinicopathological features and VEGF expression by immunohistochemical staining in 100 stage I-III CRC patients undergoing curative resection to identify predictors of postoperative early relapse. Among 100 patients, 40 patients were classified into early relapse group, and 60 patients were categorized into non-early relapse group. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that vascular invasion (P = 0.048), perineural invasion (P = 0.042), VEGF overexpression (P = 0.023), and high postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (P = 0.004) were independent predictors of early relapse. Additionally, we found that with more predictors such as the combined incidence of vascular invasion, perineural invasion, VEGF overexpression, and postoperative CEA levels are involved, the incidence of early postoperative relapse increases. Moreover, VEGF overexpression predicted not only early postoperative relapse but also disease-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.002). This study suggests that VEGF overexpression is an important predictor of early postoperative relapse in patients with stage I-III CRC and may help identify patients who would benefit from intensive follow-up and therapeutic programs."}

A bi-institutional database was used to perform an external validation of this model. Ninety-seven patients operated for CRLM and EHD between 1982 and 2011 in two institutions was analyzed. The proposed prognostic model was validated in this cohort using Cox proportional hazards models and the concordance index (c). Of the five proposed risk factors, only EHD other than isolated lung metastases was found to independently predict overall survival [Hazards Ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20092.10 (95% CI: 1.01-4.40)]. Although, the number of risk factors was marginally associated with overall survival in univariate analysis (P\u2009=\u20090.049), the performance of the proposed prognostic model was poor when applied to our cohort (c\u2009=\u20090.64).

Data from all patients in follow-up after intentionally curative treatment for CRLM from 1990 to 2010 were analyzed. All patients underwent the same follow-up schedule. The way in which recurrences became apparent (i.e., CEA increase, routine imaging, or both) was registered. The specificity and sensitivity of increases in CEA before finding recurrent disease were calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. An economic evaluation of the cost per resectable tumor recurrence was performed. ROC curves showed that a significant CEA increase was defined as a 25 % increase from the previous value. Recurrences were detected in 46 % of the procedures through CEA increase concomitant with positive imaging, in 23 % through CEA increase without positive findings on routine imaging, and in 31 % through positive imaging without an increase in CEA. The resectability of recurrences did not differ between triggers. Cost per curable recurrence was <euro>2,196 for recurrences found via CEA alone and <euro>6,721 for recurrences found with imaging and CEA. In the follow-up of patients after liver surgery for CRLM, a 25 % increase in CEA serum level can accurately detect recurrences, but routine imaging is indispensable. In patients with CRLM, we advocate both CEA monitoring and imaging in the follow-up after liver surgery."}

All cancer patients are documented in our prospective cancer registry since 1995. Data of patients who underwent liver and lung resection for colorectal metastases were extracted and analysed. Sixty-five patients underwent surgery for liver and lung metastases. In 33 cases, the first distant metastasis was diagnosed synchronously to the primary tumour. For the remaining patients, median time interval between primary tumour and first distant metastasis was 18 months (5-69 months). Complete resection was achieved in 51 patients (79 %) and was less likely in patients with synchronous disease (p = 0.017). Negative margins (p = 0.002), the absence of pulmonary involvement in synchronous metastases (p = 0.0003) and single metastases in both organs (p = 0.036) were associated with a better prognosis. Five- and 10-year survival rates for all patients are 57 and 15 % from diagnosis of the primary tumour, 37 and 14 % from resection of the first metastasis and 20 and 15 % from resection of the second metastasis. After complete resection, 5- and 10-year survival rates increased to 61 and 18 %, 43 and 17 % as well as 25 and 19 %, respectively.

After median 44-month follow-up (interquartile range, 25 to 64 months), 119 patients (20%) recurred: 105 distant, 7 local, 7 local and distant, and 112 distant-only recurrence. Ninety-three (78%) had single-organ recurrence, and 26 (22%) had multiple-organ recurrence. The most common site of distant recurrence was lung (69% of all patients with distant relapse); 20% had liver recurrence. Fourteen patients (2.4%) recurred locally. Pulmonary metastases were most commonly identified by computed tomographic scan versus abnormal positron emission tomographic (PET) scan or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Risk factors associated with pulmonary recurrence were the following: pathologic stage, tumor distance from anal verge, lymphovascular or perineural invasion. Five-year freedom from pulmonary recurrence for patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 risk factors was 99%, 90%, 61%, and 42%, respectively. Thirty of 59 patents with pulmonary recurrence underwent lung metastasectomy; 3-year freedom from recurrence was 37%. Unlike colon cancer, which most frequently recurs in the liver, locally advanced rectal cancer treated with CMT relapses most frequently in the lung. Pulmonary metastasis was associated with advanced pathologic stage, low-lying tumor, lymphovascular invasion, or perineural invasion. Confirmation of pulmonary metastasis usually requires serial imaging because metastases are often small when initially detected, well below the resolution of PET, and not necessarily associated with elevated CEA.

Radical resection is the most effective treatment for patients with colorectal liver metastases offering five year survival rates between 36-60%. Unfortunately only 20% of patients are resectable at time of presentation. Radiofrequency ablation is an alternative treatment option for irresectable colorectal liver metastases with reported 5 year survival rates of 18-30%. Most patients will develop local or distant recurrences after surgery, possibly due to the outgrowth of micrometastases present at the time of liver surgery.

The Hepatica study is a two-arm, multicenter, randomized, comparative efficacy and safety study. Patients are assessed no more than 8 weeks before surgery with CEA measurement and CT scanning of the chest and abdomen. Patients will be randomized after resection or resection combined with RFA to receive CAPOX and Bevacizumab or CAPOX alone. Adjuvant treatment will be initiated between 4 and 8 weeks after metastasectomy or resection in combination with RFA. In both arms patients will be assessed for recurrence/new occurrence of colorectal cancer by chest CT, abdominal CT and CEA measurement. Patients will be assessed after surgery but before randomization, thereafter every three months after surgery in the first two years and every 6 months until 5 years after surgery. In case of a confirmed recurrence/appearance of new colorectal cancer, patients can be treated with surgery or any subsequent line of chemotherapy and will be followed for survival until the end of study follow up period as well.

Its contribution to screening for local recurrence is however rather limited since most recurrences develop in an extraluminal localization. CEA: Assayed at 8 months, repeated carcinoembryonic antigen assay can detect asymptomatic recurrence in 50 to 60% of the cases, usually 4 to 8 months prior to other explorations. Specificity is high (85% to 95% depending on the series), allowing exploratory laparotomy if CEA alone is elevated. However, the only randomized study evaluating CEA was unable to demonstrate any prolongation of survival with monthly tests. OPTIMAL FOLLOW-UP: There is some debate about the usefulness of intensive clinical and radiographic follow-up as the 4 randomized studies available were unable to demonstrate any beneficial effect. It must be noted however that the number of patients included in these studies was too low to evidence a small improvement in survival rates. In France, a 6% improvement at 5 years would result in 200 fewer deaths due to Duke C colorectal cancer annually. A large multicentric randomized study will be initiated shortly in France to evaluate the impact of intensive CEA monitoring versus no monitoring and intensive versus periodical radiological follow-up."}

Guidelines for colonoscopy, liver imaging, and CEA were met by 80.4%, 47.2%, and 22% of patients, respectively. Guideline concordance for colonoscopy was predicted by annual contact with a surgeon, higher income, and the diagnosis of colon (rather than rectal) cancer. Adherence was lower in those older than 70 years and with higher comorbidity. For liver imaging, significant predictors were annual contact with an oncologist, receipt of chemotherapy, and diagnosis of colon cancer. Concordance with CEA guidelines was higher with annual contact with an oncologist and high levels of family physician contact, and lower in urban residents, in those older than 70, and in those with stage II disease.

To study the expression of angiotensin-2 (Ang-2), Tie-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in colorectal cancer and analyze their relationship with the occurrence, recurrence, metastasis, angiogenesis and prognosis of colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemistry with SP method was used to detect the expressions of Ang-2, Tie-2 and VEGFR-2 in 118 colorectal cancer, 40 adjacent normal tissue and 40 benign colorectal lesion specimens. The positivity rates of Ang-2, Tie-2 and VEGFR-2 in colorectal cancer tissue were 74.58%, 69.49%, and 61.02%, respectively, significantly higher than those in the adjacent normal tissues (25.00%, 17.50%, and 17.50%, P<0.05) and benign colorectal lesion tissues (35.00%, 32.50%, and 32.50%, P<0.05). The rates of two or three coexpression were significantly higher than that of a single expression in the cancer tissues (61.02% vs 15.25%). The microvascular density (MVD) of colorectal cancer tissues was 31.43\u221310.50, significantly higher than that of the adjacent normal tissues (10.61\u22133.76) and benign colorectal lesions (16.89\u22133.83) (P<0.05).

The relationship between preoperative prealbumin and cancer survival has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between preoperative nutritional conditions, including prealbumin and albumin concentrations, and the risk of recurrence in cases with operable colorectal carcinoma. One hundred fifty-eight patients who underwent elective colorectal resection were analyzed in this study. Of the eligible cases, 56 (35.4%) had decreased serum prealbumin and 15 (9.5%) had decreased serum albumin preoperatively. Among 158 cases in this study, 18 (11.4%) had disease recurrence. In the univariate analysis, the depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, serum albumin, prealbumin, and carcinoembryonic antigen were the factors significantly associated with disease recurrence. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only serum albumin was a predictor of the recurrence; however, serum prealbumin lost its significance on multivariate analysis. Time to tumor recurrence by Kaplan-Meier curves significantly differed among patients with low serum albumin and prealbumin level. Our results suggest that prealbumin and albumin may be sensitive indicators of the risk of recurrent disease; however, low serum albumin levels are more useful than prealbumin in predicting short-term disease recurrence in operable colorectal cancer."}

The concentrations of hCG\u03b2 were determined in serum collected preoperatively from 324 patients with colorectal cancer, of whom 270 were curatively treated. The serum concentrations of hCG\u03b2 were associated with increasing age and they were higher in women than in men. Using the 75th percentile (1.55 pmol/L) as a cut-off for serum hCG\u03b2, overall survival (OS) was shorter in patients with elevated concentrations (HR 1.95; 95% CI 1.39-2.74; P=0.004), and this association was stronger in women (P=0.022) than in men (P=0.061).

This study is a retrospective analysis of oncologic outcomes of patients with T3 rectal cancer grouped by mesorectal extension depth (T3a, <1 mm; T3b, 1-5 mm; T3c, 5-15 mm; T3d, >15 mm). This study was conducted at a tertiary referral cancer hospital. From 2003 to 2009, 291 patients who underwent a curative surgery were included. Oncologic outcomes in terms of disease-free survival were analyzed. The 5-year disease-free survival rate according to T3 subclassification was 86.5% for T3a, 74.2% for T3b, 58.3% for T3c, and 29.0% for T3d. It was significantly higher in T3a,b tumors than that in T3c,d tumors (77.6% vs 55.2%, p < 0.001). On univariate and multivariate analysis, prognostic factors affecting recurrence were preoperative CEA level \u2265 5 ng/mL (HR 2.617, 95% CI 1.620-4.226), lymph node metastasis (HR 3.347, 95% CI 1.834-6.566), and mesorectal extension depth >5 mm (HR 1.661, 95% CI 1.013-2.725). In subgroup analysis, independent prognostic factors were preoperative CEA level and mesorectal extension depth >5 mm for 200 patients with ypT3 rectal cancer and preoperative CEA level and lymph node metastasis for 91 patients with pT3 rectal cancer. This study lacks quality of surgery plane evaluation because of its retrospective nature. Moreover, pathologic examination was not done with a whole-mount section. Depth of mesorectal extension >5 mm is a significant prognostic factor in patients with T3 rectal cancer.

Preoperative D-dimer levels correlated with liver tumor volume (p = .04) and CEA (p = .003). D-dimer levels increased by a mean of 11.4 \u00b1 1.5 folds after RFA on POD#7 and returned to preoperative values in three months. The rate of the elevation of D-dimer values after RFA was related to tumor volume ablated. The median overall survival was six months for patients with preoperative D-dimer > 1,000 ng/ml vs. 32 months for patients with D-dimer < 1,000 ng/ml (p = .02).

In this work, a novel label-free resonance light scattering (RLS) spectral CEA assay was developed based on the combination of highly selective immunoreaction and ultrasensitive RLS technique. In Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.5), the specific immunoreaction between CEA antigen and mouse anti-CEA formed immune complexes which had a maximum RLS spectral peak at 389.0 nm, with the existence of physiological saline and polyethylene glycol 20,000 (PEG 20,000). Under the optimal conditions, the magnitude of enhanced RLS intensity (\u0394I(RLS)) was proportional to the concentration of CEA in the range from 0.1 to 60 ng mL(-1), with a detection limit (LOD, 3\u03c3) of 0.03 ng mL(-1). The characteristics of RLS, the CEA immunocomplex, the immune response, the ratio of CEA antigen and mouse anti-CEA, and the optimum conditions of the immunoreaction have been investigated. The CEA concentrations of 20 serum specimens detected by the developed assay showed consistent results in comparison with those obtained by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. And this method has many satisfying merits including label-free, sensitivity and high selectivity."}

Surgical resection remains the only option of cure for patients with colorectal liver metastases, and no patient should be precluded from surgery. There is much controversy not only regarding the most appropriate therapeutic approach in the neoadjuvant setting but also after surgery is performed. Many patients will experience early relapses but others will be long survivors. We need to establish reliable prognostic and predictive factors to offer a tailored treatment. Several prognostic factors after metastasectomy have been identified: high C-reactive protein levels, a high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, elevated neutrophil count and low serum albumin are related to a worst outcome. Elevated CEA and Ki 67 levels, intrahepatic and perihepatic lymph node invasion are also some of the markers related to a worst outcome. In contrast, the administration of preoperative chemotherapy has been associated with a better prognosis after hepatectomy. The administration of adjuvant chemotherapy should be done taking in consideration these factors. Regarding predictive factors, determination of ERCC1, TS, TP and DPD and UGT1 polymorphisms assessment could be considered prior to chemotherapy administration. This would avoid treatment related toxicities and increase this population quality of life."}

Introduction. Follow-up surveillance after curative treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is recommended to detect early cancer recurrences and improve survival outcomes. However, a substantial proportion of CRC patients do not undergo cancer surveillance. Several demographic and disease-related factors have been associated with cancer surveillance adherence. Thus far, patient-centered communication has not been studied as a determinant for undergoing cancer surveillance. The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient-clinician information engagement (PCIE) influences patients' self-reported adherence to recommended CRC surveillance procedures. Methods. The study was a longitudinal survey among Pennsylvanian patients diagnosed with CRC in 2005. CRC patients who were eligible for surveillance and participated in both the baseline and 1-year follow-up surveys were included in this analysis (n = 305). The main outcome measure was self-reported adherence to physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen testing, and colonoscopy according to recommended guidelines. Results. Controlling for potential confounders, higher PCIE at baseline predicted a higher odds for CRC patients reporting adherence to recommended surveillance 1 year later by 2.8 times. Other significant predictors of adhering to recommended surveillance were a higher education level and having received systemic therapy. Discussion. In this longitudinal study among CRC patients who received curative treatment, greater patient engagement with clinicians about cancer-related information was found to improve patients' subsequent adherence to recommended surveillance. This finding provides support for encouraging greater patient-physician communication among CRC patients."}

A total of 96 patients (40 female, 56 male; mean age, 60.6 \u00b1 12 years) with a previous diagnosis of CRC underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT on suspicion of recurrence and were evaluated retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were accepted as the presence of increased serum CEA levels or positive findings on abdominal ceCT or both. 18F-FDG PET/CT findings were compared with histopathological findings and/or clinical follow-up data as the gold standard. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1, with increased CEA levels and normal abdominal ceCT; group 2, with normal CEA levels and positive ceCT; and group 3, with increased CEA levels and positive ceCT. Whereas sensitivities of CEA, ceCT, and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the three patient groups were calculated as 91, 67, and 96%, specificities were 13, 51, and 62%, respectively. There were 35, 14, and 46 patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The pathological diagnosis in 2003 was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with positive PALN metastasis in 3 of 4 dissected nodes (T3, N1b, M1a, stage IVa). At our hospital, chemoradiotherapy was started, with the radiation field determined from positron emission tomography (PET) images. Oral tegafur/uracil (600 mg/day) plus leucovorin (75 mg/day) therapy was also started. Radiotherapy (1.5 Gy/ fraction, total of 45 Gy) was completed in August 2005, while oral chemotherapy was discontinued 3 weeks after it was started due to diarrhea and epigastric discomfort. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was 193 ng/ml (N < 5) before treatment and decreased to within normal limits 3 months after initiation of chemoradiotherapy. Complete remission was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and PET in December 2005 and has continued for more than 6 years.

One hundred sixty three patients with rectal cancer were included in the study. Preoperative platelet count >350,000 was found in 8% of patients. Postoperative platelet count >350,000 was found in 6% of patients. Distant metastases were found in 17 patients (10.4%). Significant variables in the multivariate analyses were preoperative platelets >350,000 (p = 0.001), postoperative platelets >350,000 (p = 0.002), carcinoembryonic antigen >13 ng/dL (p = 0.003). Patients with preoperative platelet count <350,000 showed a 5-year survival rate of 81%, whereas patients with platelet count >350,000 had a 25-month survival [95% confidence interval (CI): 20-26]; p <0.001. Patients with postoperative platelets <350,000 showed a 5-year survival rate of 80%, whereas patients with platelets >350,000 showed a 3-year survival rate of 37.5% (p <0.05). Pre- or postoperative platelet count >350,000 is associated with poor survival in patients with rectal cancer. The measurement of platelets is a clinical marker useful to define the prognosis for patients with rectal cancer."}

The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical outcome and significance of mediastinal lymph node dissection (LND) during pulmonary resection of metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma. A retrospective chart review was performed. Between April 1985 and December 2009, 518 patients underwent 720 pulmonary metastasectomies for metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. Relevant factors were analyzed with the \u03c72 or Fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney test. Survival and lymph node (LN) recurrence-free period after pulmonary metastasectomy were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. The overall 5-year and 10-year survival rate after pulmonary metastasectomy were 47.1% and 27.7%, respectively. The only significant prognostic factor for survival after pulmonary metastasectomy was mediastinal LN metastasis (p=0.047 in univariate and 0.0028 in multivariate analysis); 199 patients did not undergo LND, 279 patients underwent LND that were negative, and 40 patients underwent LND that contained 1 or more positive mediastinal LN for metastases. The sensitivity of positron emission tomographic scan for detecting mediastinal LN metastases was only 35%. Although long-term survivors were present, systematic LND was not a significant factor for prolonged survival (p=0.26) in the positive LND group. Mediastinal LN metastases are a significant negative prognostic factor for survival after pulmonary metastasectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography based imaging, as well as preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels have poor sensitivity for detecting malignant mediastinal LN in this setting. Systematic mediastinal LND should be performed for prognostic purposes during pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal metastases."}

The guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network do not describe mucinous histology as a clinical factor that should influence the therapeutic algorithm. However, previous studies show conflicting results regarding the prognosis of colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma. In this study, we described the clinicopathological features of mucinous adenocarcinoma in Japan, to identify optimal therapeutic strategies. 144 patients with mucinous and 2673 with non-mucinous adenocarcinomas who underwent primary resection in two major centers in Yokohama, Japan were retrospectively evaluated for clinicopathological features and treatment factors. A multivariate analysis for overall survival followed by the comparison of overall survival using Cox proportional hazard model were performed. Patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma had larger primary lesions, higher preoperative CEA levels, a deeper depth of invasion, higher rates of nodal and distant metastasis, and more metastatic sites. A multivariate analysis for overall survival revealed a mucinous histology to be an independent prognostic factor. In the subgroup analysis stratified by stage, Patients diagnosed as stageIII and IV disease had a worse survival in mucinous adenocarcinoma than non-mucinous, while survival did not differ significantly in patients diagnosed as Stage0-II disease. In stageIII, local recurrence in rectal cases and peritoneal dissemination were more frequently observed in patients with a mucinous histology. Our study indentified that mucinous adenocarcinoma was associated with a worse survival compared with non-mucinous in patients with stageIII and IV disease. In rectal StageIII disease with mucinous histology, additional therapy to control local recurrence followed by surgical resection may be a strategical alternative. Further molecular investigations considering genetic features of mucinous histology will lead to drug development and better management of peritoneal metastasis."}

Here, we investigate the utility of human tissue kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6) mRNA as a progression biomarker to complement CEA mRNA, for improved selection of patients in need of adjuvant therapy and intensified follow-up after surgery. Lymph nodes of pTNM stage I-IV CRC- (166 patients/503 lymph nodes) and control (23/108) patients were collected at surgery and analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. Lymph node KLK6 positivity was an indicator of poor outcome (hazard ratio 3.7). Risk of recurrence and cancer death increased with KLK6 lymph node levels. Patients with KLK6 lymph node levels above the 90th percentile had a hazard ratio of 6.5 and 76 months shorter average survival time compared to patients with KLK6 negative nodes. The KLK6 positivity in lymph nodes with few tumour cells, that is, low CEA mRNA levels, also indicated poor prognosis (hazard ratio 2.8). In CRC patients, lymph node KLK6 positivity indicated presence of aggressive tumour cells associated with poor prognosis and high risk of tumour recurrence."}

We used the 1992 to 2007 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data to identify surgically treated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage III colon cancer patients. We used chi-square analyses and logistic regression to evaluate the association between adequate (\u226512) lymph node evaluation and receipt of postsurgical care (adjuvant chemotherapy, surveillance colonoscopy, CT scans, and CEA testing) and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate 10-year all-cause mortality, adjusting for postsurgical care. Among 17,906 surgically treated stage III colon cancer patients, adequate (\u226512) lymph node evaluation was not associated with receiving comprehensive postsurgical care after adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics (p > 0.05 for all). Initially, adequate lymph node evaluation was associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88; 95% CI [0.85 to 0.91]), but among 3-year survivors, the impact of adequate lymph node evaluation on lower mortality was diminished (HR 0.94; 95% CI [0.88 to 1.01]). However, receiving comprehensive postsurgical care was associated with continued lower mortality in 3-year survivors. Adequate lymph node evaluation for colon cancer was associated with lower mortality among all patients. However, among 3-year survivors, the association between lymph node evaluation and lower hazard of death was no longer significant, while postsurgical care remained strongly associated with lower long-term mortality, indicating that postsurgical care may partially explain the relationship between lymph node evaluation and mortality."}

This study evaluated the ability of (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging to predict early response to (90)Y-radioembolization in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) using RECIST and lesion density (Choi) criteria. Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with liver metastases at 2 years and decline in tumour markers were the primary end-points of the study. A total of 121 liver lesions were evaluated in 25 patients (14 men, 11 women) with liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT and CECT before and 6-8 weeks after treatment. Changes in SUV(max), tumour density measured in terms of Hounsfield units and the sum of the longest diameters (LD) were calculated for the target liver lesions in each patient. The patient responses to treatment were categorized using EORTC PET criteria, tumour density criteria (Hounsfield units) and RECIST, and were correlated with the responses of tumour markers and 2-year PFS using Kaplan-Meier plots and the log-rank test for comparison. Multivariate proportional hazards (Cox) regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of relevant prognostic factors on PFS. Using (18)F-FDG PET/CT response criteria, 15 patients had a partial response (PR) and 10 patients had stable disease (SD), while using RECIST only 2 patients had a PR and 23 had SD. Two patients had a PR, 21 SD and 2 progressive disease using tumour density criteria. The mean changes in SUV(max), sum of the LDs and tumour density after treatment were 2.9 \u00b1 2.6, 7.3 \u00b1 14.4 mm and 1.9 \u00b1 13.18 HU, respectively. Patients who had a PR on (18)F-FDG PET/CT had a mean decrease of 44.5 % in SUV(max) compared to those with SD who had a decrease of only 10.3 %. The decreases in SUV(max) and sum of the LDs were significant (p < 0.0001, p < 0.05, respectively) while the decrease in tumour density was not (p > 0.1065). The responses on the (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies were highly correlated with the responses of tumour markers (p < 0.0001 for LDH, p = 0.01 for CEA and p = 0.02 for Ca19-9), while the responses on the CECT studies using both RECIST and tumour density criteria were not significantly correlated with the responses of tumour markers. The responses on (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies also significantly predicted PFS (the median PFS in those with a PR was 12.0 months and in those with SD was 5 months, p < 0.0001), while RECIST and tumour density did not significantly predict PFS. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that responses on (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies and decreases in SUV(max) of \u2264 2.0 were the strongest predictors of PFS. Early response assessment to (90)Y-radioembolization using (18)F-FDG PET/CT is superior to RECIST and tumour density, demonstrating a correlation with tumour markers and significantly predicting PFS in patients with liver metastases. This could enable early response-adapted treatment strategies to be employed."}

Tumor recurrence of colorectal cancers (CRC) is generally followed up by analyses of the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. However, recent evidence suggests that tumor recurrence can also be visualized by 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in patients with normal CEA levels. We retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrence of CRC by comparing PET/CT performance in patients with normal CEA levels with PET/CT performance in patients with elevated CEA levels. A total of 235 patients with CRC who had been treated with surgery and/or chemotherapy/radiotherapy underwent PET/CT for the detection of tumor recurrence. The patients [96 females and 139 males; age (mean \u00b1 SD) 59.9 \u00b1 12.6 years; range 18-85] were divided into 2 groups based on whether their CEA levels were normal (<5 ng/ml) (Group 1, n = 118) or elevated (>5 ng/ml) (Group 2, n = 117). All of the patients had suspected recurrence based on raised CEA levels, clinical symptoms, and/or tumor detection using other imaging modalities. Of the 235 patients, 172 (73.1 %) had disease recurrence confirmed by a pathological examination (either biopsy or surgical exploration) or clinical follow-up studies. The FDG-PET/CT study yielded a true positive in detecting recurrence in 169 (71.9 %) patients, a true negative in 53 (22.5 %) patients, a false negative in 3 (1.2 %) patients and a false positive in 10 (4.2 %) patients. CRC recurrence was detected in 64.4 % (76/118) and 88 % (103/117) patients in Group 1 and Group 2 with FDG-PET/CT, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of the FDG-PET/CT study for establishing recurrence were 100, 84, 89.4, 100 and 93.2 %, respectively, for Group 1; by contrast, these parameters were 97.1, 84.6, 98, 78.5 and 95.7 %, respectively, for Group 2. The number of patients with hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases, such as lung and abdominal lymph node metastasis, detected with FDG-PET/CT was significantly different in Group 1 than in Group 2; however, the number of patients with local recurrence and peritoneal implants detected with FDG-PET/CT was not different between the two groups. FDG-PET/CT can accurately detect tumor recurrence in patients with suspected recurrent CRC, even for patients with normal CEA levels."}

Furthermore, courses of CYFRA 21-1, tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPS), M30-antigen, CEA and CA 19-9 were analyzed in prospectively collected sera of 15 patients with CRC during primary chemotherapy and were correlated with therapy response and overall survival (OS). Similar to CEA and CA 19-9, CYFRA 21-1 was significantly elevated in serum from patients with CRC (median 2.1 ng/ml) as compared with healthy (1.2 ng/ml; p<0.0001) and benign gastrointestinal controls (1.7 ng/ml; p=0.0178) and showed stage dependency in CRC (p=0.0118). CYFRA 21-1 correlated with CEA in benign diseases and CRC but not with CA 19-9. The best discrimination between healthy controls and patients with CRC was achieved by combination of CYFRA 21-1 and CA 19-9 (area under the curve; AUC=86.7%), while the combination of CEA and CA 19-9 discriminated best between benign diseases and CRC (AUC=73.9%). In CRC patients during primary chemotherapy, levels of cytokeratins CYFRA 21-1, TPA, TPS, CEA and CA 19-9 tended to be higher in patients with poor response to therapy and with poor prognosis.

While efficient surgical treatment is the key to prolonged survival of patients with colorectal cancer, post-surgical follow-up is important for the early detection of relapsing disease or of disease progression. Current dispensarization, typically based on imaging CT, PET, MR, is frequently supported by the observation of tumour markers (CEA, CA19-9). Due to their limited sensitivity and selectivity, better tools for monitoring of the disease are desirable. Tumour cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been recently demonstrated as a new promising molecular marker for observation and early detection of disease progression. We present results of post-surgical monitoring tumour cfDNA in the cases of seven patients suffering from advanced forms of CRC. We applied a mutation-based approach in which the total cfDNA was screened for a specific somatic mutation present in the primary tumour. We screened a panel of the most frequent somatic mutations covering the genes APC, KRAS, TP53, PIK3CA and BRAF. All patients were tested positive for tumour cfDNA prior to surgery. cfDNA was then evaluated within a week after surgery and subsequently in monthly intervals. We present typical cases of colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment at different levels of radicality with or without adjuvant chemo/biotherapy. The tumour cfDNA status was found to be always closely correlated with the actual clinical status of the patient. The cfDNA appears to be a viable tool for the monitoring of the clinical progression of CRC in patients with cfDNA positivity prior to surgery."}

We performed a retrospective analysis of 53 patients who underwent only hepatic resection or only RFA for colorectal liver metastases. Twenty-five patients who underwent hepatic resection were compared with 28 patients who underwent RFA for synchronous or metachronous liver metastases. The median CEA level at the time of diagnosis of liver metastases was significantly higher in the resection group (14.2 ng/mL vs. 2.8 ng/mL, p=0.002). The median size of main liver metastases was significantly larger in the resection group (4.0 cm vs. 2.05 cm, p=0.002). There was no difference in the percentage of patients experiencing major complication (one patient in each group). The marginal recurrence rate was significantly higher in the RFA group (p=0.004). Disease-free and overall survival were longer in the resection group (p=0.008 and 0.017, respectively). In multivariate analysis, only the type of treatment was a factor associated with disease-free and overall survival (p=0.004 and 0.007, respectively). Because of the high marginal recurrence rate, RFA shows an inferior outcome in comparison with surgical resection. Therefore, RFA should be considered for only selected patients with unresectable (by any means) disease or with high operative risk."}

Up to 30-50% of patients who undergo radical surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) develop tumor relapse. The aim of this study was to assess various surveillance protocols utilized in a tertiary referral hospital in Northern Italy. Data concerning 373 consecutive patients who underwent radical surgery for CRC between 1990 and 2006 and whose data had been entered into a prospective database were considered eligible for this study. The overall costs and the percentages of recurrence following the various surveillance protocols were calculated. One hundred two (27.35%) of the patients suffered a recurrence after a mean of 17.6 (95% CI 13.9-21.1) months. The combination of physical examination, colonoscopy, thorax-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) dosage was found to be the most cost/effective one to monitor stages I and II colon cancer; while physical examination, rigid sigmoidoscopy, thorax-abdominal CT scan, and serum CEA dosage were found to be the most cost/effective surveillance to monitor stages III and IV of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Adherence to follow-up guidelines and early detection are vital factors affecting the curability of relapsed cancer in CRC patients who undergo surgery. The first five years after surgery was found to be the most risky period for recurrence. Cost/effectiveness analysis indicate that follow-up protocols should be tailored to the risk of recurrence with the aim of identifying relapse when the disease is at an asymptomatic, presumably more curable stage."}

The prognostic factors after pulmonary resection in patients with colorectal pulmonary metastases remain controversial. The study aimed to identify the predicting factors for oncological outcomes after curative resection in patients with colorectal cancer and pulmonary metastases. This study is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. This study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital/referral center in South Korea. Between January 2000 and June 2010, 105 patients who developed pulmonary metastases after curative resection for colorectal cancer were enrolled. Forty-eight patients underwent pulmonary resection, and the remaining 58 were given chemotherapy and/or best supportive care. The primary outcomes measured were the predictive factors of survival and recurrence. During the 35.9-month median follow-up period, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 54.6% and 30.4%. On multivariate analysis, absence of adjuvant chemotherapy after pulmonary metastases (p = 0.003), presence of extrapulmonary metastases (p = 0.001), elevated prelaparotomy serum CEA level (p = 0.015), and absence of pulmonary resection (p = 0.048) were independent prognostic factors for poor overall survival. In patients who underwent pulmonary resection, the 3-year pulmonary recurrence-free survival rate was 78.3%. On multivariate analysis, elevated prelaparotomy serum CEA level (p = 0.018) and disease-free interval \u2264 12 months (p = 0.008) were independent risk factors associated with pulmonary re-recurrence after pulmonary resection. This study took place at a single institution and had a small sample size. Although we admit, to some degree, the benefits of the selection mechanism, pulmonary metastasectomy from colorectal cancer may improve survival after curative resection of colorectal cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy, extrapulmonary metastases, and prelaparotomy CEA value are independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Prelaparotomy serum CEA level may be an especially reliable predictor of both overall survival and recurrence-free survival after pulmonary metastasectomy in patients who undergo curative resection for colorectal cancer."}

To investigate whether the plasma levels of cell-free RNA (cfRNA) and telomere-specific reverse transcriptase mRNA (hTERT) are associated with tumor response in rectal cancer patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (pCRT). Patients who underwent pCRT for rectal cancer and for whom baseline and paired post-pCRT blood samples were available were studied. On the basis of tumor regression score, patients were classified as having response or having no response. Clinical variables and plasma levels of cfRNA and hTERT before and after the pCRT were evaluated. The association between each predictor and tumor response was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Of 98 eligible patients, 45 were determined to respond to therapy, and 53 did not respond to therapy. In univariate analysis, gender (P = 0.040), baseline levels of cfRNA (P = 0.026), post-pCRT levels of both hTERT and cfRNA (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.001, respectively), and the difference between the post- and pre-pCRT levels of both hTERT and cfRNA (P = 0.009 and P = 0.001, respectively) were found to be significant predictors of tumor response. In multivariate analysis, using variables that were available before pCRT, cfRNA levels and gender independently predicted the tumor response, while in multivariate analysis, which used all of the variables available before the surgical procedure, the post-pCRT levels of cfRNA and the difference between the post- and pre-pCRT levels of cfRNA independently predicted tumor response. Plasma levels of cfRNA and hTERT are promising markers of tumor response to pCRT for rectal cancer."}

The present paper is a first evaluation of the use of \"CEAwatch\", a clinical support software system for surgeons for the follow-up of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. This system gathers Carcino-Embryonic Antigen (CEA) values and automatically returns a recommendation based on the latest values. Consecutive patients receiving follow-up care for CRC fulfilling our in- and exclusion criteria were identified to participate in this study. From August 2008, when the software was introduced, patients were asked to undergo the software-supported follow-up. Safety of the follow-up, experiences of working with the software, and technical issues were analyzed. 245 patients were identified. The software-supported group contained 184 patients; the control group contained 61 patients. The software was safe in finding the same amount of recurrent disease with fewer outpatient visits, and revealed few technical problems. Clinicians experienced a decrease in follow-up workload of up to 50% with high adherence to the follow-up scheme. CEAwatch is an efficient software tool helping clinicians working with large numbers of follow-up patients. The number of outpatient visits can safely be reduced, thus significantly decreasing workload for clinicians."}

Patients who had a previous diagnosis of CRC were searched retrospectively in our PET center database. Seventy-six 18F-FDG PET/CT studies between October 2006 and December 2010 of 69 patients (25 women, 44 men; mean age: 61.61 \u00b1 4.1 years) with elevated CEA levels were evaluated. 18F-FDG PET/CT findings and concurrent abdominopelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ceCT) findings were compared with histopathological findings and/or clinical follow-up data as the 'gold standard'. In the patient-based analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of disease recurrence were calculated as 97 and 61%, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found in frequencies of positive and negative 18F-FDG PET/CT findings between patients with or without recurrent disease by gold standard (P<0.05). There was no correlation between patients' serum CEA levels and lesions' maximum standardized uptake values (P=0.85). The sensitivity and specificity of ceCT were computed as 51 and 60%, respectively. In the evaluation of separate patient groups, although the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT were calculated as 100 and 60% in the group whose CEA level elevation was less than two-fold (5-9.9 ng/ml), these were 100 and 75% in the group with CEA elevation less than three-fold (10-14.9 ng/ml) and 95 and 62% in the group with elevation more than three-fold (\u2265 15 ng/ml). The sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT were computed as 98 and 85% in the lesion-based evaluation. The sensitivity and specificity of ceCT were 73 and 86%, respectively. 18F-FDG PET/CT is a safe imaging method that can be used in the determination of CRC recurrence in patients with elevated CEA levels, regardless of the CEA level."}

CTCs of twelve consecutive patients with K-ras wild type colorectal cancer with synchronous and/or metachronous unresectable metastatic lesions were measured by the cell search system between January 2009 and December 2010. CTCs were measured before and after chemotherapy. The regimen consisted of four courses (three months) of SOX (TS-1+L-OHP) + panitumumab. Four patients (33%) had no detectable CTCs before chemotherapy. For these patients, no CTCs were detected after chemotherapy and their serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels decreased after chemotherapy. Four of the other eight patients with positive CTCs had no detectable CTCs after chemotherapy and their serum CEA levels decreased after chemotherapy. The other four of eight patients with positive CTCs continued to have CTCs after chemotherapy and all four patients died of cancer within eight months after starting chemotherapy.

A total of 100 patients underwent nCRT and had baseline and posttreatment CEA levels recorded within 6 months of surgery. The median radiotherapy dose was 50.4 Gy. Eighty-six patients received adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Prognostic factors were analyzed for possible associations with freedom from failure (FFF) by univariate and multivariate analyses. Median follow-up was 30 months. The median CEA (ng/ml) levels at baseline before nCRT, after nCRT, and after total mesorectal excision were 3.6, 1.7, and 1.3, respectively. Pathologic complete response was observed in 22%. FFF at 36 months was 78%. Local failure and distant failure occurred in 4 and 20% of the patients, respectively. On univariate analysis, pathologic complete response, margin status, and both pretreatment and postsurgery CEA levels were associated with recurrence (all P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, pathologic complete response (P < 0.007), margin status (P < 0.001), and postsurgery CEA level (P = 0.003), but not baseline CEA level (P = 0.2), were found to be associated with recurrence. After nCRT for rectal cancer, postsurgery CEA level may have more prognostic value than pretreatment level.

Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative serum CEA level was a significant independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (hazard ratio: 6.49, 95% CI, 3.09 to 13.62, p < 0.0001). Preoperative serum CEA is a reliable predictor factor for recurrence in patients with CRC. CEA might be used in staging system and will be useful for therapeutic orientation in patients undergoing curative resection of CRC."}

To investigate the outcomes of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) after simultaneous surgical resection in rectal cancer patients with liver metastases (LM). One hundred and eight patients receiving total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer and surgical resection for LM were reviewed. Forty-eight patients received adjuvant CRT, and 60 were administered CT alone. Recurrence patterns and prognosis were analyzed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were compared between the CRT and CT groups. The inverse probability of the treatment-weighted (IPTW) method based on the propensity score was used to adjust for selection bias between the two groups. At a median follow-up period of 47.7 months, 77 (71.3%) patients had developed recurrences. The majority of recurrences (68.8%) occurred in distant organs. By contrast, the local recurrence rate was only 4.7%. Median DFS and OS were not significantly different between the CRT and CT groups. After applying the IPTW method, we observed no significant differences in terms of DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.347; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.759-2.392; p = 0.309) and OS (HR, 1.413; CI, 0.752-2.653; p = 0.282). Multivariate analyses showed that unilobar distribution of LM and normal preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level (<6 mg/mL) were significantly associated with longer DFS and OS. The local recurrence rate after simultaneous resection of rectal cancer with LM was relatively low. DFS and OS rates were not different between the adjuvant CRT and CT groups. Adjuvant CRT may have a limited role in this setting. Further prospective randomized studies are required to evaluate optimal adjuvant treatment in these patients."}

Patients with unresectable mCRC with liver metastases treated at The Ohio State University were included in this analysis. Demographic data, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values, observed toxicities, and information on prior therapies were collected. Response was assessed by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 criteria. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Twenty-four patients (median age, 63 years) were included. Of the patients, 54% had extrahepatic disease; 67% had bilobar involvement. The patients had received a median of 3 prior therapies. No objective responses were observed. Five patients had a CEA response. Median PFS and OS were 3.9 months (95% CI, 2.4-4.8 months) and 8.9 months (95% CI, 4.2-16.7 months), respectively. Patients older than 65 years had improved PFS (4.6 vs. 2.4 months) and OS (14 vs. 5.5 months) vs. younger patients, likely due to receipt of (90)Y treatment earlier in their disease course. The presence of extrahepatic disease and the absence of CEA response appeared negatively predictive of efficacy. Toxicities were expected and manageable. (90)Y radioembolization is active in select patients with refractory mCRC and with liver metastases, and is safe and well tolerated in the elderly.

CEA and CK20 mRNA levels were quantified using a real-time qRT-PCR system. For gastric carcinoma the FPTC positivity rate acquired by cytology, immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR was 14.8%, 14.8%, and 78% and for colorectal carcinoma was 0%, 17%, and 42%, respectively. qRT-PCR positivity was correlated with a poor cancer-specific survival and time-to-recurrence rates in both gastric and colorectal carcinoma. Epithelial immunoenrichment and immunofluorescence analysis allows unequivocal identification of the FPTC. The real time qRT-PCR showed higher sensitivity for the detection of CEA and CK20 mRNA levels and confirmed its prognostic value in gastrointestinal cancers."}

To evaluate whether CRC promotes Treg activity and how this influences anti-tumour immune responses and disease progression. A longitudinal study of Treg activity on a cohort of patients was performed before and after tumour resection. Specific CD4(+) T cell responses were also measured to the tumour associated antigens carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 5T4. Tregs from 62 preoperative CRC patients expressed a highly significant increase in levels of Foxp3 compared to healthy age-matched controls (p=0.007), which returned to normal after surgery (p=0.0075). CD4(+) T cell responses to one or both of the tumour associated antigens, CEA and 5T4, were observed in approximately two-thirds of patients and one third of these responses were suppressed by Tregs. Strikingly, in all patients with tumour recurrence at 12 months, significant preoperative suppression was observed of tumour-specific (p=0.003) but not control CD4(+) T cell responses. These findings demonstrate that the presence of CRC drives the activity of Tregs and accompanying suppression of CD4(+) T cell responses to tumour-associated antigens. Suppression is associated with recurrence of tumour at 12 months, implying that Tregs contribute to disease progression. These findings offer a rationale for the manipulation of Tregs for therapeutic intervention."}

Preoperatively and at follow-ups, we did flow-based phenotyping, examined antitumor immunity using peptides from carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) protein in the presence or absence of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(dim/-) cells (Tregs) and determined cytokine and PGE(2) levels in patient blood samples. At 18 months post-surgery, 8 patients were disease free (7 alive and 1 dead of unrelated cause) and 10 had experienced disease recurrence (7 alive and 3 dead of metCRC). Prior to surgery, the patients demonstrated Treg-mediated suppression of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 expression that could be perturbed through the PGE(2)/cAMP pathway and the immune suppression was significantly higher in the group that later developed disease recurrence (P = 0.046). Furthermore, the post-surgery plasma PGE(2) levels were related to the clinical outcome (PGE(2) levels of 280 \u00b1 47 vs. 704 \u00b1 153 pg/ml (mean \u00b1 SEM) for disease free and recurrent disease, respectively). T-cell phenotyping revealed higher frequencies of COX-2(+) cells in the patients with recurrent disease. These findings support the notion that the level of Treg-mediated suppression of adaptive antitumor immune responses at the time of surgery may influence later clinical outcome of metCRC and provide valuable prognostic information."}

Of 490 colorectal cancer patients accessible for Topo II\u03b1 expression, expression of Topo II\u03b1 was scored as (-) in 4 (0.8%) patients, (+) in 41 (8.4%) patients, (++) in 396 (80.8%) patients, and (+++) in 49 (10.0%) patients. Overexpression of Topo II\u03b1 was found to be related with lower T stage (p\u2009=\u20090.042), lower N stage (p\u2009=\u20090.038), and a lower incidence of recurrence with nearly significance (p\u2009=\u20090.053). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that overexpression of Topo II\u03b1 was related with prolonged overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.022) and disease-free survival (p\u2009=\u20090.036). Multivariate analyses showed that elevated serum CEA (p\u2009<\u20090.001), elevated serum CA199 (p\u2009=\u20090.002), poor differentiation (p\u2009=\u20090.001), advanced Dukes stage (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and lower expression of Topo II\u03b1 (p\u2009=\u20090.017) were independent predictive factors for poor prognosis. Topo II\u03b1 expression is a valuable prognostic indicator for colorectal cancer and would be useful in treatment selection for early colorectal cancer and malignant colorectal polyps resected under endoscopy, especially when it is used in combination with serum CEA, CA199, and differentiation."}

The prognostic role of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colorectal cancer patients with normal preoperative level is questionable. We evaluate the perioperative change of serum CEA to elucidate its prognostic effect in these patients. We reviewed patients who received curative resection of colorectal cancer during 2000 and 2004 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. The serum CEA level at diagnosis and one month after curative surgery were recorded. Levels higher than 5ng/mL were defined as abnormal. We divided patients with normal preoperative CEA level into two groups depending on the perioperative change. They were analyzed with clinicopathological factors and disease free survival rate. In patients with stage I to III colorectal cancer, there were 738 patients with normal preoperative CEA level (55.7%). Patients with increased post-operative CEA than pre-operative ones had higher percentage of colon cancer (p=0.007) and more lymphovascular invasion (p=0.038). Besides they also had higher disease recurrent rate (p=0.032) and worse disease-free survival (p=0.019). In multivariate analysis, perioperative CEA change, lymph node metastasis and tumor invasion depth remained independent prognostic factors (p=0.015). When preoperative CEA level is normal, perioperative change is a prognostic factor of colorectal cancer."}

Fucosylation is a crucial oligosaccharide modification in cancer and inflammation. Total cellular proteins of cancer cells and the sera of patients with cancer both show increased fucosylation levels. Certain kinds of fucosylated proteins can be applied as novel cancer biomarkers in glyco-proteomic analyses. We previously identified fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt) as a serologic marker for pancreatic cancer, and recently developed a lectin-antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for quantifying Fuc-Hpt. In the present study, we investigated the clinical outcome of Fuc-Hpt levels in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), and examined the mechanisms underlying Fut-Hpt production using a murine tumor transplantation model. The relationship between Fuc-Hpt levels and clinical parameters was investigated in 77 patients with CRC, all of whom underwent primary resection. Serum Fuc-Hpt levels were examined in athymic nude mice injected with colon cancer cell lines that lacked fucosylation. Fuc-Hpt levels were significantly associated with overall and relapse-free survival, distant metastasis, clinical stage, and curability. Multivariate analysis revealed that distant metastasis was an independent factor for increased Fuc-Hpt levels. The combination of Fuc-Hpt and CEA might be a better serologic marker to predict prognosis. Fuc-Hpt levels were higher in mice with direct injection of tumor cells into the spleen than in those injected subcutaneously. Fuc-Hpt might be a useful marker for the prognosis of CRC. Fuc-Hpt could be produced by the tissue surrounding tumor cells, which might be the mechanism underlying Fuc-Hpt elevation associated with distant metastasis."}

This study was designed to identify the significance of lymphovascular invasion as a prognosticator for tumor recurrence and survival in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and total mesorectal excision (TME). Between January 2003 and October 2010, the study included 328 patients with primary rectal cancer who had received preoperative CRT followed by TME. We analyzed the clinicopathologic factors that may be associated with survival, such as age, gender, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) value, pathologic T and N stage, tumor response, histologic grade, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion. Higher pathologic T and N stage, poor tumor response, high-grade histology, and positive LVI were adverse prognostic factors for both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) on the multivariate analysis. Perineural invasion was a significant adverse prognostic factor affecting DFS (P=0.046) but not OS (P=0.08). Increased T and N stage and distant recurrence, but not local recurrence, were significant factors associated with LVI. The LVI-negative group had a higher DFS (71.4 vs. 56.2%, P=0.012) and OS rate (86.7 vs. 63.4%, P=0.020) at 5 years than the LVI-positive group did. Positive LVI had a negative impact on survival in patients with rectal cancer who received preoperative CRT and TME and is significantly associated with an increased chance of distant recurrence. Based on this finding, more tailored adjuvant chemotherapy is warranted for advanced rectal cancer patients with LVI to reduce the distant dissemination of tumor."}

Ablative therapies may extend this. This study reports a single institution's long-term experience with hepatic cryotherapy for advanced CLM. Between April 1990 and June 2009, 304 patients were curatively treated with cryotherapy. Survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors for survivals were determined by using univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 293 patients were included into analysis. The median number of lesions treated per patient was three (range, 1-13). The median overall survival was 29 (range, 3-220) months. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survivals were 87%, 41.8%, 24.2%, and 13.3%, respectively. A total of 161 patients developed intrahepatic recurrences: cryosite (23%); edge recurrence (14%); and within the liver remnant (78%). The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 9 (range, 1-220) months. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year DFS rates were 37.9%, 17.2%, 13.4%, and 10.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified four factors that significantly affect survival: node-positive primary tumor (p=0.001), preoperative CEA level (p<0.001), number of lesions (p<0.001), and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p<0.001). However, only primary tumor nodal status was independently prognostic (hazards ratio=2.023; 95% confidence interval, 1.444-2.835; p<0.001). Hepatic cryotherapy seems to be a safe and effective ablative technique for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases and may offer long-term survival in otherwise unresectable disease."}

While several prognostic models have been developed to predict survival of patients who undergo hepatectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), few data exist to predict survival after recurrence. We sought to develop a model that predicts survival for patients who have developed recurrence following hepatectomy for mCRC. A retrospective analysis was performed on data from consecutive patients that underwent hepatectomy for mCRC. Clinicopathologic data, recurrence patterns, and outcomes were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. An integer-based model was created to predict the patterns of recurrence and survival after recurrence. This analysis included 280 patients with a median follow-up of 50.1\u00a0months. Of these, 53% underwent major hepatectomy and 87% had negative margins. Recurrent disease developed in 63% of patients. After hepatectomy, factors associated with short disease-free interval (DFI) and overall survival (OS) included CEA\u00a0>\u00a0200\u00a0ng/ml (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0005),\u00a0>1 metastasis (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0005), and a high Fong score (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0005). After recurrence, the pattern of recurrence was a strong predictor of OS (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0005).

A simple predictive scoring system was developed from the beta coefficients of this analysis that correlated with recurrence pattern (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0005). After hepatectomy, survival of patients with recurrent mCRC is strongly predicted by the patterns of recurrence, and the recurrence pattern can be predicted with a simple model. This can also be extended to create a scoring system that estimates expected survival."}

Clinical and treatment variables of patients undergoing RFA were collected, and their association with survival was examined. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. RFA was performed as concomitant sequential treatment of extrahepatic pulmonary metastases after hepatectomy in 19 patients (30%) and as salvage treatment for pulmonary recurrences after hepatectomy in 45 patients (70%). Patients undergoing sequential treatment had a median survival of 31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.8-40.6) months compared to 59 (95% CI 35.0-82.0) months in the salvage treatment group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.142).

The DFS and OS of patients undergoing sequential RFA of extrahepatic pulmonary metastases after hepatectomy appeared shorter when compared to patients who underwent RFA as salvage treatment for pulmonary recurrences after hepatectomy. It nonetheless remains better than the historical results of chemotherapy alone and thus supports the use of RFA as an ablative technology to achieve tumor control."}

Lymph nodes were collected at surgery and bisected; one half was subjected to biomarker mRNA analysis using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and the other half to routine histopathology. Lymph nodes from 174 CRC patients and 24 controls were analyzed. The median follow-up time was 59 (range 17-131) months. Cut-off levels were defined by analyzing quintiles by Cox regression model. CEA mRNA showed the best discriminating power between patients with recurrence in CRC after surgery and patients who were apparently disease-free (p = 0.015). The risk of recurrence for the CEA(+) patients was 4.6 times greater than for the CEA(-) patients (p < 0.0001). The other biomarkers gave lower hazard ratios. Cumulative survival analysis demonstrated that the average survival time was 99 months for CEA(-) patients compared to 39 months for CEA(+) patients, a difference of 60 months (p < 0.0001). Six to nine percent of the Stage I and Stage II patients [H&E(-)] had CEA(+), CK20(+), GCC(+) and/or MUC2(+) lymph nodes. Two of these patients died from recurrent CRC. Low lymph node MUC2/CEA mRNA ratio identified patients with high risk for recurrence (p = 0.011). Thus, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of CEA mRNA is a sensitive method to identify tumor cells in lymph nodes of CRC patients and, in combination with MUC2 mRNA, allows improved prediction of clinical outcome."}

Preoperative serum CA19-9 and CA242 concentrations were detected by C12 protein chip diagnostic system in 185 patients with CRC, and informative data were collected during 5-year follow-up periods. The value of CA19-9 and CA242 in diagnosis and prognosis for 5-year RFS as well as their consistencies and correlations were comparatively analyzed. The sensitivities of CA19-9 and CA242 were only 19.5 and 20%, respectively; the efficiencies of two TMs were 53.9 and 54.2%, respectively; and two TMs increased significantly with advancing clinical stages (P < 0.0001). Preoperative CA19-9 and CA242 levels correlated with stage (r, 0.411 and 0.408) and CEA concentration (r, 0.553 and 0.630). The concentrations of two TMs closely correlated with each other (r = 0.829), and two TMs had a very strong consistency in diagnosis (\u03ba = 0.931). Among 88 of 185 cases with complete follow-up information on RFS, patients with positive preoperative serum CA19-9 or CA242 had higher 5-year recurrent rates (72.2% vs. 44.3%, P = 0.034; 76.5% vs. 43.7%, P = 0.015) and reduced median RFS (14 vs. 36 months, 12 vs. 36 months) compared with those with negative TMs. The consistency of predicting prognosis for RFS of two TMs was extremely strong (\u03ba = 0.964). ROC curves analysis showed that CA242 test performed better than CA19-9 test (AUC, 0.648 vs. 0.605). Univariate analysis showed that preoperative serum status of both TMs was correlated with 5-year RFS (P < 0.05), whereas multivariate Cox regression model analysis revealed that none of them were independent prognostic factors for RFS. Both CA19-9 and CA242 had strong consistencies in diagnosis and prognosis for predicting 5-year RFS. CA242 demonstrated superior value to CA19-9 in CRC."}

Patients were treated with bevacizumab in combination with FOLFIRI-3 every 14 days. The association between treatment efficacy and visceral fat area as measured by CT scan or Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) change after 2 months was also studied. Forty-nine consecutive patients were treated. Four hundred and twenty four cycles of chemotherapy were delivered. Median follow-up was 11 months. Eleven patients (22.4%) had an objective partial response and 26 (53.1%) were stabilized. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7 and 13 months respectively. Four grade 4 adverse events occurred (1 digestive perforation, 1 rectal ulcer, 1 pulmonary embolism, and 1 febrile aplasia) but no toxic death was observed. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 18 patients (38%) including asthenia in 15 patients (30%), nausea and vomiting in 4 patients (8%), diarrhea in 11 patients (22%), anemia in 4 patients (8%), neutropenia in 10 patients (20%) and thrombopenia in 4 patients (8%). Visceral Fat area was significantly lower in responder patients. CEA change at 2 months predicted improved overall survival.

The ability of microfluidic chip to capture CTCs from PBS and whole blood samples was tested. Sixty-eight peripheral blood samples from 68 colorectal cancer patients were investigated for the presence of CTCs by microchip technology. The frequency of CTCs was analyzed statistically for correlation with relevant clinical data. We also examined samples from 20 healthy individuals as controls. The calculated capture efficiency was 85.7% and decreased significantly at flow rates above 2.0 ml/h. The number of CTCs isolated ranged from 3 to 236/ml for colorectal patients [99 +/- 64 (mean +/- SD) CTCs/ml]. None of the 20 healthy subjects had any identifiable CTCs. We identified CTCs in 46 (67.65%) of the 68 patients: in two of nine (22.22%) Dukes A, in 10 of 24 (41.67%) Dukes B, in 21 of 22 (95.45%) Dukes C, and in all 13 Dukes D patients. The detection rate in Dukes C and D patients was much higher than in Dukes A and B patients (97.73% vs. 36.36%) (p < 0.01).

We were experienced a case of transverse colon cancer without a recurrence lesion after five years from the resection of hepatic metastasis. A case was a 77-year-old man. He was operated against transverse colon cancer in February 2003. Pathological stage was ss, n0, Stage II. In April 2004, serum CEA was increased. CT examination was not detected a hepatic metastasis but ultrasound examination and MRI detected the metastasis at S7 lesion in the liver. In July 2004, he was admitted to S-1 and PSK until October 2004. In December 2004, the lesion of hepatic metastasis was reduced and serum CEA was decreased. But in September 2005, the metastatic lesion was re-grown. A resection for hepatic metastasis was executed in November 2005. After the resection for hepatic metastasis, he was admitted to UFT/ UZEL from January 2006 to October 2006. Present time( June 2011), the lesion of recurrence was not detected by several examinations (CT, MRI, Ultrasound etc)."}

There is always a certain rate of recurrence after radical treatment for cancer and to get on it an early detection of disease set back is crucial. Medical data of patients operated on for primarily detected colorectal cancer in years 1993-2002 was retrospectively reviewed. Usefulness of follow-up means such as physical examination, or CEA and endoscopic surveillance was analyzed. All mentioned above were applied to scheduled follow-up (in 3, 6 and 12 month intervals following an operation and annually after that by the year 5). Complete and reliable data was obtained from 340 out of 502 follow-up intended subjects (67.7%). Elevated CEA was the most frequent predictor of recurrence within non-symptomatic subjects meeting follow-up appointments (60%). The cancer set back diagnosed by means of either physical or endoscopic examinations was the case only in one out of five patients (20.75% and 18.87% respectively). Clinical onset of recurrence making patients meet an unscheduled appointment was found increasing relative risk of nothing-but-palliative option either for them with local set back, or meta-static spread. Relative risk of onset of meta-chronous colonic cancer was significantly higher in patients being affected by synchronous advanced adenoma at time of surgery compared to those with one-fold changes. CEA scheduled follow-up after treatment for colorectal cancer CRC seems adequate to provide a good outcome of treatment for recurrent tumors. CRC patients presenting with synchronous advanced adenomas at time of surgery are probably to be under more intensive endoscopic surveillance."}

Recognition of the commonly encountered colorectal cancer (CRC) generally begins and takes place because of and based on symptoms and signs, due to the unsettled screening of this type of cancer. Sometimes, because of advanced stage cancer urgent surgical intervention could become necessary and, if this is the case, there is no time and possibility for searching for an eventual second tumor and perhaps the patient's status does not permit performing intraoperative investigations either. The incidence of multiple colon cancer is considered to be between 2.5 and 30% according to the literature. That is why one should exclude them even in the absence of pre- and intraoperative investigations and complaints. On the other hand, colonoscopy and perhaps irrigoscopy of seemingly healthy followed-up patients is mandatory. In the case of the presence of complaints/symptoms denoting impaired intestinal passage seen in a followed-up patient or during the adjuvant setting or metastatic/recurrent disease, treatment and even during hospice care we should evaluate the possibility of a second metachronous tumor. Moreover, if there is no urgency, the multidisciplinary team (oncoteam) should recommend the adequate treatment by balancing gain/utility and risk."}

We performed continuous dendritic cells (DCs) vaccination to treat a patient with chemotherapy-resistant recurrent rectal carcinoma and lung and bone metastases. A patient has received a total of 66 DC vaccinations at 14-day intervals for 3 years until his death. Necrotic whole tumor cells (WTC) were selected as the tumor-associated antigen source because they showed a greater capacity for DC maturation and interleukin-12 secretion than both necrotic tumor lysate alone and necrotic tumor cell fragment alone. After the sixth vaccination, both skin test and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) response by peripheral blood T-cells to WTC-pulsed DCs were positive. Importantly, T-cell responses were positive towards DCs pulsed with several synthetic peptides including Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Melanoma associated antigen (MAGE)1 and MAGE3. A biopsy specimen collected from the pelvic bone metastasis after the 6th vaccination showed marked necrotic change of the carcinoma cells, with many infiltrating mononuclear cells. The patient did not show any particular adverse reactions to vaccination such as autoimmune phenomena. Our experience of this case suggests that continuous long-term vaccination with autologous WTC-pulsed DCs can elicit in vivo T-cell response against multiple tumor-associated antigens and induce tumor regression in disease that has proven resistant to intensive chemo- or radiation therapy."}

The potential benefit of adjuvant hepatic arterial infusional floxuridine (HAI-FUDR) in addition to modern systemic chemotherapy using oxaliplatin or irinotecan remains unknown for patients with resected liver-confined colorectal metastases (CRLM). The principle aim of this study was to compare outcomes in patients receiving modern systemic chemotherapy with or without HAI-FUDR. Between 2000 and 2005, 125 patients underwent resection of CRLM followed by adjuvant HAI-FUDR plus dexamethasone (Dex) and concurrent systemic chemotherapy including oxaliplatin or irinotecan. These patients were compared retrospectively to 125 consecutive patients who received modern systemic chemotherapy alone after liver resection. The median follow-up for all patients was 43 months. There were no differences in clinical risk score, disease-free interval, size of largest CRLM, number of CRLM, or prehepatectomy CEA level between the 2 groups. Adjuvant HAI-FUDR was associated with an improved overall and liver recurrence-free survival (liver RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). For the adjuvant HAI-FUDR group, the 5-year liver RFS, overall RFS, and DSS were 75%, 48%, and 79%, respectively, compared to 55%, 25%, and 55% for the systemic alone group (P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, adjuvant treatment including HAI-FUDR was independently associated with improved liver RFS (HR = 0.34), overall RFS (HR = 0.65), and DSS (HR = 0.39), P < 0.01. Adjuvant HAI-FUDR combined with modern systemic chemotherapy is independently associated with improved survival compared to adjuvant systemic chemotherapy alone. A randomized clinical trial between these 2 regimens is justified."}

The correlation between the mRNA expression of CEA, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in tissue samples and preoperative serum levels of the named tumour markers was performed on 27 patients. The scoring system was proposed as a combination of all the independent parameters (mRNA expression of TIMP-1, MMP-9 and CEA in tumour tissue samples and preoperative serum levels of CEA and TIMP-1) in combination with the volume of the metastatic process. The evaluation was conducted in relation to the disease free interval (DFI). We observed a statistically significant relationship between the volume of liver metastases and DFI (p<0.0337). The scoring system divided the patients into groups with a tendency of early recurrence (p<0.0126). The high stages in our scoring systems augment the risk of recurrence. The proposed scoring system was shown to be an efficient instrument helpful in complex surgical and oncological access to patients after radical surgical treatment of CLM."}

The aim of the present study was to determine the accuracy of yearly postoperative monitoring of serum tumor markers to either detect or rule out recurrence in colorectal cancer patients. A total of 127 colorectal cancer patients who underwent curative surgery were enrolled. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were assayed, and radiological examinations were performed routinely for 5 years after surgery or until recurrence was detected. Yearly recurrence rates (number of recurrences/number of patients assessed in a given year), sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios were calculated. Post-test probabilities were calculated from these values. Recurrences tended to show almost the same frequencies in the first and second year after surgery (20 of 127 patients and 18 of 107 patients, respectively). However, the post-test probability of recurrence in patients with positive and negative serum CEA levels was significantly lower in the second year than in the first year (test positive: 40.0% and 76.0%; test negative: 9.3% and 0.5%, respectively). Measuring CEA can help to identify patients likely to demonstrate recurrence with high accuracy only within the first year after surgery. Another examination, such as imaging, is therefore necessary for monitoring patients at 2 or more years after surgery."}

This article discusses the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a facilitator of the inflammatory response and its effect on colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis. Colorectal cancer accounts for 11% of all cancers in the United States and the majority of deaths are associated with liver metastasis. If left untreated, median survival is only six to 12\u00a0months. Resection of liver metastases offers the only chance for cure. Of the small number of patients who have operable cancer most will have further tumor recurrence. The molecular mechanisms associated with colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver are largely unknown. However CEA production has been shown both clinically and experimentally to be a factor in an increased metastatic potential of colorectal cancers to the liver. CEA also has a role in protecting tumor cells from the effects of anoikis and this affords a selective advantage for tumor cell survival in the circulation. CEA acts in the liver through its interaction with its receptor (CEAR), a protein that is related to the hnRNP M family of RNA binding proteins. In the liver CEA binds with hnRNP M on Kupffer cells and causes activation and production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. These cytokines affect the up-regulation of adhesion molecules on the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium and protect the tumor cells against cytotoxicity by nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive oxygen radicals. HnRNP M signaling in Kupffer cells appears to be controlled by beta-adrenergic receptor activation. The cells will respond to the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline resulting in reduced TNF-\u03b1 and increased IL-10 and IL-6 production following CEA activation. This has implications for the control of tumor cell implantation and survival in the liver."}

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common malignancies worldwide. Understanding CRC prognosis at the initial diagnosis is very important for therapeutic strategy selection. This study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) for predicting 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) in CRC patients. Preoperative serum CA19-9, CEA and CA125 levels were detected by C12 protein chip diagnostic system in 103 patients with CRC, and their correlations with the 5-year RFS were analyzed. Patients with positive preoperative serum CA19-9, CEA and CA125 had higher 5-year recurrent rates (75.0% vs 41.0%, 65.6% vs 39.4%, and 87.5% vs 44.2% respectively, all p< (o)0.05), and reduced median RFS (14 vs 35 months, 20 vs 36 months, and 4 vs 35 months respectively, all p< (o)0.05) compared with patients negative for corresponding tumor marker (TM). The median RFS was 59 months (95% CI 28.9-89.1 months) with negative TMs, 14 months (95% CI 4.5-23.5) for 1~2 positive TMs, and 4 months (95% CI 2.4-5.6) for all 3 positive TMs. Patients with simultaneously positive serum CA19-9, CEA and CA125 had the highest recurrence rate (100%) and the shortest RFS (median 4 months). Univariate analysis showed that stage and the preoperative single TM or combined TMs correlated with RFS, whereas multivariate Cox regression model analysis revealed only stage and preoperative serum status of CEA+CA19-9+CA125 to be independent prognostic factors. Preoperative serum CA19-9+CEA+CA125 can be used an independent prognostic factor for CRC 5-year RFS."}

Anti-CEA immuno globulin (Ig)G or IgM was detected by immunonephelometry in 44 (63.8%) patients with colorectal cancer, three (10.7%) with benign intestinal conditions and four (10.8%) healthy blood donors. Differences in antibody detection frequencies between the cancer patient group and the control groups were statistically significant. Titres of anti-CEA correlated significantly with CEA levels and Dukes' cancer stage. Antibody titre was an independent, significant, favourable predictor for 5-year recurrence-free survival.

Mean age, tumor location, TNM staging at diagnosis, T-stage, N-stage, preoperative CEA level and recurrent rate of MA patients were compared with those of NMA patients. The distribution of MA patients for gender, mean age, tumor location, TNM stage and preoperative CEA level were similar to those of NMA patients (all p > 0.05). Only the tumor recurrence in MA was significantly more common than that in NMA (p = 0.020, OR = 3.28 (1.14-9.43)), whereas the TNM stage was not significantly different from NMA (p = 0.530). The metastatic site and pattern of metastasis also showed no statistical significance (p = 0.125). The prognosis of MA is poorer than NMA. This may be associated with mucinous histological type itself."}

The way to select patients who will benefit from surgical resection of pulmonary metastases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remains unclear. We analyze overall survival and potential prognostic factors in 101 pulmonary resections of CRC metastases in 79 patients, focusing on cases with repeated pulmonary resection or with hepatic metastasectomy. Number of pathological pulmonary metastases was higher than that of preoperatively suspected pulmonary nodules in 18% of the resections. Morbidity rate was 16.5%. There was no mortality. Five-year survival rates from the resection of the CRC and from the first pulmonary metastasectomy were 74.6% and 53.3%, respectively. Prognosis did not decrease in patients with history of hepatic metastasectomy or in those in which repeated pulmonary resection was performed. Age \u226570, preoperative carcinoembrionary antigen (CEA) \u22655 ng/dl and mediastinal lymph node involvement entailed worse prognosis. Pathological lymph node involvement and age were shown as independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. Resection of pulmonary metastases of CRC is a safe procedure, with 5-year survival rates over 50%. History of resected hepatic metastases or needs for more than one pulmonary resection do not seem to decrease survival rates. Only lymph node involvement and age seem to be clearly associated to worse prognosis."}

Expression of COX-2, MMP-2 and VEGF were detected by immunohistochemistry. The positive rate of COX-2, MMP-2, and VEGF expression was 60.4%, 50.3% and 69.1%, respectively. COX-2 correlated with stage, lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and metastasis, and survival rate; MMP-2 correlated with intestinal wall invasion, stage, number of lymph node metastasis, postoperative recurrence and metastasis, and survival rate; VEGF correlated with preoperative serum levels of CEA and CA199, postoperative recurrence and metastasis, and survival rate; the positive rate of COX-2, MMP-2 and VEGF co-expression was 32.9%, which correlated with stage, number of lymph node metastasis, preoperative serum level of CEA, postoperative recurrence and metastasis, and survival rate. The expression of COX-2, MMP-2 and VEGF in colorectal cancer plays a synergistic promoting effect on the malignant biological behavior of tumors, which could be used as a marker to determine the malignant progression, invasion and metastasis, and prognosis of the tumor."}

The optimal oncologic management for patients with T3N0 rectal cancer is currently controversial. Patients with pathologic T3N0 disease may have an \"intermediate\" risk of disease recurrence, suggesting that perhaps trimodality therapy may not be indicated for all patients. Adverse prognostic features, including a greater depth of perirectal fat invasion, poor tumor differentiation, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, abnormally elevated pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen levels (>5 ng/mL), circumferential margin involvement, and a low-lying position may identify T3N0 patients at high risk for local recurrence who may benefit from the addition of radiation therapy. However, recent randomized data suggest an improvement in local control and disease-free survival with preoperative radiation therapy compared with selective postoperative radiation therapy in all patient subgroups, arguing in favor of routine preoperative therapy. Additionally, rates of clinical understaging may exceed 20%, representing the percentage of patients who would require the delivery of postoperative radiotherapy with its associated sequelae. Future prospective randomized studies of T3N0 patients with upfront stratification by known prognostic factors and studies evaluating the molecular profile of rectal cancers hold the promise of better classifying patients at high risk of local and systemic recurrence, and thus, in need of adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy."}

Half of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have metastasis during the whole course of the disease. Fewer than 10% of those are still alive at 5\u00a0years. Locally advanced CRC accounts for 7% to 33% of CRC relapses. Of these, only a small number of patients are resectable with a curative intent. Management of unresectable metastatic or locally advanced CRC is a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CRC and analyze survival rate and prognostic factors influencing the survival. There were 277 patients identified. Several clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated. To determine the prognostic impact of the factors in survival, all parameters were tested from their relationship in Cox-regression model and Cox proportional hazards model. Survival curves were generated according to Kaplan-Meier method and the differences in survival were determined by employing the log-rank test. Three factors that influence the survival were identified: one or more than two organs involved (p\u2009=\u20090.041), higher carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (p\u2009=\u20090.001), and different salvage treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, there were significant differences between patients with one and more than two organs involved (p\u2009=\u20090.027), different ranges of CEA level (p\u2009=\u20090.004), and different salvage treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We clearly demonstrated three factors that influence the survival, including more than two organs involved, higher CEA level, and different salvage treatment. The higher the CEA level and the more organs (\u22652) involved, the worse the survival.

Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related death in developed countries. One of the reasons is the absence of tumor specific diagnostic and prognostic markers. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9) expressions in serum and clinicopathological features of the colorectal adenocarcinoma. Another aim was to examine expression of MMP-9 in the tissue of the colorectal carcinoma in MMP-9 serum positive patients. In addition, we tried to establish the correlation between preoperative levels of serum markers (CEA and CA 19-9) and presence of MMP-2 or MMP-9. The study was performed on 32 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery and 11 patients in a control group who were operated for benign diseases. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the molecular mass and SDS-PAGE zymography to determine levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Expression of MMP-9 was determined immunohistochemically in the tissue of the colorectal carcinoma of MMP-9 serum positive patients. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were increased in the serum of the patients with colorectal cancer compared to the control group. There was significant correlation in MMPs levels among the patients with tumor stage I and II and the patients with tumor stage III and IV. Obtained results did not demonstrate correlation between levels of CEA, CA 19-9 and presence of MMP-2 or MMP-9. MMP-9 expression was positive in 85% of MMP-9 serum positive patients with colorectal carcinoma. The overexpression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 strongly suggests its association with colorectal adenocarcinoma. Detection of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in serum might be useful for identification of patients with higher risk for colorectal cancer recurrence."}

Missing metastases, also called vanishing or disappearing liver metastases, concern about 5% of patients with colorectal liver metastasis undergoing chemotherapy, and this phenomenon is likely to become more frequent in the near future, with the widespread use of highly efficient chemotherapy. As their definition is highly dependent on the quality of initial imaging, a DLM on preoperative computed tomography scan should be systematically confirmed by a second imaging modality, ideally magnetic resonance imaging. It is important to note that a complete clinical response does not mean a complete pathologic response. Currently, there are no absolute criteria of a complete pathologic response. However, treatment with neoadjuvant and adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion in patients <60 years old with an initially low carcinoembryonic antigen level that normalizes under chemotherapy and who have no detectable lesion on both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is probably more likely to yield a complete pathologic response. Whatever their treatment, patients with DLM run a high risk of recurrence that could be decreased with the use of HAI. Despite a high recurrence rate, the overall 5-year survival rate of patients with DLM ranges from 40 to 80%. Having a DLM should no longer be a contraindication to hepatic surgery since long-term survival is expected in these highly chemosensitive patients. The use of adjuvant HAI in addition to efficient systemic chemotherapy could reduce the risk of hepatic relapse."}

The endpoint was length of postoperative disease-free survival, and prognostic importance was determined using the log-rank test and Cox regression hazard model. Six hundred (44.1%) CRC patients had high CEA concentrations preoperatively, and 188 (13.8%) patients retained high values postoperatively.

By univariate analysis TNM staging, tumor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, preoperative CEA concentration, and postoperative CEA concentration affected the outcome. By multivariate analysis, the prognostic importance of postoperative CEA was retained (95% CI, 1.73-3.01; HR = 2.28) but that of preoperative CEA was lost (95% CI, 0.82-1.33; HR = 1.05). CRC recurred earlier in patients with high postoperative CEA concentrations; metastasis to the liver was common (72.3%) among patients in this group. Early postoperative CEA concentration is an independent prognostic factor for CRC. Patients with high postoperative CEA values should receive aggressive follow-up examinations for early relapse of CRC, with special attention paid to recurrence at the liver."}

Thus, aim of the study was the detection of residual peritoneal cancer cells with a possible prognostic role for local recurrence. Twenty-nine patients were operated (R0) for low (extraperitoneal) rectal cancer, without neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Before and immediately after cancer removal, a peritoneal lavage was done to evaluate by RT-PCR the cytokeratin 20 mRNA on isolated cells and in order to detect cancer cells by the Thin-prep test. After a median follow-up of 39\u00a0months, 5 patients died (17%), one for non-cancer-related disease, two (7%) for local recurrence and peritoneal carcinosis, and two for distant metastases.

Subsequently, under the guidance of ultrasonography and radiography, a right portal vein chemoembolization (PVCE) was performed via a percutaneous approach through left portal branch to induce the atrophy of right hemiliver and hypertrophy of left hemiliver. At Week 5 post-PVCE, a second-stage hepatectomy was planned to resect the right hemiliver.

The main outcome measures were cause-specific and disease-free survival with respect to T and N category, International Union Against Cancer stage, venous and lymphatic invasions, grading, CEA level, complete pathologic response, tumor regression grading, International Union Against Cancer stage shift, T, N, and CEA shift, types of neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, interval between completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery, and number of extracted lymph nodes in resected specimens. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Median follow-up was 45 months. One hundred twenty-one patients (69.5%) showed a response to the treatment, whereas 53 (30.5%) did not. Five-year cause-specific and disease-free survival for responders (n = 121) vs nonresponders (n = 53) were 92.6% and 73.7% vs 84.9% and 47.9%. In the univariate analysis, ypN category, venous and lymphatic invasion, tumor regression grading, International Union Against Cancer stage shift, and T and N shift were significantly predictive for cause-specific and disease-free survival. Furthermore, ypUICC stage, ypT category, grading, and complete pathologic response had an impact on disease-free survival. In the multivariate analysis, only the International Union Against Cancer stage shift kept its independent explanatory power for cause-specific P = .012, HR 3.10 (95% CI 1.28-7.51) and disease-free survival P < .001, HR 3.85 (95% CI 1.98-7.51). The determination of International Union Against Cancer stage shift depends on the pretreatment staging modalities. Our investigation demonstrates that the response of tumor to neoadjuvant therapy is an independent prognostic factor in patients with rectal carcinoma."}

Previous studies have suggested a detrimental prognostic effect of preoperative obstruction proximal to colorectal cancer (CRC). If such a detrimental effect is preserved in each stage of advanced (stage II or III) CRC, we can identify high-risk patients. We enrolled 641 patients with pathologically confirmed advanced CRC (stage II, n\u00a0=\u00a0207; stage III, n\u00a0=\u00a0434) who had undergone curative resection of the primary lesion. The association of preoperative obstruction with clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the effect of preoperative obstruction on disease-free survival in each stage. Preoperative obstruction was seen in 63 patients (9.8%) (stage II, n\u00a0=\u00a016; stage III, n\u00a0=\u00a047). Multivariable analysis showed that preoperative obstruction was significantly associated with preoperative elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen level in patients with colon cancer (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a03.59; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while it was correlated with poor differentiation in patients with rectal cancer (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a03.99; P\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Preoperative obstruction was a significant prognostic factor in stage III CRC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but not in stage II disease. Multivariable prognostic analysis showed that preoperative obstruction was a remnant independent prognostic factor in stage III CRC. This finding was confirmed by separate analyses of colon and rectal cancer. Preoperative obstruction was associated with systemic recurrence (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) rather than peritoneal or local recurrence. These findings suggest that preoperative obstruction may predict worse long-term prognosis in patients with stage III CRC and may be a potential clinical marker to identify patients with high-risk stage III CRC."}

The purpose of this study was to detect postoperative persistent circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in stages II and III colon cancer patients undergoing curative resection and so identify a subgroup of patients who are at high risk for early relapse. Four mRNA molecular markers including human telomerase reverse transcriptase, cytokeratin-19, cytokeratin-20, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA were used to detect CTCs in 141 stages II and III colon cancer patients undergoing curative resection to determine the significance of CTCs in postoperative early relapse. Out of 141 patients, postoperative early relapse and non-early relapse/no relapse was found in 48 (34.0%) patients and 93 (66.0%) patients, respectively. Univariately, postoperative early relapse was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.025), vascular invasion (P=0.002), perineural invasion (P=0.001), laparoscopic surgery (P=0.019), high postoperative serum CEA levels (P=0.001), and presence of persistent postoperative CTCs (P<0.001). Using a multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis, the presence of perineural invasion (P=0.034; HR, 1.974; 95% CI: 1.290-3.861), high postoperative serum CEA levels (P=0.020; HR, 2.377; 95% CI: 1.273-4.255), and the presence of persistent postoperative CTCs (P<0.001; HR, 11.035; 95% CI: 4.396-32.190), were demonstrated to be independent predictors for postoperative early relapse. Furthermore, the presence of persistent postoperative CTCs was strongly correlated with a poorer disease-free and overall survival (both P<0.001). This study suggests that molecular detection of persistent postoperative CTCs is a prognostic predictor of early relapse in UICC stage II/III colon cancer patients, and thus could help to define patients with this tumour entity for an enhanced follow-up and therapeutic program."}

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is generally a disease of the older population. The prognosis and clinicopathologic features of CRC in the young, compared with those in older patients, continue to be debated. The aim of this study was to compare the survival, clinicopathologic features, and tumor markers of CRC in patients aged 40 y or younger and older patients. A total of 230 patients with CRC of stage I-III were assessed retrospectively, with an endpoint of recurrence or metastasis after curative operation. The markers CEA, MMP-2, and p27(kip1) were studied by immunohistochemistry in all patients. The young group comprised 28 (12.2%) patients aged 40 y or younger with a median age of 36 y. The remaining 202 patients (87.8%) comprised the old group, with a median age of 61 y. There were no statistical differences in gender distribution, tumor sites, tumor size, or gross type between the young and old groups. The young group had a higher incidence of mucinous adenocarcinoma (17.9%) than the old group (6.4%) (P = 0.035). The distribution of stage, differentiation grade, and extent of venous invasion were similar. The median disease-free survival time was 60 mo for the young group and 49 mo for the old. Univariate analysis revealed that this difference was not significant (P = 0.1158). Multivariate Cox regression analysis also demonstrated that the age of the patient was not an independent factor for the prognosis of CRC. There were no statistical differences between the young and old groups in the expression of CEA, MMP-2, or p27(kip1). The results of this study indicated that there was a subtle difference in the incidence of mucinous adenocarcinoma between young and old patients with CRC. However, stage I-III young patients had a similar disease-free survival period as the older patients. Other clinicopathologic characteristics, and tumor markers such as CEA, MMP-2, and p27(kip1), were also similar between young and old CRC patients."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most frequently used marker for colorectal cancer (CRC). Influence of genetic instability on tumor marker expression is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate microsatellite instability (MSI) of CEA serum levels in locally advanced CRC. The observational cohort consisted of stage II-III CRC patients (n = 131) 75 years old or youngerwho underwent surgery with curative intent. CEA serum levels were measured before (preCEA) and immediately after surgery (postCEA). DNA from the extracted tumors was investigated for MSI. Survival was analyzed in univariate and multivariate analyses. The median preCEA was 3 U/ml (IQR = 1-3, range = 1-136 U/ml). Stage III cancers with MSI had an elevated preCEA more often than those without MSI (25% vs. 0%; p = 0.026). A preCEA >10 U/ml was significantly associated with elevated postCEA (CEA >1 U/ml; odds ratio [OR] = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.1-14.2; p < 0.001). Survival wasnot significantly different between those with postCEA <10 U/ml vs. postCEA \u2265 10 U/ml or when stratified by MSI status. A cutoff of postCEA \u2264 1 U/ml conferred significantly improved survival compared to higher CEA levels. Stratified for MSI status, this difference was significant for microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers only (p = 0.021). In multivariate analysis, postCEA >1 U/ml (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.7-7.3, p = 0.001) and stage III (HR = 6.7, 95% CI = 3.0-14.9; p < 0.001) were predictors of decreased survival. Preoperative CEA levels were significantly higher in stage III cancers with the MSI genotype, and high preoperative CEA was associated with increased postoperative CEA. Absent postoperative CEA in serum conferred improved long-term survival."}

The aim of this study was to measure several parameters in patients with early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and to evaluate them for their utility in routine clinical practice. Pre-operative serum levels of the following parameters were measured in 174 patients with CRC (clinical stage I-III): carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen CA 19-9, proliferative marker thymidine kinase (TK), tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), tissue polypeptide-specific antigen (TPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), C-peptide, insulin, adiponectin and leptin. The control group consisted of 50 patients who were undergoing a complete preventive medical examination and in these patients at the time of blood collection there was no evidence of any cancer disease. Significant increase of the following parameters was found in patients with CRC: CEA, CA 19-9, TPA, IL-6, IL-10, TIMP-1, C-peptide, insulin and adiponectin. Only two of these, CA 19-9 and adiponectin, represent highly unfavorable prognostic factors. If elevated, they affect both progression-free interval and overall survival. Based on our results, we can conclude that none of the measured parameters fulfills the criteria for use for screening nor for primary diagnosis of CRC. Some of the parameters are important for prognosis estimate: Elevated CA 19-9 is related to an unfavorable prognosis, in terms of cancer recurrence and mortality rate. Angiogenetic factor VEGF represents a prognostic factor important for OS. CEA represents a parameter which is related to disease progression. Interleukins seem to be prospective complementary tumor markers. Adiponectin may be used for estimation of advanced stage of cancer and for estimate of risk of cancer recurrence."}

Acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is an uncommon histopathologic variant of SCC, characterized by marked acantholysis, wherein the tumor cells demonstrate defective cohesion to one another in the cancer nest leading to a pseudoglandular or pseudovascular appearance. The most common site of ASCC is the sun-exposed areas of the skin. Sporadic cases of ASCC have also been reported in various mucosal membranes and organs but to our knowledge this is the first case of primary ASCC of the large bowel. A 59-year-old woman underwent right hemicolectomy due to large tumor in cecum and initial part of the ascending colon. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of nests of focally keratinizing large, atypical, squamous epithelial cells. Approximately 70% of the tumor showed acantholytic changes and acantholysis was equally distributed through the entire tumor. Immunohistochemically tumor cells were diffusely positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3 and focally positive for epithelial membrane antigen and syndecan 1. All other tested antibodies (CK7, CK 20, CK MNF116, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, p63, p16, CD31, CD34, CEA, estrogen, progesterone) showed negative reaction. Periodic acid Schiff and alcian blue staining showed no intracellular or extracellular mucinous material in the tumor. The diagnosis of acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma of the cecum was suspected and additional examination was recommended to exclude possibility of metastatic carcinoma. Extensive clinical examination which also included whole-body PET/CT scan showed no additional tumors. After the exclusion of possible metastatic disease the diagnosis of primary acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma of the cecum was confirmed. Six months after surgery the metastasis in small intestine and recurrence in the abdominal cavity at the site of surgery appeared and had the same morphological characteristic as the primary tumor in the cecum. We report a unique case of ASCC arising in cecum and on this way expands the range of tumors originating in colon. Reports of more cases of colonic ASCC would possibly help to elucidate origin, clinical behavior and therapy of these tumors."}

Magnetic electrochemiluminescent Fe(3)O(4)/CdSe-CdS nanoparticle/polyelectrolyte nanostructures have been synthesized and used to fabricate an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA is a protein used as a biomarker for several cancers; particularly, to monitor response to treatment in colon and rectal cancer patients. The nanocomposites can be easily separated and firmly attached to an electrode owing to their excellent magnetic properties. This represents a promising advantage for bioassay applications. More importantly, the nanostructures exhibit intense and stable ECL emissions in neutral solution, which makes them ideal for ECL immunosensing. The 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) polyelectrolyte shell on the nanostructure surface not only enhances the intensity and stability of the ECL signal, but also acts as a crosslinker for immunosensor fabrication. A CEA antibody immobilized onto a nanocomposite/APS/electrode with gold nanoparticles comprises the ECL immunosensor. The principle of ECL detection for CEA is based on a change in steric hindrance after immunoreaction, which leads to a decrease in ECL intensity. A wide detection range (0.064\u2005pg\u2009 ml(-1)-10\u2005ng\u2009 ml(-1)) and low detection limit (0.032\u2005pg \u2009ml(-1)) are achieved. The immunosensor is highly sensitive and selective, and exhibits excellent stability and good reproducibility. It thus has great potential for clinical protein detection. In particular, this approach uses a novel class of bifunctional nanocomposites that display both intense ECL and excellent magnetism, which renders them suitable for a large range of bioassay applications."}

The prevalence of interval censored data is increasing in medical studies due to the growing use of biomarkers to define a disease progression endpoint. Interval censoring results from periodic monitoring of the progression status. For example, disease progression is established in the interval between the clinic visit where progression is recorded and the prior clinic visit where there was no evidence of disease progression. A methodology is proposed for estimation and inference on the regression coefficients in the Cox proportional hazards model with interval censored data. The methodology is based on estimating equations and uses an inverse probability weight to select event time pairs where the ordering is unambiguous. Simulations are performed to examine the finite sample properties of the estimate and a colon cancer data set is used to demonstrate its performance relative to the conventional partial likelihood estimate that ignores the interval censoring."}

A total of 3,849 consecutive colon cancer patients were enrolled in an analysis of short-term outcomes and 2,529 patients were included in an analysis of the long-term outcomes. These patients were divided into the hypoalbuminemic and normal groups according to the definition of hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin < 35 g/L). Advanced age, female gender, abnormal CEA levels, right colon or large tumors, mucinous adenocarcinoma, poor differentiation, stage II cancer, TNM advancing T stage, old cardiovascular accident, diabetes, and liver cirrhosis were more likely to be associated with hypoalbuminemia. Hypoalbuminemic patients had a higher rate of postoperative mortality and morbidity, including complications related to wounds, lungs, the urinary system, and anastomosis. The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with normal albumin and hypoalbuminemia were 78.0% and 60.0%, respectively (P < 0.0001), and the 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 78.9% and 73.5%, respectively (P = 0.0042).

Patients resected for CLM with concomitant EHD experienced a lower 5-year survival than those without EHD (28% vs 55%, P < 0.001). Five poor prognostic factors were identified at multivariate analysis: EHD-location other than lung metastases (5-year survival: 23% vs 33%, P = 0.02), EHD concomitant to CLM recurrence (14% vs 34%, P < 0.001), carcinoembryonic antigen level at least 10 ng/mL (16% vs 37%, P=0.02), at least 6 CLM(9% vs 32%, P = 0.02), and right colon cancer (P = 0.02).

One hundred and twenty patients were included. Blood samples were collected before treatment and 3 weeks later before the next treatment cycle. Plasma TIMP-1 and serum CEA levels were correlated to treatment outcome. No significant associations between baseline TIMP-1 or CEA levels and best response to treatment or progression-free survival (PFS) could be demonstrated. In contrast, high baseline plasma TIMP-1 levels were associated with poor overall survival (OS), P\u2009=\u20090.008, hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20091.80 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.78]. Furthermore, increase in TIMP-1 levels from baseline to immediately before the second cycle of chemotherapy had a significant negative effect on survival (P\u2009=\u20090.03, HR\u2009=\u20091.30, 95% CI: 1.02-1.65) while a decrease in TIMP-1 was significantly associated with a higher objective response rate (P\u2009=\u20090.03). Both high baseline and subsequent increase in TIMP-1 levels were associated with shorter OS in patients with mCRC receiving XELOX as first-line treatment, whereas baseline TIMP-1 levels were not associated with response or PFS following XELOX treatment."}

S100 calcium-binding proteins such as S100B are elevated in primary malignant melanoma and are used as tumor markers for malignant melanoma and numerous other cancers. The purpose of this study was to identify the novel predictors of early relapse in UICC stages II and III colon cancer patients and thus to identify a subgroup of patients who are at high risk for postoperative early relapse. Clinicopathological factors and S100B expression by immunohistochemical staining were retrospectively analyzed in 357 postoperative UICC stages II and III colon cancer patients to determine the predictors of early relapse. Of 357 patients, 114 patients developed postoperative relapse during the follow-up period. Among 114 relapsed colon cancer patients, postoperative early relapse and non-early relapse were found in 56 patients (49.1%) and 58 patients (50.9%), respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that the presence of vascular invasion (P = .025; hazard ratio [HR], 5.532; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.985-14.729), high postoperative CEA levels (P = .019; HR, 6.845; 95% CI, 2.393-15.256), and S100B overexpression (P < .001; HR, 26.250; 95% CI, 7.463-96.804) were demonstrated to be independent predictors of postoperative early relapse. Furthermore, postoperative relapsed colon cancer patients with S100B overexpression were demonstrated to have significantly lower overall survival rates than those without S100B overexpression (P < .001). This study suggests that S100B protein expression is a crucial predictor of early relapse in UICC stages II and III postoperative colon cancer patients and thus could help to define patients with this tumor entity who would benefit from enhanced follow-up and therapeutic program(s)."}

The position paper of the GastrointestinaL Oncology Section of the Israeli Gastroenterological Association recommends specific guidelines for surveillance after polypectomy and curative resection of colorectal cancer. Periodic colonoscopy is necessary for early detection of metachronous lesions or cancer recurrence. After polypectomy of a simple hyperplasic polyp, colonoscopy is repeated in 10 years. Small adenoma dictates colonoscopy after 5-10 years. In the case of advanced adenoma, repeat coLonoscopy is to be conducted after 3 years. The personal impression of the colonoscopists may advance procedures to an earlier colonoscopy, especially after piecemeal polypectomy of a large sessile polyp. Fecal occult blood test or any other screening procedures are not needed after polypectomy. Colonoscopy, carcinoembrionic antigen examination (CEA) and liver imaging are necessary for surveillance after curative resection of colorectal cancer, and improve survival. Total colonoscopy should be performed before the operation or in cases with obstructive carcinoma, colonic imaging should be completed with virtual colonoscopy. Total colonoscopy should be performed 3-6 months after surgery if not conducted previously. The next follow-up is needed 3 and 5 years after the operation. After low anterior resection, the recurrence rate may be high and patients who have not undergone radiation therapy nor mesorectal resection should undergo sigmoidoscopy every 3-6 months for 2-3 years after surgery."}

In the years 2004-2008, 274 rectal cancer patients were evaluated, of which 64 underwent neoadjuvant CRT with subsequent surgery and had also completed other inclusion criteria. The tumour volume before and after the CRT, percentage reduction in the tumour volume and the relation to the change in the CAE value and the histopathological evaluation were evaluated. The distance between the anus and the tumour was from 3 to 15 centimetres, the average value being 8.1 centimetres. In 5 cases the tumour was not histologically found in the resected specimen. Average value of the CEA value before the CRT was 18.12 ng/ml, range 0.7-98.1 ng/ml, after the CRT the average value was 7.00 ng/ml, range 0.5-18.7 ng/ml. The average tumour volume before CRT was 32.48, range 10.3-88.5, after the CRT the average volume was 20.13, range 4.7-55.1. A relation between the change in the T value and the volume reduction before and after the CRT of statistical significance has been proven in this group of patients. This relation however has not been proved in the N value change. Only in one-third of the evaluated patients was there a positive change in both T and N classification.

Of 209 patients presurgically staged for CRC, 207 (male/female = 125/82; mean age = 65.3 \u00b1 11.3 years) underwent curative resection and were included in the present study. The compliance rate with the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) follow-up guidelines was 53%. The cumulative survival at the end of study interval was 96.4%. The test most commonly used in postoperative follow-up of CRC was the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). PET/CT was the test that detected more patients with recurrent lesions (n = 11, positive predictive value = 23.4), including one patient with an asymptomatic curable recurrence (inguinal lymph node metastasis), also being the most effective test (2.1%). However, its high cost makes it the less cost-effective. The use of PET/CT in the postoperative follow-up after curative resection in CRC has proven to be an individualized and effective alternative in the finding of asymptomatic disease curable. Systematic CEA tests with contrast-enhanced CT as a first line of screening and PET/CT as a second line may be an alternative follow up approach after curative resection for CRC."}

Cetuximab therapy has been effectively combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy in the first-, second-, and third-line treatment settings. In general, treatment with cetuximab is well tolerated, though it has been associated with the development of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). In the case of severe HSRs, further therapy with cetuximab is not possible. In contrast with cetuximab, HSRs have been rarely observed with panitumumab therapy. Currently, panitumumab is indicated for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with progressive refractory disease, and there is recent evidence documenting its clinical efficacy with cytotoxic chemotherapy in the first-line and second-line settings. However, the safety and efficacy of panitumumab after progression with cetuximab has not been well documented. We present a retrospective review of our experience in treating 15 patients with mCRC who tolerated panitumumab with clinical benefit after failure on cetuximab therapy from November 2006 through September 2008 at the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, CT and at the Saint Francis Cancer Treatment Center in Grand Island, NE. KRAS status was retrospectively assessed in patients with readily available tumor tissue. All 15 patients were treated with a standard dose of panitumumab 6 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. No patient received premedication therapy. Of the 15 patients treated, 4 received only 2 doses of panitumumab but stopped further therapy because of deterioration in performance status. Of the 11 evaluable patients, we noted minor radiographic responses (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) in 3 patients and stable disease (SD) in 3 other patients after 8 weeks of therapy. Five patients had evidence for progressive disease, and further therapy was stopped. The median duration of SD was 4 months (range, 2-8 months). Among the 11 evaluable patients, 1 patient achieved > 50% reduction in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 112 to 49 U/L), 3 patients had a 25% reduction (59 to 43 U/L, 84 to 61 U/L, and 67 to 42 U/L), and 1 patient had minor reduction in CEA (98 to 83 U/L). All patients tolerated panitumumab well with no occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions. Grade 3/4 toxicities were skin rash in 5 patients and asthenia in 1 patient. The other adverse events observed included grade 1-2 skin rash in 2 patients, grade 2 paronychia in 4 patients, grade 2 hypomagnesemia in 2 patients, and fatigue in 3 patients. One patient had wild-type KRAS, and this individual experienced a minor response to antibody therapy with > 50% reduction in CEA. A second patient was found to have mutant KRAS and, in terms of clinical response, this patient experienced SD for 6 months. The third patient evaluated had mutant KRAS, and this individual was unable to tolerate more than 2 doses and was therefore not evaluable for response. Panitumumab may represent an alternative treatment strategy for patients with refractory mCRC who have experienced failure with standard therapy including cetuximab-based regimens. Our relatively small clinical experience suggests that cetuximab and panitumumab may exert their antitumor activity through different mechanisms; however, further work is required to investigate this potentially interesting issue."}

The value of following serial CEA levels in patients who initially present with less than or normal levels of CEA (nonsecretors) is controversial. This study sought to determine the use of follow-up CEA levels in nonsecretors. A retrospective review was performed of patients with resected Stage I, II, and III CRC. We excluded patients who did not have a pretreatment CEA level, at least two follow-up CEA levels, or in whom CEA levels did not normalize after resection. The patients were grouped by initial CEA values: CEA 5 ng/mL or less (nonsecretors) and CEA 5 + ng/mL: (secretors). We identified 186 patients with CRC; 146 were initial nonsecretors. We identified 22 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer; 6 were secretors and 16 patients were nonsecretors. In the secretors group, CEA was elevated with recurrence in four (66%) of the patients. In the nonsecretors, CEA was elevated with recurrence in eight (50%) of the patients. In summary, many recurrences of CRC are marked by an elevation of CEA regardless of whether the patients initially presented as secretors or nonsecretors."}

Neural invasion was thoroughly characterized in 296 patients with locally advanced uT3-RC (139 with primary resection and 157 with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy [nRCTx]). To identify the precise localization of NI, we investigated the main tumor, peritumoral area, adjacent normal tissue, and all lymph nodes. To classify the clinical impact of NI, an NI severity score was established and related to patient prognosis. Neural invasion was detected in 32% of patients with primary resection and in 19% (P = 0.010) receiving nRCTx. The major location of NI was found in the peritumoral area. The prevalence of NI in the main tumor within the primary resection group was 6%, whereas it was absent in the nRCTx group (P = 0.002). Increasing NI severity, but not NI localization, was associated with a significantly poorer survival and increased local recurrence rate in both groups. Multivariate analysis (including TNM-stage, grading, and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) revealed NI prevalence and severity as independent prognostic factors. Neural invasion in RC has a heterogeneous appearance in regard to its localization and its severity. nRCTx seems to have a suppressive effect on NI.

To evaluate the clinical factors that influence pathological and clinical outcomes after preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer. Between 1999 and 2004, 121 patients with cT3-4 or node-positive rectal cancer received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Preoperative radiation therapy with 45 Gy was delivered. Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy was administered to most of the patients. Pathological complete remission was 14.3% after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. More than 60% tumor circumferential extent was an independent adverse factor for complete remission (P = 0.011, HR 4.643, 95% CI 1.415-15.231). Local recurrence developed in 9.9% of the cases. Serum CEA level > 5 ng/ml (P = 0.057, HR 3.022, 95% CI 0.967-9.441) and > 60% circumferential extent of tumor (P = 0.064, HR 4.232, 95% CI 0.918-19.531) were marginal adverse factors for local recurrence. Five-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 72.2% and 86.6%, respectively. Disease-free survival was poor for patients with the lymph nodes > or = 1 cm in diameter (P = 0.028), cN2 stage disease (P = 0.047) and > 60% circumferential extent of tumor (P = 0.058). Multivariate analysis for disease-free survival showed that the lymph node size > or = 1 cm was an adverse factor (P = 0.019, HR 2.380, 95% CI 1.115-4.906). Patients with > 60% circumferential extent of tumor and cN2 stage had a more unfavorable survival than the other patients (disease-free survival, P = 0.018; overall survival, P = 0.015). Patients with > 60% circumferential extent of tumor and/or lymph node > or = 1 cm also had an unfavorable survival (disease-free survival, P = 0.016; overall survival, P = 0.049). In rectal cancer, circumferential extent of tumor and clinical lymph node status were important factors for preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery. A further prospective study is needed to confirm and expand these findings."}

Many of the liver lesions disappearing on radiologic evaluation after successful chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer are still present and alive. In patients with only some disappearing lesions, exploration should be undertaken to thoroughly evaluate all sites of previous disease. Because many small residual lesions are scars and complete pathologic responses, treatment should include not only complete treatment of all remaining lesions but also parenchymal conservation techniques such as ablations and limited resections. For patients with completely disappearing lesions, the standard therapy is still exploration and direct intraoperative assessment. However, if the patient chooses observation in the setting of negative CEA, MRI, and PET, close follow-up should be undertaken to avoid missing treatable and resectable recurrences."}
{"id": "20816019", "title": "Dendritic cell vaccination of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.", "content": "Dendritic cell vaccination of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is with more than 4000 new cases every year the third most common cancer in Denmark. Metastases are most often found in the liver, and 20-25% of the patients have synchronous metastases to the liver at time of primary diagnosis. Other frequent sites for metastases are lungs and lymph nodes. Without treatment the median survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is 7-9 months. Patients receiving systemic or regional chemotherapy now have a median survival of approximately 20 months. Up to 40% of the patients undergoing intended curative surgery subsequently relapse with local or distant disease, and approximately 80% of the relapses appear within the first 3 years. If the cancer metastasises, and the chances of radical surgery are eliminated, the prognosis is poor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and immunological effects of treating patients with disseminated colorectal cancer with a dendritic cell based cancer vaccine (MelCancerVac). The vaccine consisted of dendritic cells generated from autologous mononuclear cells pulsed with an allogeneic tumor cell lysate, selected for its high expression of cancer associated antigens. A clinical phase I study evaluating tolerability and toxicity of the treatment was established. Six patients with progressive disease were included and the analysis revealed that the treatment was well tolerated and not associated with toxicity. A subsequent clinical phase II study evaluating the activity of the treatment with CT-scan based measurements of tumors (RECIST), self reported quality of life (SF-36), and clinical evaluation was established. Out of twenty included patients with progressive disease, seventeen received intervention with the vaccine. Stable disease was achieved in four patients and two of these remained stable throughout the entire study period. Quality of life remained for most parameters included in the evaluation high and stable. The immunological consequences of the treatment were evaluated with plasma- and serum-levels of inflammatory and non-inflammatory markers (the following 10 cytokines: GM-CSF, INF-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha, and in addition the inflammatory chemokines MIP-1beta, Eotaxin and IP-10) and biomarkers CEA and TIMP-1. These analyses showed that the vaccine induced increasing levels of Th1 cytokines such as GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-2 in patients achieving stable disease. Patients with progressive disease had increasing levels of CEA and TIMP-1, while patients achieving stable disease maintained relatively stable levels. Conclusively, treatment with this dendritic cell based cancer vaccine was non-toxic and safe, clinical response in terms of stable disease was achieved in 24% of the patients, and the patients maintained a high quality of life during treatment. The immunological analyses indicated that the treatment resulted in favourable anticancer responses in the patients' immune system in terms of polarisation towards a Th1 dominated response potentially directed against tumor cells. Since no partial or complete responses were observed and since the number of patients was relatively low these results have to be interpreted with caution. Moreover, phase II study designs do not lead to final conclusions regarding clinical efficacy, which must be validated in larger prospective, randomised and controlled studies."}

We investigated the prognostic significance of the clinical and pathological factors in 97 patients treated with preoperative radiotherapy (50-50.4 Gy over 5-6 weeks) followed by curative resections. A high CEA level (>5 ng/mL) after radiotherapy (hazard ratio, 2.849; 95% confidence interval, 1.061-7.651; p\u2009=\u20090.0377) and pathological lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio, 0.350; 95% confidence interval, 0.154-0.797; p\u2009=\u20090.0124) were independently associated with postoperative recurrence. Although the CEA level before radiotherapy was associated with disease-free survival in a univariate analysis, it lost its statistical significance in a multivariate analysis. The response of the primary rectal lesions, evaluated pathologically by T stage and the degree of regression, was not associated with disease-free survival. In patients without lymph node metastasis, the 5-year disease-free survival of those with a high CEA level after radiotherapy was significantly worse than those with low CEA after radiotherapy (61.6% vs. 89.0%, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.0234). Pathological lymph node metastasis and a high CEA level after radiotherapy were independent predictors of a poor outcome in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative radiotherapy. The CEA level after radiotherapy was capable of discriminating patients with a high risk of recurrence among pathologically node-negative patients."}

Immunohistochemistry represents a relatively new identification technique of cellular and tissular antigens due to an antigen-antibody binding interactions, applied more and more in the pathology laboratories for positive and differential diagnosis of premalignant and malignant lesions and also for evolutive prognosis of tumoral formations. Immunohistochemistry coloration is based on the antigen-antibody affinity, the antibody binding situs being identified either by antibody coloration direct methods or by using an indirect method where the marking is supplied by antibodies called secondary or even tertiary. The present study is based on the immunohistochemical investigation of some molecular markers with a prognosis value in colorectal cancers (CCR), like the antibody p53 immune expression and of some factors supposed to have prognosis value, such as CA19-9 (carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen or Lewis antigen). In the last decade, the studies have tried to define the prognosis of the molecular markers that allow the identification of the patients with recurrent risk after surgical treatment and who can benefit from chemotherapy in an efficient way. The purpose of the study on immunohistochemical markers is to aim towards the treatment based on molecular phenotypes of colorectal tumors. In 2000, according to the Consensus Conference of the Colorectal Working Group of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Prognostic Factors (AJC), there were established four categories of prognosis factors in colorectal cancers based on the practical importance and the number of studies referring to them. The present study is centered on the prognosis factors from the second B category (p53 oncoprotein expression) and the fourth category (CA19-9 immunomarker expression)."}

RUNX3 is a novel gastric cancer tumor suppressor. RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation is associated with many types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the RUNX3 promotor is one of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-specific promotors. CIMP is a distinct phenotype associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal cancer. In this study, the suitability of the quantitative analysis of RUNX3 promoter hypermethylation as a novel serum tumor marker was investigated. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between RUNX3 promoter methylation and MSI in colorectal cancer. A RUNX3 real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RTQ-MSP) technique we developed was used to analyze the CpG sites in the RUNX3 promoter of 119 colorectal tumors and 344 sera from colorectal cancer patients. MSI analysis of 119 colorectal tumors was performed with five microsatellite markers (BAT25, BAT26, D5S346, D2S123, and D17S250). Proximal colon tumors exhibited significantly higher RUNX3 methylation than their paired normal tissues (p=0.0438). Analysis of the clinicopathological parameters revealed that a proximal location (p=0.0054), lymphatic invasion (p<0.0001), and an advanced pathological stage (p=0.0018) were associated with significantly higher RUNX3 methylation. Assessment of the relationship between RUNX3 methylation and tumor MSI revealed 11 out of 13 tumors with high-frequency MSI (85%) were positive for RUNX3 hypermethylation, significantly more than the tumors with low-frequency MSI or which were microsatellite stable (34%, p=0.0070). In preoperative sera from 344 colorectal cancer patients, significantly higher RUNX3 methylation was associated with lymphatic invasion (p=0.0487) and an advanced pathological stage (p=0.0466). Post-operative follow-up data revealed that recurrence cases exhibited significantly higher preoperative serum RUNX3 methylation than non-recurrence cases (p=0.0003). Concomitant analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the preoperative sera showed that 17.7% (61/344) were CEA-negative but RUNX3 methylation-positive, which means assessing both serum RUNX3 methylation and CEA should improve diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma. RTQ-MSP-based quantification of serum RUNX3 methylation is useful for the detection and monitoring of colorectal cancer."}

The prognostic factors for overall survival were evaluated, including early (within 6 months) intrapulmonary recurrence. The factors related to early intrapulmonary recurrence were also analyzed. Thirteen patients (10.4%) had early intrapulmonary recurrence. The median follow-up was 46 months (range, 21 to 99). Early intrapulmonary recurrence (hazard ratio 2.716; 95% confidence interval: 1.027 to 7.182; p = 0.044), extrapulmonary metastasectomy, metastatic hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes, and high prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen levels were independent prognostic factors on multivariate analysis.

The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of postoperative monitoring of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to detect or rule out recurrence in patients with stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) by comparing results with stage III. A total of 303 patients with CRC who underwent curative surgery were enrolled. Serum CEA was assayed, and radiological examination was performed routinely for 5 years after surgery. Yearly recurrence rates, sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratios, and posttest probabilities were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of CEA monitoring in stage II patients are almost same as those in stage III. Whereas recurrences occurred early in stage III, they occurred almost as frequently in both early and late stage II. The obtained posttest probability of recurrence in stage II patients with CEA elevation was significantly lower (only 30% or less) than those in stage III (approximately 80%). Elevation of CEA in patients with stage II CRC does not represent recurrence with high probability. One of the reasons for the unreliability of CEA monitoring was its high false-positive rate. Another tumor marker with a lower false-positive rate is necessary to follow-up stage II CRC patients."}

Multivariate analysis showed that age and lymph node metastasis were closely related with the local post-operative recurrence (P<0.05). Lymph node metastasis and age are very important prognostic factors for the local post-operative recurrence. It is possible to improve the prognosis of rectum cancer by making an early diagnosis and offering a scientific standard therapy."}

In this study, we examined the prognostic value of free cancer cells in peritoneal washings from CRC patients after curative resection using multiple molecular markers, including cancer stem-like cells. A total of 170 CRC patients who had undergone curative surgery were studied. Peritoneal washings of the Douglas cavity were collected and used for cytology and molecular diagnosis. Real-time RT-PCR for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and CD133 mRNA was performed to detect free cancer cells. Molecular detection of CEA, CK20 and/or CD133 (CEA/CK20/CD133) mRNA of the peritoneal washings showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastasis and the tumor stage. The overall survival (OS) rates and peritoneal recurrence-free survival (PFS) rates in CEA/CK20/CD133 mRNA-positive patients were significantly lower than those of marker gene-negative patients.

In this study, we investigated the prognostic potential of SNCG in colon cancer particularly in the patients with normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. SNCG levels were assessed immunohistochemically in cancer tissues from 229 colon adenocarcinoma patients with a mean follow-up of 44 months. Correlations between SNCG levels and clinicopathologic features, preoperative serum CEA level, and clinical outcome were analyzed statistically using SPSS. SNCG levels in colon adenocarcinoma were closely associated with intravascular embolus and tumor recurrence but independent of preoperative serum CEA levels. SNCG expression was an independent prognostic factor of a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that both tissue SNCG and serum CEA were independent prognostic factors of DFS (P = 0.001, <0.0001, respectively) for 170 patients with colon adenocarcinomas. Importantly, SNCG remained a prognostic determinant of DFS and OS (P = 0.001, 0.002) for 97 patients with normal preoperative serum CEA level. Our results suggest for the first time that SNCG is a new independent predicator for poor prognosis in patients with colon adenocarcinoma, including those with normal CEA levels. Combination of CEA with SNCG improves prognostic evaluation for patients with colon adenocarcinoma."}

Pancreatic metastasis from colorectal malignancy is rare and accounts for less than 2% of all pancreatic metastases. A case of colonic metastasis to the pancreas is reported and the literature is reviewed to assess the role and outcome of pancreatic resection for metastatic tumors from colorectal malignancy. A 58-year-old female underwent an emergency left hemicolectomy for an obstructing descending colon growth. The lesion was reported to be adenocarcinoma, Dukes C, with involvement of the serosa and 3 lymph nodes. A postoperative staging CT scan showed no other metastases and she received 6 cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy (folinic acid, 5-flurouracil and oxaliplatin). Nine years after the colectomy during a routine follow-up, there was a sudden rise in her CEA levels. A CT scan revealed a 6.8x4.8 cm mixed consistency lesion in the tail of the pancreas which, on fine needle aspiration cytology, was confirmed to be adenocarcinoma. She underwent a distal pancreatectomy, and histopathology of the resected specimen confirmed a metastatic tumor from colon cancer. She then received 5 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. She was symptom free for nine months and subsequently succumbed to recurrent disease. Pancreatic metastasis from colorectal malignancy is rare. These patients could be asymptomatic in 17% of cases. The time-interval between the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and the detection of pancreatic metastasis varies widely but is approximately 24 months. The median survival time for post-pancreatic resection is 16 months. Pancreatic resection appears to offer good palliation until recurrence of the disease occurs and the possibility of long term cure is rare."}

Various perioperative variables were investigated retrospectively in these patients to confirm a role for repeat metastasectomy and analyze prognostic factors after repeat pulmonary metastasectomy. Overall survival and disease-free survival after repeat pulmonary metastasectomy were, respectively, 61 and 32% at 5 years. On univariate analysis, male gender and less than 1 year of disease-free status after the first pulmonary metastasectomy demonstrated significantly adverse overall survival (p = 0.01 and p = 0.009, respectively). Elevated preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and maximum tumor size larger than 3 cm were also significantly adverse prognostic factors for disease-free survival (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). The overall survival curve after repeat pulmonary metastasectomy was almost identical with that after complete resection of the first pulmonary metastasis. Patients with more than 1 year of disease-free status after the first pulmonary metastasectomy demonstrated a significantly better overall survival. Normal preoperative serum CEA level and maximum tumor size <3 cm were significantly adverse prognostic factors for disease-free survival. Our data imply that repeat pulmonary metastasectomy might be beneficial as it can salvage a subset of patients with colorectal carcinoma who retain favorable prognostic determinants."}

After curative surgery, 129 stage I-III colon cancer patients were followed by chart review, questionnaires, and phone interviews. National surveillance guidelines mandate periodic measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (US/CT), and colonoscopy. However, surveillance was left to the discretion of the treating physicians. Actual surveillance was compared with the recommendations in the guidelines. Datasets of all 129 patients were available.

The parameters evaluated were gender, age, preoperative CEA levels, tumor localisation, duration of surgery, the units of perioperative blood transfusion, tumor differentiation, TNM stages and adjuvant therapies. The presence of preoperative intestinal obstruction, radical abdominopelvic lymph node (RAPL) dissection and lymphatic, vascular and perineural invasion were also evaluated. With 36.6+/-2 months follow-up, 49 (42%) patients developed local recurrence and/or distant metastases. Twenty-three (19.8%) patients presented with isolated local recurrence. Thirteen of 49 patients with local recurrence were successfully operated with R0 curative resection. The OS survival rates for those with curatively and palliatively resected recurrences were 29 and 19 months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the factors related to DFS were tumor localisation and differentiation, neurovascular invasion, blood transfusion and RAPL dissection. Among these factors, only RAPL dissection was not statistically significant for OS. The factors increasing local recurrence rates of CRC should be clearly described. Local and systemic treatment modalities, like preoperative chemoradiotherapy should be planned for patients carrying these risk factors."}

After the operation, adjuvant chemotherapy with uracil/tegafur and oral l-leucovorin was started and continued. However, the CEA level increased after six months, so we switched to CPT-11 at a dose of 100 mg/m2/day for 3 consecutive weeks followed by a week rest. CEA decreased to within the normal range after administration of 4 courses, and CT scan revealed metastatic lesions were reduced after 6 courses. Grade 1 general fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and grade 2 anemia and alopecia were noted, but no serious adverse reaction appeared. After that, CEA slightly increased, so the interval of administration was changed to bi-weekly in consideration of the adverse effect, restarted, and is now continuing. This was then restarted as a bi-weekly treatment, and is being continued now. It is thought this treatment may be simple, easy and promising second-line chemotherapy for uracil/tegafur and oral l-leucovorin-resistant metastatic colorectal cancer."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing is routinely used to monitor the progress of patients with advanced cancer on treatment, or else to detect relapse during follow-up, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although CEA levels have been reported to rise during adjuvant drug therapies, the mechanism of such 'surges' is not clear. This study was conducted to clarify the clinical significance of this phenomenon. We conducted a retrospective analysis of CEA levels in 88 consecutive patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in our center: 39 patients with primary CRC and a comparison cohort of 49 patients with breast cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. In the event of 2 serial CEA increases, endoscopic and/or imaging investigations were performed to exclude recurrence. Subset analyses were based on nodal status and primary tumor type. Primary resection was associated with significant CEA decline in patients with CRC but not in those with breast cancer. Forty-three patients (48.9%) experienced CEA fluctuations exceeding 0.5 ng/mL during adjuvant chemotherapy; CEA increases indicated true recurrence in 2 patients (4.7%). Adjuvant CEA surges occurred both more often and more extensively in disease associated with >or= 4 positive nodes in patients with CRC but not in patients with breast cancer (P < .05). Both the frequency and extent of CEA surges during adjuvant chemotherapy parallel the severity of preoperative nodal involvement in CRC but not in breast cancer, suggesting that such surges reflect tumorilytic effects on occult disease in patients with CRC only. However, whether these CEA surges predict survival that is inferior (ie, because of greater burden of residual disease) or superior (ie, because of greater tumorilytic efficacy) to that of stagematched 'nonsurge' patients, remains to be determined by larger, prospective CRC studies."}

Elevated levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) during follow-up suggest recurrence, which can be visualized by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Since the magnitude of CEA elevation reflects cancer volume, the ability of PET/CT to detect recurrence in patients with only mildly elevated CEA might be limited. However, the accuracy of PET/CT in detecting recurrence associated with elevated CEA has not been fully assessed. We retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT postoperatively relative to CEA levels among patients with CRC. We visually assessed 75 PET/CT evaluations of 57 postoperative patients with CEA >5.0 ng/ml. Tumor volumes were also determined using image analysis software. The final diagnosis was confirmed based on histopathological findings, or at least on 6 months of clinical follow-up. Two lung cancers were excluded and we finally analyzed data from 73 of the 75 PET/CT evaluations. Recurrences were diagnosed in 54 (prevalence 74%). The sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT to detect recurrence was 50/54 (93%) and 14/19 (74%), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 91 and 78%, respectively, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 3.52 and 0.10, respectively. Values for the sensitivity of PET/CT were 88 and 95%, and those for specificity were 78 and 70%, at serum CEA concentrations of 5-10 and >10 ng/ml, respectively.

CEA mRNA (obtained from blood-borne cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and sE-selectin levels were analyzed in blood samples obtained from 78 patients with primary (n = 62) or recurrent (n = 16) CRC, 40 patients with benign colorectal (CR) diseases, and 78 controls. CEA mRNA positivity by RT-PCR was significantly associated with advanced stage (P < .05). Median baseline sE-selectin levels were higher in patients with CRC (43 ng/mL) compared with controls (36 ng/mL) or patients with benign CR diseases (31 ng/mL, P < .001). These were significantly associated with CEA mRNA positivity by RT-PCR (P < .05). Multivariate analysis by forward stepping showed that elevated TNF-alpha (P = .001) and CEA mRNA positivity by RT-PCR (P = .0001) were independent predictors of elevated baseline sE-selectin levels. Positive presurgical sE-selectin levels were associated with an increased recurrence rate compared with patients with low levels of this molecule (P < .001). Positivity for both CEA mRNA and sE-selectin had a negative prognostic impact, with a 5-year recurrence-free survival rate of 51% compared with 95% of patients with negative parameters (P < .05). Detection of presurgical serum sE-selectin levels and CEA mRNA-positive blood-borne cells in CRC patients might provide useful prognostic information in terms of recurrence-free survival, either alone or in combination, and may help in the choice of more aggressive treatment and/or more strict follow-up procedures in high-risk patients."}

Since chemotherapy with bevacizumab has become available for advanced colorectal cancer, its effectiveness has been reported. Generally, the RECIST guideline has been adopted to determine antitumor effects, however, several problems exist with the image analysis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of CEA to predict the effect of chemotherapy with bevacizumab. Twenty-five patients with advanced colorectal cancer were given chemotherapy with bevacizumab since August 2007. Among them, 18 patients were evaluated for the antitumor effect according to the RECIST guideline and were enrolled in this study. The relation of CEA and antitumor effects, and the change of CEA in every patient were analyzed retrospectively. Patients consisted of 16 men and 2 women, with a mean age of 64. 2 (49-78) years. Chemotherapy with bevacizumab was given for 7 cases with metachronous recurrences after curative operations (6 cases with liver and/or lung metastasis and 1 case with pelvic recurrence), and for 11 cases with synchronous liver and/or lung metastasis. First-line chemotherapy was given to 16 cases and second-line to 2 cases. The overall response rate was 55. 6%, and the response rate in 16 cases given bevacizumab as first-line was 56. 3%. The response rate in 3 cases whose CEA was within the normal range before chemotherapy was 100%. However, the response rate in 15 cases whose CEA was over the normal range was 46. 7%. Furthermore, 6 cases among 7 whose CEA was over 100 ng/mL had 5 months or less during which CEA could be kept under control with a mean period of 3. 0 months. On the contrary, 6 cases among 8 whose CEA was under 100 ng/mL had 5 months or more of CEA-controlled periods with a mean period of 8. 4 months. In chemotherapy with bevacizumab, the response rate in patients with normal CEA was higher than that in patients with high CEA. Patients with a CEA level of 100 ng/mL or more had a short CEA-controlled period, suggesting the effect of chemotherapy was small in those patients. There is a possibility that CEA might be clinically useful as a biomarker to predict treatment efficacy in chemotherapy with bevacizumab."}

The clinicopathological features and prognosis of 2417 patients with sporadic primary colorectal cancer who underwent an operation at the Asan Medical Center between January 1998 and December 2002 were examined. The patients' clinicopathological parameters and follow-up and survival data were obtained from a prospectively collected database. Of the 2417 patients, a lymphovascular invasion-positive tumor was detected in 610 (25.2%). Compared with patients with lymphovascular invasion-negative tumors those with lymphovascular invasion-positive tumors were older (P < .001) and had higher preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (P = .011). Their tumors were also more likely to be poorly differentiated (P < .001) and more advanced in terms of T and N categories (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). The lymphovascular invasion-positive tumors were also more likely to have metastasized systemically (P < .001). Although lymphovascular invasion-positive and lymphovascular invasion-negative tumors metastasized equally frequently to the liver, lung, peritoneum, and bone, lymphovascular invasion-positive tumors metastasized to systemic lymph nodes more often (P < .001). These tumors also recurred at systemic lymph nodes after curative intent surgery more often (P = .007). Lymphovascular invasion-positive status was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for the 5-year overall and 5-year disease-free survival of patients with sporadic colorectal cancer (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). Lymphovascular invasion-positive status could be used to identify patients with sporadic primary colorectal cancer with aggressive tumors and as a factor that independently indicates an unfavorable prognosis."}

In June 2009, an abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a tumor 2 cm in size at the lower anterior mesorectum and a second mass 2 cm in size at the anterior abdominal wall midline. Total colonoscopy showed no mucosal lesion. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal. A biopsy of the mesorectum tumor showed similar histologic characteristics with the primary tumor. Since no other site of recurrence was identified, an abdominoperineal resection was attempted. During the operation and after the removal of the incision recurrence, sinus bradycardia and signs of myocardial ischemia were noticed. A loop transverse colostomy was immediately perfomed and the operation was terminated. Postoperative cardiologic examination revealed an acute myocardium infract. Chemo-radiation of the mesorectum tumor and re-evaluation for surgical excision was decided. Metachronous metastasis of the mesorectum from sigmoid colon cancer is extremely rare.

Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, performance of postoperative values of CEA or CA19-9 for detecting recurrence was assessed. The sensitivity (1.000) and specificity (0.978) of the postoperative values of CEA in the high preoperative CEA group were very high. Even in the normal preoperative CEA group, the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve of CEA (0.740, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.628-0.852) was significantly larger than 0.5 (P < 0.001). The postoperative values of CA19-9 showed high sensitivity (0.833) and specificity (0.900) in the high preoperative CA19-9 group, while the AUC of the ROC curve of the normal preoperative group was as small as 0.510 (95% CI, 0.376-0.644).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of FDG PET/CT in postoperative colorectal cancer patients with normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. This retrospective study was conducted on 63 FDG PET/CT cases, involving postoperative colorectal cancer patients suspected of having recurrent or metastatic lesions with normal CEA levels. The diagnostic performance of FDG PET/CT was evaluated based on diverse suspected conditions, using physical examination, a conventional imaging work-up, and endoscopy. Histopathology, a clinical imaging work-up (including an FDG PET/CT examination), and determination of tumor marker levels during the follow-up served as the reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for FDG PET/CT were 95, 76.6, and 88.8% for a lesion-by-lesion analysis, and 96.3, 86.1, and 90.5% for a case-by-case analysis, respectively. Three false-negative lesions among 107 suspected recurrent findings were identified as compared with nine false-positive lesions. For radiologically suspected recurrent or metastatic conditions, FDG PET/CT diagnostic performance was superior to radiological image modalities, for both lesion-by-lesion and case-by-case analyses. On follow-up of patients with normal CEA levels, but high CA19-9 levels, the use of FDG PET/CT detected true-positive findings in 63.3% of cases.

Here, we report a case of a 47-year-old man with metastatic, chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer who achieved long-term partial remission during panitumumab therapy. A 41-year-old male patient presented with a 24-hour history of abdominal pain and fever. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a voluminous and perforated abscess with a suspected tumour lesion in the sigmoid colon. The patient underwent sigmoidectomy and was diagnosed with a poorly differentiated necrotic carcinoma of the sigmoid colon with invasion in 13 of 19 tested lymph nodes. A colonoscopy revealed multiple tubular adenomas and a positron emission tomography CT scan showed multiple and bilateral hyperfixating lumbar-aortic lymph nodes leading to a final tumour classification of T4N2M1. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated. The patient achieved a partial response following six cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin), then progressed and was enrolled in a trial where he received treatment with FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil) with or without a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor (PTK787/ZK 222584 [valatinib]). Eight months later he progressed again and was included in a panitumumab (6mg/kg every 2 weeks) monotherapy trial. A partial response was noted after 8 weeks of therapy along with a rapid CEA reduction and decrease in lymph node size. The patient is continuing panitumumab treatment and is still in partial remission after 65 months' treatment. He has non-mutated KRAS and no human-anti-human antibodies have been detected. During treatment the patient has on occasion experienced grade 1-2 diarrhoea as well as folliculitis and acne-like rash up to grade 3 in severity. Cutaneous toxicity was managed with a combination dose interruption/reduction and the use of topical agents. No eye or nail toxicities occurred. This case shows that long-term responses are possible during panitumumab therapy and that this agent may be an effective long-term treatment option for selected patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

The role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the early detection of recurrence during the postoperative follow-up of colorectal cancer remains unclear. We hypothesize that the tumor with longer lead time of CEA elevation to the definite recurrence may have a better prognosis because of its slower growth rate and closer observation. From 1995 to 2003, 4,841 consecutive patients who received curative resection of localized colorectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled from a prospective database. The patients with persisting CEA elevation after operation had been already excluded. Postoperative follow-up, including physical examination, imaging, and CEA test, were performed according to a surveillance program. A CEA >/=5 ng/mL was defined as elevated. The definition of the CEA lead time was the period between CEA elevation and detection of recurrence. All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS package for Windows (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). The postoperative median follow-up time for the 4,841 patients was 68 months. A total of 999 patients (20.6%) had CEA elevation and recurrence. Among these patients, recurrence was confirmed in 727 patients (72.8%)before, at the same time, or within 3 months of CEA elevation and thus had a short lead time of CEA elevation (SLT group). In 272 patients (27.2%), recurrence was confirmed after more than 3 months of CEA elevation and thus had a longer lead time of CEA elevation (LLT group). The recurrence pattern showed similarities in these two groups. A total of 193 patients (193/999, 19.3%) received a second radical operation, and 806 patients (80.7%) were inoperable. The re-resection rate between the SLT group (146 patients, 20.1%) and the LLT group (47 patients, 17.3%) was not significantly different. The overall survival rate after recurrence showed no difference between these two groups (P = 0.123). Most cases of recurrence were detected at nearly the same time when the CEA level was elevated. Therefore, a more sensitive test is needed for early detection. The relationship between the lead time of CEA and the clinical outcome was not statistically significant. A more aggressive approach to the patient who has CEA elevation and is highly suspect of recurrence may be needed."}

We investigated the cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CSE1L/CAS) protein in comparison with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a marker for metastatic colorectal cancer. Using serum from 103 patients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease, CSE1L was detected in 36.0% (9 of 25), 57.7% (15 of 26), 71.4% (30 of 42), and 88.9% (8 of 9) of patients, respectively; a pathological CEA level was found in 16.0% (4 of 25), 42.3% (11 of 26), 47.6% (20 of 42), and 77.8% (7 of 9) of patients, respectively; a combined CSE1L/CEA assay was detected in 48.0% (12 of 25), 65.4% (17 of 26), 88.1% (37 of 42), and 100% (9 of 9) of patients, respectively. Lymphatic metastasis is an important predictor of poor prognosis and crucial for determination of therapeutic strategy.

Clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed to identify those associated with a true CR. During chemotherapy, 39 patients (9%) had a total of 118 DLMs on follow-up CT scans. Sixty-eight DLMs were resected, and 50 were followed clinically. Overall, 75 DLMs (64%) were true CRs, including 44 pathologic CRs and 31 durable clinical CRs. On multivariate analysis, the use of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 6.2; P = .02), the inability to observe the DLM on a magnetic resonance image (OR, 4.7; P = .005), and normalization of serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (OR, 4.6; P = .006) were associated independently with a true CR. Approximately 66% of DLMs represented a true CR according to assessment by resection or radiologic follow-up. Predictive factors may help to stratify patients who are likely to harbor residual disease."}

We evaluated the prognostic value of the preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in patients with colon cancer. We reviewed 474 patients who underwent potentially curative resection for nonmetastatic colon cancer. Patients were categorized into two groups according to the preoperative serum CEA level: low CEA (<5 ng/ml) and high CEA (>or=5 ng/ml) groups. During the median 45-month follow-up period, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates for patients with a low CEA level were 81.7% and 82.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the rates for those with a high CEA level (69.9%; P = 0.011 and 70.6%; P = 0.002, respectively). A multivariate analysis revealed that a preoperative serum CEA level was a significant independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (P = 0.021) and disease-free survival (P = 0.026). Both the overall and disease-free survival rates in patients with stage II tumors differed significantly between the low and high CEA groups, whereas the rates did not different between those with stage I and III tumors. Preoperative serum CEA is a reliable predictor of recurrence and survival after curative surgery in patients with colon cancer, particularly in those classified as having stage II disease."}

Detection of proteins that signal the presence or recurrence of cancer is a powerful therapeutic tool for effective early diagnosis and treatment. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been extensively studied as a tumor marker in clinical diagnosis. We report on the development of an amperometric biosensor for the detection of CEA based on the immobilization of anti-CEA monoclonal antibody on a novel class of bipodal thiolated self-assembled monolayers containing reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester end groups. The current variations showed a linear relationship with the concentration of CEA over the range of 0-200 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 3.8 nA x mL x ng(-1) and a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL, which is well below the commonly accepted concentration threshold (5 ng/mL) used in clinical diagnosis. Real time and accelerated stability studies of the reporter antibody under various storage conditions demonstrated that the enzymatic activity and antibody affinity of the conjugate is retained for long periods of time in commercial stabilizing buffers such as StabilGuard Biomolecule Stabilizer, and a prediction of the stability trends was carried out using the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters obtained from the Arrhenius equation. The developed immunosensor as well as a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit were successfully applied to the detection of CEA in serum samples obtained from colon cancer patients, and an excellent correlation of the levels of CEA measured was obtained. Ongoing work is looking at the incorporation of the developed biosensor into a platform for multiplexed simultaneous detection of several breast cancer related biomarkers."}

A 64-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room in May 2000 due to pelvic pain, functional disability of the lower limb, and bleeding from a rectal fistula. The patient was diagnosed with a rectum-sigma adenocarcinoma (pT1N0M0 stage). After surgery by left hemicolectomy, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur for 6 months. Due to the development of subsequent recurrences (infravesical relapse, bone and lung progression) associated with CEA progression and pain worsening, the patient received treatment by every available agent for the metastatic colorectal cancer, including oxaliplatin and radiotherapy; irinotecan; FOLFOX schema; oral capecitabine; raltitrexed; irinotecan and cetuximab; cetuximab as a single agent; always in combination with zolendronic acid-based treatment for pain control. Once the patient had progressed to all the approved drugs available in the market, sunitinib (50mg/day given for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest) was proposed as compassionate use. The patient received sunitinib for a total of 6 months (four cycles). On account of the nonmeasurable disease nature of the metastatic presentation in the present case, the clinical benefit was measured in terms of reduction of painkiller intake, improvement in performance status of the patient, and CEA serum levels. In addition to all of these clinical and biological data, CT images showed an increase in necrotic area of the bone lesion without any decrease in tumor size by classical RECIST criteria. The patient is still under sunitinib treatment and has recovered his normal daily activity."}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of each examination included in the postoperative surveillance program, especially that of serum tumor markers. Patients who underwent curative surgery for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) from January 2000 to December 2006 were enrolled. The postoperative surveillance program in our department includes tumor marker (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and carbohydrate antigen [CA] 19-9) measurement every 3 months for 5 years, chest radiograph or chest computed tomography (CT) every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until 5 years, and abdominal CT every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until 5 years. The first examination that revealed abnormality in patients who developed recurrence was analyzed. During the study period, 105 recurrences were diagnosed. There were 45 hepatic recurrences, 23 local recurrences, 20 pulmonary recurrences, 16 lymph node recurrences, and 10 peritoneal recurrences. Computed tomography, CEA, and CA 19-9 were the first abnormal examination(s) in 77, 23, and 26 patients, respectively. Tumor markers detected the recurrence earlier than did CT in 27% of patients. CEA and CA 19-9 equally contributed to detection with respect to the number of patients, while the sites of detected recurrences differed. For early detection of occult recurrence of CRC, CT was the most reliable modality. On the other hand, tumor markers were also relevant. Given the recent advances in multimodal approaches for advanced CRC, the combination of CT, CEA, and CA 19-9, which is currently not included in guidelines, should be routinely performed."}

This study was undertaken to determine the ability of protein expression in primary colorectal cancer and metastatic liver tumour tissues to predict hepatic metastasis and intrahepatic recurrence. Sixty patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study. The expression of the following five proteins was assessed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1; MMP-7; and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1. Protein expression was measured in patients with primary colorectal cancer without liver metastasis (Group A), in patients with primary colorectal cancer with liver metastasis (primary tumour; Group B), and in patients with resected metastatic liver tumour tissues (liver metastasis; Group C). IHC staining revealed more protease activity (MMP-1 and -7) in Group B than in Group A. Angiogenic activity (positive VEGF expression) was significantly greater in Group C than in Group B. Multivariate analysis showed that positive MMP-1 expression, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and an elevated pre-operative serum CEA level (> 5 ng/ml) were significantly related to synchronous liver metastasis. However, intrahepatic recurrence was not related to protein expression, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, or the pre-operative CEA level. Our findings suggest that protease activity is important for metastasis, and that angiogenic activity is essential for metastatic tumour growth. Furthermore, positive MMP-1 expression in primary colorectal tumour tissues was a significant predictor of liver metastasis. However, the prognostic impact of protein marker expression in terms of intrahepatic recurrence appears to be minimal."}

The introduction of stage-independent prognostic markers may play a significant role in future selection for adjuvant treatment for early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of this study was to assess the combination of preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and plasma tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 as a prognostic index in patients with primary, curatively resected CRC. Blood samples were collected before surgery from 422 patients with CRC stage I-III (Dukes' stage A-C). CEA was determined in serum by a routine analysis and TIMP-1 was determined in plasma using a validated in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Disease-free survival (DFS) was registered and its associations with serum CEA and plasma TIMP-1 levels were studied using a Cox multivariate model. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for DFS were calculated. An event was recorded in 186 patients: 75 had local recurrence, 75 had distant metastases, 28 had both local recurrence and distant metastases, and 36 died from their cancer without a registered recurrence. Scoring CEA and TIMP-1 as continuous variables on a logarithmic scale, serum CEA and plasma TIMP-1 were statistically significant in a multivariate analysis with HR = 1.1 (95% CI 1.0-1.2) and HR = 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.0), respectively. The two serological markers could be combined to form a prognostic index adjusted for baseline variables. This index showed a 51% increase in HR for a given CEA level if the TIMP-1 level was doubled. Preoperative serum CEA and plasma TIMP-1 levels are independent predictors of DFS in patients with primary resectable CRC. In combination these two proteins could form an index for the assessment of risk of disease recurrence in early-stage CRC."}

The identification of rectal cancer patients predisposed to developing recurrent disease could allow directed adjuvant therapy to improve outcomes while decreasing unnecessary morbidity. This study evaluates carcinoembryonic antigen cellular adhesion molecule-7 (CEACAM-7) expression in rectal cancer as a predictive recurrence factor. A single-institution colorectal cancer database and a frozen tissue biobank were queried for rectal cancer patients. CEACAM-7 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression from normal rectal mucosa and rectal cancers was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression-level differences among normal tissue, disease-free survivors, and those that developed recurrence were analyzed. Eighty-four patients were included in the study, which consisted of 37 patients with nonrecurrent disease (median follow-up, 170 months), 29 patients with recurrent disease, and 18 patients with stage IV disease. CEACAM-7 expression was decreased 21-fold in rectal cancers compared with normal mucosa (P = .002). The expression levels of CEACAM-7 were relatively decreased in tumors that developed recurrence compared with nonrecurrence, significantly for stage II patients (14-fold relative decrease, P = .002). For stages I-III, disease-free survival segregates were based on relative CEACAM-7 expression values (P = .036), specifically for stage II (P = .018). CEACAM-7 expression is significantly decreased in rectal cancer. Expression differences between long-term survivors and those with recurrent disease introduce a potential tumor marker to define a subset of patients who benefit most from adjuvant therapy."}

Guidelines on suitable methods for scheduled follow up examinations are needed. This study evaluates a strict follow-up program including carcinogenic embryonic antigen (CEA), chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). A cohort of 132 patients, treated by surgery with curative intent for CRC, was included. Patients were followed prospectively with scheduled controls at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after curative surgery. CEA, chest X-ray, US, CT and FDG-PET supplemented by clinical examination. The end-point was recurrence. Sensitivity and specificity was estimated 2 years after surgery. Of the 132 patients included in the study, 25 experienced recurrence, detected at scheduled controls (n = 18) and at intervals between them (n = 7). The results of CT and FDG-PET were correlated with recurrence. CT combined with FDG-PET had the highest specificity and sensitivity. A total of 72% of recurrences were detected at scheduled controls. The findings supported a strict follow-up program following curative surgery for colorectal cancer. FDG-PET combined with CT should be included in control programs."}

Chemonaive patients with asymptomatic mCRC who did not require immediate chemotherapy-induced tumor reduction received a 400-mg thrice daily loading dose of enzastaurin on day 1 of cycle 1, followed by 500 mg once daily for the remaining 28-day cycles. Progression was assessed on the basis of radiographic imaging, rise in carcinoembryonic antigen or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels or by appearance of clinical symptoms. Twenty-eight patients received daily enzastaurin. The 6-month PFS rate was 28% [95% confidence interval (CI) 13%-45%] and median PFS was 1.9 months (95% CI 1.8-4.5 months). Twelve (43%) patients had stable disease with a median duration of 6.1 months. The survival rate at 20 months was 77% (95% CI 47%-92%). No grade 4 toxicity was reported and grade 3 toxic effects were observed in three patients with one patient showing probable drug-related elevation of liver transaminases. The window design in asymptomatic patients with mCRC can be safely applied to assess the activity and safety of novel cytostatic agents like enzastaurin."}

Surgical resection has been the first choice of treatment for resectable pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer. However, early intrapulmonary recurrence is often observed and appropriate assessment of prognostic factors is controversial. The aim of this study was to define the factors affecting survival and intrapulmonary recurrence after surgical treatment of metastatic pulmonary tumours from colorectal cancer. A retrospective analysis was performed of 56 consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary resection for colorectal metastases with a focus on prognostic factors and risk factors for intrapulmonary recurrence. The overall 5-year survival rate was 48.2%. In a univariate analysis, a short disease-free interval (DFI), multiple pulmonary metastases and abnormal prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were poor prognostic factors. In a multivariate analysis, a short DFI and abnormal prethoracotomy CEA levels were independent prognostic factors. Twenty-two (39.3%) of the 56 patients had recurrences in the remnant lung after resection for pulmonary metastases, and 8 (36.4%) of these 22 patients underwent repeated pulmonary resections. The median DFI between first and second lung metastasis was 13 months. Univariate analyses revealed that multiple and bilateral lung metastases were risk factors for intrapulmonary recurrence. There was also a strong correlation between the DFI for intrapulmonary recurrence after the first pulmonary resection and the DFI for first pulmonary metastases. A short DFI was a risk factor for early tumour recurrence after resection for pulmonary metastases. The DFI might reflect oncological characteristics such as the tumour doubling time in colorectal cancer."}

Pelvic recurrent rectal cancer is still a challenging clinical problem, and patients generally have a dismal prognosis and a poor quality of life. Surgical resection represents the only potentially curative treatment; neoadjuvant treatments are presently being taken into consideration to increase the resectability rate and to improve long-term survival. Among 157 patients observed with recurrent rectal cancer, a series of 58 patients who underwent surgical exploration with curative intent for isolated local recurrence at a single referral institution was retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, pathologic, and therapeutic factors were evaluated to assess long-term prognosis and local control. Forty-four (75.9%) of 58 patients underwent surgical resection. The overall 5-year survival rate for patients who underwent surgical resection was 54.2%, whereas none of the unresected patients lived 5 years (P < 0.001). Patients with R0 resection showed a statistically higher 5-year overall survival and local control rate (72.4 and 70.2%, respectively) compared to R1 patients (37.5 and 31.2%, respectively). At multivariate survival analysis, feasibility of a surgical resection and radicality of excision proved to be independent positive prognostic factors. In contrast, increased presalvage carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels, back pain at diagnosis, and an increasing degree of fixation of recurrent disease to the pelvic wall at preoperative computed tomographic scan were statistically significantly linked to decreased overall survival. Preoperative chemoradiation and radicality of the surgical excision independently influenced the local control among surgically resected patients. Surgical resection still remains the most important therapeutic and prognostic factor for patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer. Multimodal treatments can be safely performed by an experienced team in referral tertiary centers and can result in a safer outcome, better local disease control, and even long-term survival in carefully selected patients."}

Using RT-PCR we studied HERG, CEA, CK19 and CK20 expression in colorectal carcinomas and non-carcinoma controls. HERG1 immunhistochemistry was performed in a total of 66 specimens, in colorectal carcinoma (n = 23), in matched histopathologically negative samples (n = 23) taken near the excision site from the same tumor patients and in healthy control biopsies (n = 20). In order to verify the relevance of HERG1 for tumor proliferation we studied the effect of HERG1 inhibition in the Colo-205 colon cancer carcinoma cell line using the MTT-assay. HERG1 was expressed in all tumor samples regardless of their stage and in adenomas larger than 0.4 cm, but absent in small adenomas, sigmadiverticulitis specimen and healthy histopathologically negative samples, except for one which developed a tumor recurrence. In contrast, CEA, CK19 and CK20 were absent in some tumors. The selective HERG1 inhibitor E-4031 dose-dependently impaired tumor growth in the proliferation assays. Our data indicate that HERG1, but not CEA, CK19 or CK20, is a highly sensitive and reliable tumor biomarker that may constitute a novel molecular target for tumor treatment."}

Examination of tumour markers conducive to follow up of the patients with colorectal carcinoma.

The resection therapy resulted in the decrease in post-operative CEA levels. There were no changes in pre- and post-operative CA 19-9 levels; unlike with post-operative TPS levels having been significantly increased, probably due to reparation processes resulting from the surgery. It can be concluded that pre- and post-operative CEA levels are the most suitable markers to check the effect of surgery. With a 95%-specificity for the establishment of recidives, the highest sensitivity was reached with TPS (83%); the sensitivities of the classical tumour markers CEA and CA 19-9 were significantly lower (41% and 25%, respectively). The results should be interpreted with caution due to a small number of relapses regarding a short follow up and rather local-regional character of the recidives. However, TPS seems to be a promising marker for the follow up of the patients with colorectal carcinoma. Thus, an ideal combination seems to be that of CEA and TPS."}

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the combination of targeted therapy and chemotherapy on serum homocysteine and other laboratory parameters of cardiovascular risk in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Thirty-one patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with the combination of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin were studied before and during the therapy. Serum homocysteine decreased significantly throughout the course of treatment. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol also decreased significantly during the first month of therapy. In contrast, serum retinol significantly increased during the second and third months of treatment. A significant increase in glycosylated hemoglobin was also observed. After an initial rise, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were significantly lower compared to baseline throughout the course of treatment. Serum ferritin increased throughout most of the course of treatment. A significant correlation was observed between CRP and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, retinol, ferritin, and CEA. CEA correlated with hemoglobin, retinol, and ferritin. Retinol correlated significantly with hemoglobin. Tumor control, reflected in lower CEA, resulted in suppression of the acute phase response and generally in favorable effects on laboratory parameters indicative of risk factors of atherosclerosis, including lower homocysteine concentrations, and lower total and LDL cholesterol."}

Neo-adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRTx) has become a standard therapeutic regimen for rectal carcinoma. This therapeutic option allows more sphincter preserving surgical procedures and seems to improve prognosis in patients with rectal carcinoma. The aim of this study is to analyse factors influencing prognosis in terms of disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after CRTx. We have reviewed the clinical and morphological data of 39 patients after neo-adjuvant chemoradiation therapy, including immunohistochemistry for p53, cyclin D1, MIB-1 (Ki67) and bcl-2 protein in paraffin-embedded tissue. In our series, 12 patients did not respond to neo-adjuvant therapy, 12 showed a complete response and 15 a partial response. When we analysed the factors influencing DFS we found a significant influence of neural, vascular and lymphatic invasion, pre-operative and postoperative CEA, TNM staging, smoking and histological response to CRXT in the univariate analysis. As for OS, we found a significant influence of TNM staging, histological grade, peritumoral inflammatory reaction and vascular and neural invasion. No multivariate analysis was performed due to the small sample size. In our series of patients with rectal carcinoma receiving pre-operative chemoradiation therapy, histopathological response has influenced prognosis."}

The optimal combination and frequency of surveillance tests is unknown. Imaging of the chest and abdomen have increasingly been recommended by professional organizations, in addition to CEA levels, in order to detect resectable recurrences. Metachronous cancers are relatively uncommon, nonetheless, surveillance colonoscopy is typically recommended.

Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) is an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase involved in protein synthesis and regulation of RNA transcription and translation and is an inhibitor of angiogenesis. TrpRS has been shown to be differentially expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and has thus been identified as a potential prognostic marker. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of TrpRS to the prognosis of patients diagnosed and treated for CRC within a defined population. With a polyclonal, monospecific IgG antibody, TrpRS expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays with tumors from a population-based CRC cohort (n = 320). Staining intensity and fraction of positive tumor cells were recorded. A Cox multivariate model including TrpRS expression, carcinoembryonic antigen, age, stage, tumor differentiation, and lymphatic and vascular vessel invasion was used to calculate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for time to recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Low expression of TrpRS correlated to increased risk for lymph node metastasis (P = 0.025) and a more advanced tumor stage (P = 0.001). Patients with tumors and increased levels of TrpRS expression had better survival than patients with low expression levels. Multivariate analyses revealed significantly better disease-free survival (relative risk, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.95) for patients with high expression than for patients with low expression of TrpRS. For colon cancer patients, a reduced risk for recurrence was seen in patients with increased TrpRS expression (relative risk, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.80). Low expression of TrpRS in tumor tissue correlates with increased risk for recurrence and worse survival in patients with CRC. This can be related to its antiangiogenic properties and could aid in the future selection of new drugs in the treatment of CRC."}

Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been shown to be more effective against solid tumor micrometastases, possibly due to an inverse relationship between tumor size and radiolabeled antibody uptake. In this study, the accretion of radiolabeled antibody in intrahepatic micrometastases in an experimental model was investigated using quantitative digital autoradiography, enabling the analysis of antibody uptake in microscopic tumors. Mice bearing subcutaneous or intrahepatic metastatic models of LS174T colorectal cancer were injected with radiolabeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody ([(125)I]A5B7). Tissues were taken to investigate distribution of radionuclide and tumor uptake. In a therapy study, mice bearing intrahepatic metastatic tumors were injected with [(131)I]A5B7. Subcutaneous tumors and large metastatic deposits had similar uptake (e.g., approximately 15%ID/g at 24 h). Small metastatic deposits had higher uptake (e.g., approximately 80%ID/g at 24 h) and prolonged retention at later time points. Small deposit uptake was significantly reduced by accompanying large deposits in the same liver. RIT resulted in increased survival time (untreated mean survival of 21.6+/-12.9 vs. treated mean survival of 39.1+/-30.8 days), but there was a large range of response within groups, presumably due to variation in pattern and extent of tumor as observed in the biodistribution study. Liver function tests and body weight did not change with tumor growth or therapy response, strongly supporting the use of in vivo imaging in metastatic tumor therapy studies. Radioimmunodetection and therapy might be greatly influenced by the size and distribution of intrahepatic tumor deposits."}

It should be based on case history, clinical examination and examination of tumor markers (particularly CEA). Other examinations are indicated only for patients with abnormal findings or during normal annual check-ups. The salvage surgery for CRC recurrence covers a large scale of surgical performances from limited local resections up to extensive surgery including pelvic exenteration and peritonectomy.

Although aggressive resection of pulmonary metastases prolongs the survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, there is a need for predictive pathologic parameters to understand the key molecular events of metastatic progression. The aim of this study was to verify immunohistochemical markers in addition to established clinical parameters after surgery. From our subset of patients undergoing resection of pulmonary metastases from metastatic colorectal carcinoma, we analyzed 39 patients (23 men and 16 women) between 2003 and 2007. Only patients who met the criteria for a potentially curative operation were included. All patients were analyzed with regard to age and sex, primary tumor location, stage of the primary tumor, history of hepatic metastases, number of pulmonary metastases, pre-thoracotomy carcinoembryonic (CEA) serum antigen level, and the presence of thoracic lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, we immunohistochemically investigated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D, FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (FOS-B), and melanoma antigen (MAGE)-A in the surgical specimens of pulmonary metastatic lesions. The overall 3-year survival was 50.6 %. A significantly longer survival was observed with multivariate analysis in patients with a pre-thoracotomy serum carcinoembryonic antigen level of no more than 4.2 ng/mL ( P = 0.001), and Dukes stage A or B primary tumor ( P = 0.001). A significantly longer recurrence-free survival was observed with multivariate analysis in patients without thoracic lymph node involvement compared to patients with pulmonary and/or mediastinal lymph node metastases ( P = 0.006). The stage of the primary tumor remained significant ( P = 0.029), and FOS-B expression in tumor cells showed a trend towards favorable recurrence-free survival after pulmonary metastasectomy ( P = 0.059). No statistically significant difference was found in the overall survival rate or recurrence-free survival rate of patients with expression of VEGF-D or MAGE-A antigen in pulmonary metastatic tumor cells. Our results suggest that in addition to clinically prognostic factors, FOS-B expression has a debatable impact on patient survival. We conclude that the evaluation of molecular and clinical prognostic parameters at the time of pulmonary metastasectomy offers a greater understanding of the metastatic process and provides important information for patient selection."}

Between January 2001 and June 2007, a total of 778 UICC stage I-III CRC patients who underwent a radical resection and regular follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. Of these 778 CRC patients, 521 colon cancer and 257 rectal cancer cases were analyzed, respectively, to determine the predictors of early relapse postoperatively. These 778 patients were followed-up intensively, and their outcomes were investigated retrospectively. Out of 521 colon cancer patients, postoperative relapse after primary resection was found in 142 (27.3%) patients, and 77 (54.2%) of 142 recurrent colon cancer patients were classified as postoperative early relapse. Meanwhile, among 257 rectal cancer patients, postoperative relapse was found in 68 (26.5%) patients and 44 (64.7%) of 68 recurrent rectal cancer patients were identified as postoperative early relapse. Forty-nine (63.6%) of 77 early relapsed colon cancer patients were stage III, and likewise, 26 (59.1%) of 44 early relapsed rectal cancer patients were stage III. Univariately, postoperative early relapse of colon cancer patients was significantly correlated with the presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001), perineural invasion (P < 0.001), high postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P = 0.001), and type of surgery (P = 0.016). Using a Cox proportional hazards analysis, the presence of vascular invasion (P = 0.033), perineural invasion (P = 0.005), and high postoperative CEA levels (P = 0.001) were demonstrated to be independent predictors of postoperative early relapse of colon cancer patients, while in rectal cancer patients, both vascular invasion (P = 0.039) and perineural invasion (P = 0.008) were statistically significant predictors of early relapse by univariate analysis. Using a Cox proportional hazards analysis, only perineural invasion (P = 0.043) was an independent factor. Early relapse cases had significant lower overall survival rates than non-early relapse cases either in colon cancer (P < 0.001) or in rectal cancer (P = 0.0091) patients. This study suggests that vascular invasion, perineural invasion, and postoperative CEA level may be significant factors for postoperative early relapse of colon cancer; while only perineural invasion is considered to be a significant predictor in rectal cancer patients. Identification of these high-risk UICC stage I-III CRC patients of early relapse is important, and thus could help to define patients with this tumor entity for an enhanced follow-up and therapeutic program."}

The aims of this study are to examine the prognostic value of serum placenta growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and sFlt-1 and to compare them with the carcinoembryonic antigen levels in patients with colorectal cancer. Preoperative serum from 86 patients and serum from 30 healthy controls was included. The levels of sFlt-1, placenta growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum were assayed and correlated with the clinical stage results. Serum placenta growth factor, but not vascular endothelial growth factor, increased; sFlt-1 decreased in patients with preoperative colorectal cancer, compared with healthy controls. Higher preoperation serum placenta growth factor levels were associated with higher risk of recurrence. Preoperation serum placenta growth factor, but not carcinoembryonic antigen, was a prognostic indicator in patients with Stage III colorectal cancer. When we use the median level (20.6 pg/ml) of preoperative serum placenta growth factor as a cutoff point, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for tumor recurrence and survival was 80, 54, 80% and 70, 56, 70%, respectively.

We evaluated preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a prognostic factor for colorectal cancer and determined when surveillance of this marker was useful. Serum CEA was measured preoperatively in 1,263 patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer at 3-month intervals for the first 2 postoperative years and at 6-month intervals thereafter. Mean follow-up was 48 months (range 1-156 months). The 5-year disease-free survival was less in patients with a high preoperative serum CEA level (P<0.0001). Among patients with a tumor recurrence, 38.5% had high follow-up serum CEA levels. The number of patients with high postoperative serum CEA levels exceeded the number of patients with high preoperative levels. High preoperative and follow-up serum CEA levels were independent prognostic factors for tumor recurrence (P=0.003 and P<0.001, respectively). In patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels, CEA surveillance had a 92.3% positive predictive value (PPV) and a 96.1% negative predictive value (NPV). The mean interval between postoperative serum CEA elevation and the diagnosis of a tumor recurrence [diagnostic interval (DI)] was 2.5 months (range 5-17 months). The DI was 0 in 18.8% of patients with a tumor recurrence. High serum CEA levels preoperatively and at follow-up are prognostic factors for colorectal cancer. Postoperative serum CEA surveillance is used most effectively when patients have high preoperative serum CEA levels. Considering the DI of 0 in 18.8% of the patients, the current CEA surveillance schedule might be changed."}

Carcinoembriogenic antigen (CEA) is the most frequently used tumor marker in rectal cancer. A decrease in carcinoembriogenic antigen after radical surgery is associated with survival in these patients. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may lead to significant primary tumor downstaging, including complete tumor regression in selected patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that a decrease in CEA after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy could reflect tumor response to chemoradiotherapy, affecting final disease stage and ultimately survival. Patients with distal rectal cancer managed by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and available pretreatment and postchemoradiotherapy levels of CEA were eligible for the study. Outcomes studied included final disease stage, relapse, and survival, and these were compared according to initial CEA level, post-chemoradiotherapy CEA level, and the reduction in CEA. Overall 170 patients were included. Post-chemoradiotherapy CEA levels <5 ng/ml were associated with increased rates of complete clinical response and pathologic response. Additionally, postchemoradiotherapy CEA levels <5 ng/ml were associated with increased overall and disease-free survival (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03). There was no correlation between initial CEA level or reduction in CEA and complete response or survival. A postchemoradiotherapy CEA level <5 ng/ml is a favorable prognostic factor for rectal cancer and is associated with increased rates of earlier disease staging and complete tumor regression. Postchemoradiotherapy CEA levels may be useful in decision making for patients who may be candidates for alterative treatment strategies."}

The usefulness of preoperative CEA in CRC remains controversial as regards its biological function, and its use in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management and follow up of CRC patients. the aim of this study was to provide a critical and updated study for the value of CEA in CRC. From January 2000 to June 2005, a prospective randomized study involving 200 CRC patients for whom curative resection was performed, another 100 healthy persons as a control group was included. Basal CEA using chemilumescence technique and routine follow up were done. (1) The mean basal CEA in CRC patients (17.3 ng% +/- 1.67) was significantly higher than control (3.41 ng% +/- 1.1). (2) A significant linear association between basal CEA and Dukes' classes was evident with the mean basal CEA for Dukes' A, B, C were 7.8, 12.7, 25.8 respectively (expressed as ng%). (3) The validity of basal CEA in primary CRC diagnosis was highly positive (sensitivity 80%--PPV 86.95%--accuracy 73.66%), with hig her efficacy in advanced disease detection (sensitivity 93%--NPV 7%--accuracy 84.5%--odds ratio 30.3) and negative exclusion power for DFS prediction (specificity 13.84%). (4) The basal CEA was a discriminate factor in colorectal prognosis - B value (3.74). (5) Patients with CEA < or =5 ng% had better DFS (15%) and DFT (23.6 months) than those with CEA > 5 ng% as they had DFS (33.75%) and DFT (18.48 months). (6) Basal CEA above 15 ng% had a significant shift in the cumulative hazard of recurrence. The CEA is a metastasis potentiator. The high serum CEA in CRC screening programs should be considered a marker of malignancy especially in patients with appropriate symptoms. The preop CEA in CRC patients identifies subsets with favorable, indolent and uneven biological behavior (< or =5 ng%, < or =15 ng%, > 15 ng% respectively). Moreover, the addition of preop CEA level to conventional staging forms a strong prognostic tool and supplies adopted practice guideline initiative for follow up and therapy in CRC."}

Secondary analysis of data from the Clinical Outcomes of Surgical Therapy trial was performed by analyzing results according to TNM stage; early (stage I and IIA, 537 patients) and late (stage IIB and III, 254 patients) stage disease. Five-year recurrence rates were higher in patients with late (35.7%) versus early stage disease (9.5%). Early and late stage salvage rates, recurrence patterns and methods of first detection were compared by chi(2) test. Salvage rates for early- and late-stage disease patients with recurrence were the same (35.9% v 37%; P = .9, respectively). Median survival after second surgery after recurrence was 51.2 and 35.8 months for early- and late-stage patients, respectively. Single sites of first recurrence did not significantly differ between early and late stage, but multiple sites of recurrence occurred less often in early-stage patients (3.6% v 28.6%, for early v late, respectively; P < .001).

Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data, including primary tumor and CLM pathology results, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two time periods: a first period from January 1994 to January 2000 (n = 93), and a second period from February 2000 to January 2006 (n = 143). Global survival at 1, 3 and 5 years in patients undergoing hepatic resection was 91%, 54% and 47%, respectively. Patients with preoperative extrahepatic disease, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels over 20 ng/dL, more than four nodules or extrahepatic invasion at pathological analysis had worse survival. Tumor recurrence rate at 1 year was 48.3%, being more frequent in patients with preoperative and pathological extrahepatic disease and CEA levels over 20 ng/dL. Although patients in the second time period had more adverse prognostic factors, no differences in overall survival and recurrence were observed between the two periods.

We examined relationships between MVC and clinicopathologic factors or postoperative outcomes in 139 MLC patients who underwent hepatectomy between 1990 and 2006. CD34 expression was analyzed by the immunohistochemical method. MVC was associated with fibrous pseudocapsular formation on histological examination. By means of the modern Japanese classification of liver metastasis, poorer survival was associated with higher score, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, higher preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, fibrous pseudocapsular formation, and smaller surgical margin. Shorter disease-free survival was associated with higher score when the Japanese classification of liver metastasis was used, multiple or bilobar tumor, regional lymph node metastasis in primary colon carcinoma, preoperative CEA level, fibrous pseudocapsular formation, and smaller surgical margin (<5 mm). Higher MVC (>or=406/mm(2)) was associated with decreased disease-free and overall survival by univariate analysis (P = .034 and P = .021, respectively), and higher MVC represented an independently poor prognostic factor in overall survival by Cox multivariate analysis (risk ratio, 2.71; P = .023) in addition to histological differentiation.

Patients with recurrent tumors, resectable metastases, emergency operations, and non-resective surgery were excluded. Risk factors for increased postoperative morbidity and limited postoperative survival were identified by multivariate analyses. Patients with colon cancer (CC = 156) and rectal cancer (RC = 77) were comparable with regard to age, sex, comorbidity, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, hepatic spread, tumor grade, resection margins, 30-day mortality (CC 5.1%, RC 3.9%) and postoperative chemotherapy. pT4 tumors, carcinomatosis, and non-anatomical resections were more common in colon cancer patients, whereas enterostomies (CC 1.3%, RC 67.5%, p < 0.0001), anastomotic leaks (CC 7.7%, RC 24.2%, p = 0.002), and total surgical complications (CC 19.9%, RC 40.3%, p = 0.001) were more frequent after rectal surgery.

Prognostic factors for limited postoperative survival were hepatic tumor load >50%, pT4 tumors, lymphatic spread, R1-2 resection, and lack of chemotherapy. Palliative resection is associated with a particularly unfavorable outcome in rectal cancer patients presenting with a locally advanced tumor (pT4, expected R2 resection) or an extensive comorbidity, and in all CRC patients who show a hepatic tumor load >50%.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of HPLN involvement on survival after resection for CLM in the era of the new chemotherapy regimens. Between January 2000 and June 2006, 45 high risk consecutive patients presenting all with pathologically proven HPLN metastases were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Prognostic factors for survival and recurrence were analyzed. The mean follow-up was 25.5 months. HPLN involvement was located in area 1 in 17 patients, area 2 in 10, and both area 1 and 2 were involved in 18 patients. The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates were 29.7% and 17.3%, respectively. The median survival was 20.9 months. Three patients are alive and disease-free at 32.4, 33.5, and 46.9 months, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that the carcinoembryonic antigen blood level before hepatectomy, a curative intent R0 liver resection, the ratio of involved/total resected HPLN, and an adjuvant chemotherapy after liver resection were independent risk factors for overall survival. This study showed that the localization of HPLN metastases within area 1 or 2 does not anymore affect survival after CLM resection. Furthermore, this study provides a support to perform a routine HPLN dissection in high risk patients undergoing liver resection for CLM to recognize HPLN involvement, to improve the ratio of involved/total resected lymph nodes, and to assign the patients for an adjuvant chemotherapy. Finally, these results indicate that curative intent R0 liver resection with HPLN dissection can offer the only potential cure for patients with CLM who present with HPLN involvement."}

In this study, we have examined the prognostic significance of tumour-specific TATI expression in colorectal cancer, assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMAs) with tumour specimens from two independent patient cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to estimate time to recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival. In both cohorts, a high (>50% of tumour cells) TATI expression was an independent predictor of a significantly shorter overall survival. In cohort II, in multivariate analysis including age, gender, disease stage, differentiation grade, vascular invasion and carcinoembryonal antigen (CEA), high TATI expression was associated with a significantly decreased overall survival (HR=1.82; 95% CI=1.19-2.79) and disease-free survival (HR=1.56; 95% CI=1.05-2.32) in curatively treated patients. Moreover, there was an increased risk for liver metastasis in both cohorts that remained significant in multivariate analysis in cohort II (HR=2.85; 95% CI=1.43-5.66).

Disorders in the blood coagulation system are often associated with malignancy. Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have been shown to have abnormal data for various coagulation tests. We retrospectively analyzed the relation between the preoperative plasma fibrinogen level and tumor recurrence in 569 patients with CRC who underwent curative surgical resection and were followed up without adjuvant chemotherapy. The plasma fibrinogen level showed a positive association with tumor recurrence, age, sex, T stage, and TNM classification. When divided with the median value, hyperfibrinogenemia is positively correlated with tumor recurrence, although it lost independence in the multivariate analysis. In the C-reactive protein (CRP)-negative population, hyperfibrinogenemia is independently correlated with tumor recurrence and recurrence-free survival. In contrast, hyperfibrinogenemia has no effect on recurrence in CRP-positive patients. Hyperfibrinogenemia is clinically relevant in tumor recurrence before a systemic inflammatory response and thus can be a useful predictor of recurrence in the preinflammatory stage of CRC."}

Liver metastases develop in 50 percent of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Recurrent liver disease is usual. Repeat liver resection remains the only curative treatment. The aim of this study was to review our data on repeat hepatectomy and to analyze potential prognostic factors of survival. Patients who underwent repeat liver resection for metastases of colorectal carcinoma between January 1992 and August 2007 were identified from a prospective database and their medical records were analyzed. Of 62 patients who underwent a second hepatectomy, 15 underwent a third hepatectomy, and two underwent a fourth hepatectomy. There was no perioperative mortality. Morbidity was less than 20 percent for the first and second hepatectomies. Overall 5-year survival rate after first hepatectomy was 40 percent. Univariate analysis identified three risk factors confirmed by log-rank test and multivariate Cox regression analysis: serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations >5 ng/ml at first hepatectomy (HR = 2.265; CI = 1.140-4.497; P = 0.020), anatomic resection (HR = 2.124; CI = 1.069-4.218; P = 0.031), and tumors > or =3 cm at the second resection (HR = 2.039; CI = 1.013-4.103; P = 0.046). Our study shows that repeat hepatectomy for liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma may be performed with low mortality and morbidity. Preoperative concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen at first hepatectomy, tumor size, and type of anatomic resection are independent prognostic factors."}

However, a recurrent tumor was not detected by computed tomography(CT)and endoscopic examinations. A local recurrence in the right lateral abdominal wall was confirmed by PET-CT examination. We then conducted modified-FOLFOX6/FOLFIRI alternating regimen(modified- FIREFOX regimen). After this therapy, repeated PET-CT showed that the abnormal FDG-uptake concentration had disappeared, leading to a complete response(CR). The adverse event was grade 3 in leucopenia and grade 2 in gastrointestinal toxicity. She had maintained CR for the 12 months since undergoing chemotherapy. CEA and CA19-9 levels reduced to the normal range. We report this case with some review of the literature."}

Using standardized proformas, three blinded radiologists reviewed serial CT and magnetic resonance imaging in suspected cases of colorectal cancer recurrence in patients undergoing fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT imaging. Fifty eligible patients were included in the review. On follow-up, 23 patients had positive and 27 patients had negative diagnoses for colorectal cancer recurrence. Serial imaging review reduced the number of equivocal studies from 20 to 4 and unexplained carcinoembryonic antigen elevations from 17 to 10. Using fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT, the number of equivocal studies reduced from 20 to 6 and unexplained carcinoembryonic antigen elevations reduced from 17 to 10. Fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT altered management in 8 percent of patients (4/50, 95 percent CI, 0-16 percent). No significant differences were found between accuracy, sensitivity and specificity upon comparison of serial imaging review and fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT in detecting recurrent disease. Extra information was demonstrated on 18 fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT compared to serial imaging review in 8 of 50 patients and one patient had a positive incidental finding. With suspected recurrence, we recommend undertaking serial imaging review with careful correlation of suspicious findings with previous studies. Fluoro-2-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography-CT imaging was useful when findings remain equivocal after serial imaging review for colorectal cancer recurrence."}

The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and pathological parameters to improve prediction of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer. Between July 1995 and May 2007, 148 patients with primary rectal adenocarcinoma received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by mesorectal excision. Preoperative treatment included various protocols, UFT and leucovorin (28%) and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (72%). Clinical and pathological variables were evaluated in relation to patient outcomes. Thirteen percent of patients achieved a complete pathologic response. No response or minimal response as defined by Dworak (Tumor Regression Grade 0/1) was observed in 30 patients (20%). At a median follow-up of 37 months, the 3-year DFS and OS were 64% and 83%, respectively. Pre-treatment serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level </= 2.5 ng/ml was associated with higher DFS (74 vs. 53%; p = 0.018), higher complete pathologic responses (21 vs. 9%; p = 0.05), and less recurrences (24 vs. 44%; p = 0.014). The data suggest that a CEA level </= 2.5 ng/ml might be a predictor not only of tumor response, as has been suggested before, but also of DFS. This finding could be useful in the future to predict individual risk and to develop more aggressive or alternative strategies."}

We performed a comparative analysis of data from 244 patients who were resected for colorectal liver metastases between 1999 and 2004 at our institution. Seventy patients were aged 70 or older; they form the basis of this analysis. Twenty-nine patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (XELOX), 19; 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 10) prior to surgery. XELOX was associated with higher response rates to chemotherapy (CR + PR: XELOX 68% vs. 5-FU 0%, P = 0.001), and responding patients had a better overall (OS, P < 0.001) and recurrence free survival (RFS, P < 0.001) compared to others. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was the only factor on multivariate analysis predicting longer OS and RFS (P = 0.01 and P = 0.001). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be administered safely in patients older than 70 years and appears to be effective in prolonging long-term outcome. Patients responding to neoadjuvant treatment have a significantly better prognosis after liver resection."}

A biopsy of the lesion showed a group V, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A right hemicolectomy with a partial resection of the ileum and a lymphadenectomy was performed. Immunohistochemical staining during the pathological diagnosis showed the lesion to be colon metastasis from a serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin 7, carbohydrate antigen (CA)-125, and estrogen receptors, and negative for cytokeratin 20, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9.

Multivariate analysis revealed that peritoneal CEA and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 in PI were correlated with peritoneal metastasis and cytology. Level of peritoneal fluid CEA was statistically significantly correlated with recurrence and peritoneal metastatic recurrence in patients with negative peritoneal cytology. Cytology, peritoneal CEA, and peritoneal CA 19-9 showed correlations with cancer-free survival and overall survival. These correlations demonstrate the importance of continuous follow-up of peritoneal metastasis if there is positive cytology or an increase in CEA and CA 19-9 in peritoneal fluid."}

To our knowledge, eosinophilic (Langerhans' cell) granuloma of the lip has not been described. The case constituted a diagnostic challenge because of its unusual clinical presentation and its histopathological similarity to certain other benign and malignant entities. Because there was no other organ involved, the patient was treated with complete surgical excision without recurrence or other organ involvement in the 4-month follow-up period.

Independent prognostic factors were entered into a model of a clinical risk score. Median recurrence-free survival reached 24 months for all patients; median overall survival was 50 months. Only a synchronous manifestation of primary colorectal carcinoma and liver metastases, the presence of four or more metastases and a carcino-embryonic antigen level of 200 ng/ml or more significantly influenced recurrence-free and overall survival in the multivariate analysis. The derived risk stratification grouped the patients according to the following criteria: low risk, zero prognostic factors (n=112); intermediate risk, one factor (n=74); high risk, two or more factors (n=15). The median recurrence-free survival for low, intermediate and high risk were 30.0, 23.0 and 11.0 months, respectively; the median overall survival was 94.0, 40.0 and 33.0 months. Compared with the low-risk group, patients with intermediate risk demonstrated an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.57-fold for recurrence (P=0.018) and 1.91-fold for mortality (P=0.007). For the high-risk group, the HR rose significantly to 3.26 for recurrence (P<0.0005) and to 3.10 for mortality (P=0.001).

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent cancers in the Western world and represents a major health burden. CRC development is a multi-step process that spans 10-15years, thereby providing an opportunity for early detection and even prevention. As almost half of all patients undergoing surgery develop recurrent disease, surveillance is advocated, albeit with various means and intervals. Current screening and surveillance efforts have so far only had limited impact due to suboptimal compliance. Currently, CEA is the only biomarker in clinical use for CRC, but has suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. New and better biomarkers are therefore strongly needed. Non-invasive biomarkers may develop through the understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis. Three main pathways occur in CRC, including chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI) and epigenetic silencing through the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP). These pathways have distinct clinical, pathological, and genetic characteristics, which can be used for molecular classification and comprehensive tumour profiling for improved diagnostics, prognosis and treatment in CRC. Molecular-biological research has advanced with the sequencing of the human genome and the availability of genomic and proteomic high-throughput technologies using different chip platforms, such as tissue microarrays, DNA microarrays, and mass spectrometry. This review aims to give an overview of the evolving biomarker concepts in CRC, with concerns on methods, and potential for clinical implications for the surgical oncologist."}

The objective of this study was to compare the prognostic value of CEA both in serum and tumour tissue in CRC. A total of 173 patients with CRC in stages I-III were retrospectively assessed with the endpoint of recurrence or metastasis after curative operation. CEA was assessed both in serum and tumour tissue. 37.0% (64/173) patients had a high level of CEA in serum (S-CEA) while 39.3% (68/173) had high CEA in tumour tissue (T-CEA). There were no significant differences in clinico-pathological features between the low and high S-CEA or T-CEA groups. The high S-CEA group had a worse prognosis than the low S-CEA group but the difference was not significant. The high T-CEA group had a significantly poorer prognosis than the low T-CEA group (P = 0.028) in the univariate analysis. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the T-CEA was an independent prognosis factor in CRC. Because many factors would affect the concentration of S-CEA, there was no correlation between S-CEA and T-CEA directly. Our study suggests that a high T-CEA concentration may be a useful and independent predictor for poor outcome after surgery in CRC patients. It may be stronger than a high preoperative serum CEA level."}

Criteria studied consisted of age, sex, TNM stage, T-status, nodal status, distant metastasis, histological grade, lymphatic and vascular invasion, tumour location, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and liver function tests. Multivariate analysis was conducted using Cox regression analysis. The mean survival time for all patients was 42.8 (SEM = 2.8) months. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 72%, 54% and 47%, respectively. In univariate analysis, patients' age (P < 0.0001), TNM stage (P < 0.0001), T-status (P = 0.015), nodal status (P = 0.016), distant metastasis (P < 0.0001), grade (P = 0.005), lymphatic and vascular invasion (P < 0.0001) and presurgery CEA level > 5 ng/ml (P = 0.021) were found to be predictors that could affect survival. In Cox regression analysis, age (P < 0.0001), TNM stage (P = 0.001) and grade (P = 0.008) were determined as independent prognostic factors of survival. Age, TNM stage, T-status, nodal status, distant metastasis, grade, lymphatic and vascular invasion and presurgery CEA level can predict the postsurgical survival rate in patients with colorectal cancer."}

Little is known regarding the behaviour of serum anti-p53 antibodies (p53 Ab) in postoperative follow-up of patients with colorectal carcinoma and whether it can be used as an additional marker. The aim of this study was to evaluate usefulness of p53 Ab and CEA level for postoperative monitoring of recurrence or metastasis in patients after surgery due to colorectal cancer with normal pre-operative CEA levels and anti-p53 anitbodies. The research group consisted of 124 patients with colorectal cancer diagnosed on the basis of histopathological or cytological examination. Colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, serum CEA and anti-p53 antibody tests were done at the time of diagnosis and every 6-month from surgery. The occurrence of recurrence or metastasis was preceded by the appearance of anti-p53 antibodies 6 months earlier on average, in 5 patients, and the increased CEA level was preceded 9 months earlier on average, in 7 patients. The relationship between the increased CEA level and the occurrence of recurrence or metastasis was statistically significant (p < 0.0001); however statistically significant relationship was not found in the case of anti-p53 antibodies assessment. Performing these two tests simultaneously, at the same time with the same patients caused the increase of accuracy of recurrence or metastasis from 0.45 to 0.68. Multiple assessments of both serum p53 Ab and CEA during postoperative monitoring increase the probability of early detection of recurrence or metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer and normal CEA level before surgery."}

A 73-year-old man, who underwent a potentially curative resection of cancer of the descending colon 13 years before, was found to have a well-defined hepatic tumor on ultrasonography. A lateral segmentectomy was performed for a solitary hepatic tumor. Histopathological examination of the tumor indicated well differentiated adenocarcinoma compatible with the metastasis from the previous descending colon cancer. There have been no signs of recurrence for 5 years after the hepatic resection. This case suggests that distant metastasis from colorectal could be found several years after operation like in this case, and consequently long-term and strict follow-up is required after curative resection of the primary lesion."}

First-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with combinations of cetuximab and irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has shown promising efficacy. The clinical response to such treatment is generally assessed by tumor measurement through imaging. This study was performed to evaluate the correlation between serial changes in imaging results and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. In 64 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy we retrospectively analyzed the relationship between changes in serum CEA and changes in imaging results throughout the treatment course. Response in terms of serum CEA change was defined as a >/=50% drop in CEA level for more than 4 weeks. The sensitivity and specificity of serum CEA changes after targeted chemotherapy in relation to imaging results were 80.5% (33/41) and 73.9% (17/23), respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 78.1% (50/64). The progression-free survival time of responders assessed by serum CEA change was significantly longer than that of nonresponders (p=0.0091). Our results highlight the importance of serum CEA monitoring in assessing the response to targeted chemotherapy and in predicting the prognosis of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer."}

Recurrence, which occurs in about 20-30% of colorectal cancer patients after curative surgical treatment, is an important factor in determining prognosis. Therefore, early detection and prediction of recurrence is an important issue in the treatment of the disease. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomere DNA, thereby compensating for telomere loss that occurs with each replication cycle, and limits proliferation cells. Telomerase is expressed in the majority of primary human tumors and hTERT is considered one of the most important proteins affecting telomerase activity. We evaluated telomerase activity in mesenteric and peripheral blood samples in addition to hTERT expression in cancerous tissues by means of immunohistochemistry in 120 patients who underwent curative surgical treatment at our department. We investigated the factors correlated with recurrence. In univariate analysis, we found recurrence was significantly correlated with positive telomerase activity in the mesenteric vein (p=0.0021), positive telomerase activity in the peripheral vein (p=0.0032), histological type except well differentiated adenocarcinoma (p=0.0013), lymphatic infiltration (p=0.044), lymph node metastasis at surgery (p<0.0001), positive CEA (p=0.0004) and negative TERT immunoreactivity (p=0.012). In multivariate analysis, we found lymph node involvement at surgery (p=0.0045, hazard ratio: 6.21) and positive telomerase activity in peripheral vein (p=0.037, hazard ratio: 3.13) were significantly associated with the existence of recurrence. Our results show that measuring telomerase activity in peripheral blood samples is effective in predicting future recurrence to a degree greater than macroscopically examined tumor depth or other clinicopathological parameters."}

Updated National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) Laboratory Medicine Practice Guidelines for the use of tumor markers in the clinic have been developed. Published reports relevant to use of tumor markers for 5 cancer sites--testicular, prostate, colorectal, breast, and ovarian--were critically reviewed. For testicular cancer, alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase are recommended for diagnosis/case finding, staging, prognosis determination, recurrence detection, and therapy monitoring. alpha-Fetoprotein is also recommended for differential diagnosis of nonseminomatous and seminomatous germ cell tumors. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is not recommended for prostate cancer screening, but may be used for detecting disease recurrence and monitoring therapy. Free PSA measurement data are useful for distinguishing malignant from benign prostatic disease when total PSA is <10 microg/L. In colorectal cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen is recommended (with some caveats) for prognosis determination, postoperative surveillance, and therapy monitoring in advanced disease. Fecal occult blood testing may be used for screening asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. For breast cancer, estrogen and progesterone receptors are mandatory for predicting response to hormone therapy, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 measurement is mandatory for predicting response to trastuzumab, and urokinase plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 may be used for determining prognosis in lymph node-negative patients. CA15-3/BR27-29 or carcinoembryonic antigen may be used for therapy monitoring in advanced disease. CA125 is recommended (with transvaginal ultrasound) for early detection of ovarian cancer in women at high risk for this disease. CA125 is also recommended for differential diagnosis of suspicious pelvic masses in postmenopausal women, as well as for detection of recurrence, monitoring of therapy, and determination of prognosis in women with ovarian cancer. Implementation of these recommendations should encourage optimal use of tumor markers."}

This study aimed to evaluate the significance of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) as a prognostic marker for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-independent stage I or II colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Preoperative CRP was measured in 300 CRC patients to assess its relationships with clinicopathological factors and long-term survival. Based on the results of the initial study, the relationship between preoperative CRP and long-term survival was evaluated with reference to adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy in a further 128 stage II patients. CRP was associated with disease progression and factors reflecting nutritional depletion such as serum albumin, lymphocyte count and body weight loss ratio. In stage I or II patients, CRP could predict early disease recurrence, even when a CEA test could not. Multivariate analyses revealed that CRP was an independent prognostic variable in stage I or II patients. In the additional 128 stage II patients, CRP-positive patients showed a 3-year survival rate of only 55% without adjuvant chemotherapy, but this increased to 90% with adjuvant chemotherapy. CRP may be a potent prognostic and therapeutic indicator that provides valuable information for determining the need for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II CRC patients."}

To compare long-term outcome of R0 (negative margins) and R1 (positive margins) liver resections for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) treated by an aggressive approach combining chemotherapy and repeat surgery. Complete macroscopic resection with negative margins is the gold standard recommendation in the surgical treatment of CLM. However, due to vascular proximity or multinodularity, complete macroscopic resection can sometimes only be performed through R1 resection. Increasingly efficient chemotherapy may have changed long-term outcome after R1 resection. All resected CLM patients (R0 or R1) at our institution between 1990 and 2006 were prospectively evaluated. Exclusion criteria were: macroscopic incomplete (R2) resection, use of local treatment modalities, and presence of extrahepatic disease. We aimed to resect all identified metastases with negative margins. However, when safe margins could not be obtained, resection was still performed provided complete macroscopic tumor removal. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival were compared between groups, and prognostic factors were identified. Of 840 patients, 436 (52%) were eligible for the study, 234 (28%) of whom underwent R0 resection, and 202 (24%) underwent R1 resection. Number and size of CLM were higher, and distribution was more often bilateral in the R1 group. After a mean follow-up of 40 months, 5-year OS was 61% and 57% for R0 and R1 patients (P = 0.27). Five-year disease-free survival was 29% in the R0 group versus 20% in the R1 group (P = 0.12). In the R1 group, intrahepatic (but not surgical margin) recurrences were more often observed (28% vs. 17%; P = 0.004). Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level > or =10 ng/mL and major hepatectomy, but not R1 resection, were independent predictors of poor OS. Size > or =30 mm, bilateral distribution, and intraoperative blood transfusions independently predicted positive surgical margins. Despite a higher recurrence rate, the contraindication of R1 resection should be revisited in the current era of effective chemotherapy because survival is similar to that of R0 resection."}

The relapse-free time was investigated according to the CEA level. All patients underwent potentially curative resection for CRC without distant metastasis, classified as stage I, II, or III. The optimal cutoff value for preoperative serum CEA level was 10 ng/ml. Elevated preoperative serum CEA level was observed in 92 patients. Multivariate analysis identified tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and preoperative serum CEA level as independent predictive factors of recurrence. The relapse-free survival between CEA levels >10 ng/ml and <10 ng/ml significantly differed in patients with stage II and III. However, there was no significant difference in relapse-free survival between CEA levels >10 ng/ml and <10 ng/ml in patients with stage I.

A total of 43 patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer who had been treated by operation between 1989 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed and the factors, including doubling time of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA-dt), were analyzed. The 5-year overall survival rate after the operation for local recurrence was 50.8%. Gender, presence of distant metastasis, tumor size, CEA-dt and curability were found to be significant prognostic factors. A multivariate analysis demonstrated the presence of distant metastasis, CEA-dt and tumor size to be significant prognostic factors for overall survival. The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with a CEA-dt > or =150 days and a tumor size <5 cm were 76.9%.

A large slice technique was used to detect mesorectal metastasis and evaluate circumferential resection margin status. The relations between clinicopathologic characteristics, mesorectal metastasis and circumferential resection margin status were identified in patients with local recurrence of middle and lower rectal carcinoma. Local recurrence of middle and lower rectal carcinoma after curative resection occurred in 7 of the 56 patients (12.5%), and was significantly associated with family history (c2=3.929, P=0.047), high CEA level (c2=4.964, P=0.026), cancerous perforation (c2=8.503, P=0.004), tumor differentiation (c2=9.315, P=0.009) and vessel cancerous emboli (c2=11.879, P=0.001).

Survivin-expressing CCCs in peripheral blood samples obtained from 55 gastric cancer patients, 86 colorectal cancer patients, and 87 healthy volunteers were quantitatively examined by using a RT-PCR ELISA. Its clinical significance was statistically evaluated. The CCCs in the peripheral blood samples were detected in 45.4% and 44.0% of gastric and colorectal cancer patients, respectively. The presence of survivin-expressing CCCs was found to be significantly associated with the degree of tumor penetration, nodal status, and disease stages for both types of cancers. During a follow-up period of 36 months, patients who had a positive detection at the time of the initial assay test had a higher relapse rate than those who had a negative detection. As well, survivin-expressing CCCs were statistically shown to be a significant and independent predictor for cancer recurrence. The detection of survivin-expressing CCCs was also demonstrated to be more accurate in terms of predicting recurrence than traditional detection methods such as plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurements. The detection of CCCs expressing survivin mRNA could be used to accurately identify gastric and colorectal cancer patients with high risks of relapse."}

At a median interval of 2.9 months after radioembolization, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were demonstrated in seven, 25, and four patients, respectively. Median overall survival was 10.5 months, with improved survival for patients with a decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen level (19.1 months vs 5.4 months) and imaging response (29.3 months vs 4.3 months; P = .0001). Except for one instance of treatment-associated cholecystitis (grade 4 toxicity) and two gastric ulcers (grade 2 toxicity), no severe toxicities were observed. Hepatic (90)Y radioembolization can be performed with manageable toxicity in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases whose disease is refractory to chemotherapy. The antitumoral effect is supported by imaging and tumor marker responses. Further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal use of this emerging therapeutic modality."}

In this study we investigate the prognostic role of MASP-2 in patients curatively resected for primary CRC. Serum concentrations of MASP-2 were determined in 281 patients prior to surgery and 7 months postoperatively using a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay. End points were recurrent cancer and death within a median follow-up time of 7.9 years. The correlation between pre- and postoperative levels was 0.49. High postoperative levels of MASP-2 were significantly associated with poor survival [p = 0.04; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.80] and recurrence (p = 0.01, HR = 1.6, 95% CI, 1.1-1.6). The inclusion of age, gender, tumor localization, and Dukes stage in multivariate analysis demonstrated that high MASP-2 levels were independently predictive of survival (p = 0.01; HR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1.1-2.0) and recurrence (p = 0.01, HR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4). Combining pre- and postoperative MASP-2 levels did not improve the prediction of survival/recurrence. High postoperative levels of MASP-2 are associated with poor prognosis in patients curatively resected for CRC. A change of the MASP-2 level from preoperative levels was not, per se, predictive of recurrent disease or survival."}

Because recurrent adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum (CRC) can still be treated with acceptable 5-year survival rates, tumor surveillance plays an important role. Early detection of recurrent disease from CRC allows for effective treatment with intention for cure. This is why, in 2007, an interdisciplinary group modified the popular \"FAGAS\" criteria, a proposition for surveillance after curative resection of colorectal cancer. Proposed are the 3-monthly follow-up of the tumor marker CEA (carcino embryonic antigen), which, in case of lower sigmoid or rectal cancer, would be completed by rectosigmoidoscopy and endosonography every 6 months. As a major change liver sonography is now proposed to be replaced by annual thoraco-abdominal CT scan. Colonoscopy within the first year after resection has its place in the surveillance due to a high rate of metachronous secondary tumors missed in the initial endoscopy. Once completed it needs not to be repeated for at least 3 years. Only in cases where early stage CRC was been completely resected no schematic surveillance must take place."}

Clinic visits occurred more frequently and imaging studies were more commonly ordered at PMH than at CVH (P < .001). In contrast, CVH performed a higher median number of blood count and liver function tests (P = .001) per patient than PMH. The rates of carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring and surveillance colonoscopies were not statistically different between centers (P = .67 and P = .43, respectively).

For recurrences detected by surveillance, 38% were resectable, whereas only 18% of those detected by symptoms were resectable. Colorectal cancer surveillance revealed noticeable departures from ASCO guidelines, with the academic institution using a more intensive surveillance strategy with imaging studies than the community cancer center. Surveillance was associated with a higher proportion of resectable tumor recurrences than was detection by patient symptoms."}

This study was to examine the preoperative and early postoperative levels of CEA in CRC patients and calculate postoperative T1/2 of CEA to evaluate its potential role in prognosis prediction. In this retrospective study, 98 CRC patients who had preoperatively elevated levels of CEA (>or=5 microg/L) and serum CEA surveillance after radical operation were included. Postoperative T1/2 of CEA was calculated. Its correlation to prognosis was analyzed. Of the 98 patients, 21 had local recurrence or distant metastasis (recurrence group), 77 had no recurrence (non-recurrence group). The median value of preoperative CEA level was significantly higher in recurrence group than in non-recurrence group (23.9 microg/L vs. 12.3 microg/L, P=0.010); the median value of postoperative T1/2 of CEA was significantly longer in recurrence group than in non-recurrence group (6.2 days vs. 4.7 days, P=0.042); the later the TNM stage was, the poorer the prognosis was (P<0.001). The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate were significantly higher in the patients with postoperative T1/2 of CEA of <4.8 days than in those with T1/2 of >or=4.8 days (87% vs. 66%, P=0.017; 90% vs. 80%, P=0.032). The patients at earlier TNM stage had survival benefits both in DFS and OS: the 3-year DFS rates in stage I, II, and III patients were 100%, 93%, and 55%, respectively (P<0.001); the 3-year OS rates were 100%, 98%, and 77%, respectively (P=0.192). In Cox regression analysis, both TNM stage and postoperative T1/2 of CEA were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors of CRC patients with preoperatively elevated CEA level.

No human anti-mouse antibody response was observed after the diagnosis dose; however, 10 of the 13 treated patients developed human anti-mouse antibody approximately 3 months later. Two treated patients presented extrahepatic metastases at the time of RIT (one bone and one abdominal node) and two relapsed within 3 months of RIT (one in the lung and the other in the liver). Two patients are still alive, and one of these is disease-free at 93 months after resection. At a median follow-up of 127 months, the median disease-free survival is 12 months and the median overall survival is 50 months.

Regenerating gene type IV (RegIV) is a candidate marker for cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, its potential as a novel marker for the detection of gastric cancer peritoneal micrometastases was examined. RegIV mRNA levels in the peritoneal washes of 95 gastric cancer patients and 22 with benign disease were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. To examine whether expression of RegIV enhance tumorigenicity or not, thirty two mice were injected intraperitoneally or subcutaneously with RegIV transfectants of TMK-1 cells, parental TMK-1 cells, or neomycin control transfectants. RegIV expression was markedly higher in patients with peritoneal metastases compared to those without. The level of RegIV mRNA in gastric cancer patients was related to the extent of wall penetration. A cut-off value for RegIV-positive expression was based on an analysis of negative control patients with benign disease, and gastric cancer patients above the cut-off value constituted the micrometastasis (MM+) group. Based on this criteria, 3 out of 43 T1 or T2 cases were MM+ (93% specificity). Among 15 patients with peritoneal dissemination (7 out of 15 cases were positive by cytology), 14 cases were positive for RegIV expression (93% sensitivity), while analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA failed to detect micrometastases in 4 cases (73% sensitivity). Combined analysis of CEA and RegIV improved the accuracy of diagnosis to 100%. The prognosis of RegIV-positive cases was significantly worse than that of RegIV-negative cases. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model suggested that RegIV may be an independent prognostic factor. Stable expression of RegIV significantly enhanced peritoneal metastasis in an animal model of gastric cancer. These findings suggest that RegIV mRNA expression has the potential to serve as a novel marker for detecting peritoneal dissemination in gastric cancer."}

Bevacizumab is typically well tolerated and its major side effects include hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation and arterial thrombotic events. Although exfoliative dermatitis has been described as a side effect in 19% of patients, skin rash (type unspecified) has rarely been described in patients following infusion of bevacizumab. We recently reported the fi rst patient with colon cancer manifesting a correlation between rash and a positive drug response with bevacizumab. A 49-year old male with T3 N1 M1 rectal carcinoma received modified FOLFOX-6/bevacizumab, which he tolerated very well except for grade 2 skin rash related to bevacizumab. The rash continued to progress as the serum carcinoembryonic antigen decreased significantly. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan confirmed response to FOLFOX/bevacizumab. We therefore believe that this rash was linked to bevacizumab administration and correlated with response to therapy. Grade 1/2 rash has been described in patients after infusion of bevacizumab in initial phase I and II studies.

Out of 438 patients, 80 CRC patients were classified to preoperative (-)/postoperative (-), 221 patients were preoperative (+)/postoperative (-), while 137 patients were preoperative (+)/postoperative (+). Univariately, postoperative relapse was significantly correlated with depth of invasion (P = 0.032), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), vascular invasion (P = 0.001), perineural invasion (P = 0.013), and persistent presence of CTCs (P < 0.001).

Furthermore, the persistent presence of CTCs was strongly correlated with poorer relapse-free survival rates (all P < 0.001). The promising results of this study suggest that persistent presence of postoperative CTCs may be a crucial prognostic factor adjuvant to conventional tumor markers in CRC patients who have undergone curative resection.

PTEN is a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 10. Deficient PTEN expression leads to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (pAkt) signaling pathway, which may contribute to multiple human cancers. The relation between PTEN expression and Akt activation is still unclear in colorectal cancers and adenomatous polyps. Moreover, PTEN and pAkt expression in relation to demographic, tumoral, and outcome variables remains to be elucidated. PTEN and pAkt expression were evaluated in 76 primary colorectal cancers and 25 adenomatous colorectal polyp tissues using immunohistochemical staining on paraffin-embedded sections. PTEN and pAkt expression were compared with clinicopathologic features of colorectal cancers. The relationship between PTEN and pAkt expression was also investigated. In colorectal cancers, pAkt expression was found to be significantly higher than polyps (P = .007). On the other hand, PTEN expression was significantly lower in polyps (P <.0001). In colorectal cancer patients, PTEN expression showed a negative correlation with young age, female sex, and left-sided (distal) tumors. On multivariate analysis, low PTEN expression (PTEN loss) was noted as an independent parameter for local recurrence (P = .024).

Means of detection were: symptoms in 2 (peritoneal disease, 8%), increasing CEA in 15 (63%), routine imaging in 6 (25%), and abdominal CT-scan in one patient. Curative resection of recurrent disease was possible in ten patients (42%): in 6/15 recurrences detected by CEA, in 3/6 recurrences detected by routine imaging, in 1 liver metastasis detected by CT and in none of the symptomatic patients. A CEA level increasing above 5.0 microg/L was the most important diagnostic tool. However, one quarter of the recurrences were detected by routine imaging and half of them could be resected for cure. These data support routine imaging during follow-up."}

Patients with primary CRC aged 19-75 years, treated with curative intent surgery from July 2000 to December 2002 were identified from a prospective database. Compliance with FU was assessed primarily by chart review. We also surveyed patients and providers to explore attitudes and barriers to surveillance adherence using tenets of the Health Belief Model. 96 patients met inclusion criteria and were appropriate for FU. Median FU was 34 months. Guideline targets were met for 70% of clinic visits; 49% of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) determinations; and 62% of abdominal imaging studies. Post-operative colonoscopy did not occur in 6/93 patients. Seventy per cent of health care providers and 55% of patients completed a survey. Access to testing and confusion about which provider orders investigations were identified as important barriers to FU. Patterns of CRC FU were widely variable despite implementation of a guideline. Despite patient and provider agreement with the principles of CRC FU, adoption was inhibited by confusion among multiple providers regarding investigation coordination."}

Sigmoidectomy and liver resection were performed. Histological response was Grade 1b at liver metastasis. The patient was discharged and had an uneventful recovery. Six months after surgery, CEA and CA19-9 decreased to normal level, and the patient is free of recurrence.

To determine the safety and efficacy of efficacy of percutaneous cryosurgery for treatment of patients with hepatic colorectal metastases. Three hundred and twenty-six patients with non-resectable hepatic colorectal metastases underwent percutaneous cryosurgery under the guidance of ultrasound or CT. Follow-up was 1 mo after cryosurgery and then every 4 mo thereafter by assessment of tumor markers, liver ultrasonography, and abdominal CT. For lesions suspicious of recurrence, a liver biopsy was performed and subsequent repeat cryosurgery was given if histology was positive for cancer. All patients underwent a total of 526 procedures of cryosurgery. There were 151 patients who underwent repeat procedures of cryosurgery for recurrent tumors in the liver and extrahepatic places. At 3 mo after cryosurgery, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in 197 (77.5%) patients who had elevated markers before cryosurgery decreased to normal range. Among 280 patients who received CT following-up, cryotreated lesions showed complete response (CR) in 41 patients (14.6%), partial response (PR) in 115 patients (41.1%), stable disease (SD) in 68 patients (24.3%) and progressive disease (PD) in 56 patients (20%). The recurrence rate was 47.2% during a median follow-up of 32 mo (range, 7-61). Sixty one percent of the recurrences were seen in liver only and 13.9% in liver and extrahepatic areas. The recurrence rate at cryotreated site was only 6.4% for all cases. During a median follow-up of 36 mo (7-62 mo), the median survival of all patient was 29 mo (range 3-62 mo). Overall survival was 78%, 62%, 41%, 34% and 23% at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively, after the treatment. Patients with tumor size less than 3 cm, tumor in right lobe of liver, lower CEA levels (<100 ng/dL) and post-cryosurgery TACE had higher survival rate. There was no significant difference in terms of survival based on the number of tumors, pre-cryosurgery chemotherapy and the timing of the development of metastases (synchronous vs metachronous). Patients who underwent 2-3 procedures of cryosurgery had increased survival compared to patients who received cryosurgery once only. There was no intra-cryosurgery mortality. Main adverse effects, such as hepatic bleeding, cryoshock, biliary fistula, liver failure, renal insufficiency and liver abscess were only observed in 0.3%-1.5% of patients. Percutaneous cryosurgery was a safe modality for hepatic colorectal metastases.

Adjuvant therapy for Stage II colon cancer remains controversial but may be considered for patients with high-risk features. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of commonly reported clinicopathologic features of Stage II colon cancer to identify high-risk patients. We analyzed a prospectively maintained database of patients with colon cancer who underwent surgical treatment from 1990 to 2001 at a single specialty center. We identified 448 patients with Stage II colon cancer who had been treated by curative resection alone, without postoperative chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 53 months, 5-year disease-specific survival for this cohort was 91 percent. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified three independent features that significantly affected disease-specific survival: tumor Stage T4 (hazard ratio (HR), 2.7; 95 percent confidence interval (CI), 1.1-6.2; P = 0.02), preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen > 5 ng/ml (HR, 2.1; 95 percent CI, 1.1-4.1; P = 0.02), and presence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion (HR, 2.1; 95 percent CI, 1-4.4; P = 0.04). Five-year disease-specific survival for patients without any of the above poor prognostic features was 95 percent; five-year disease-specific survival for patients with one of these poor prognostic features was 85 percent; and five-year disease-specific survival for patients with > or = 2 poor prognostic features was 57 percent. Patients with Stage II colon cancer generally have an excellent prognosis. However, the presence of multiple adverse prognostic factors identifies a high-risk subgroup. Use of commonly reported clinicopathologic features accurately stratifies Stage II colon cancer by disease-specific survival. Those identified as high-risk patients can be considered for adjuvant chemotherapy and/or enrollment in investigational trials."}

Hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) may offer good long-term survival. The impact of the tumor-free surgical margin on long-term results remains controversial, and we have assessed this component in 185 patients. Between 1992 and 2005, 185 patients underwent primary hepatectomy with curative intent for CRLM (which originated from colon/rectum 133/52, synchronous/metachronous 66/119, and single/multiple 100/85). In this study, 105 major and 80 minor hepatectomies were evaluated; 133 hepatectomies had pedicle clamping. Operative mortality was 1.1%, morbidity was 25.7%, and blood transfusion requirement was 27.6%. Stratification of tumor-free margin in the patients with R0 liver resection was greater than or equal to 10 mm (63.0% of patients), 6-9 mm (11.4% of patients), 3-5 mm (16.5% of patients), and less than or equal to 2 mm (9.1% of patients), with infiltrated margin in the remainder (R1 liver resection 4.9% of the total number of patients). The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 54.9%, 37.9%, and 22.9%, respectively. Global and surgical margin recurrence rates increased as the tumor-free margin decreased (P = .01 and P < .001, respectively). At univariate analysis, the width of surgical margin (P < .001), transfusion requirement, major hepatectomy, R1 resection, number of metastases, high preoperative CEA, and increasing tumor size (P value from .001 to .03) were associated with lesser rates of long-term survival. A similar association was found with disease-free survival. At multivariate analysis, width of surgical margin was the only independent predictor of both overall (P = .003) and disease-free (P < .001) survival. Although smaller margins were associated with synchronicity, increasing number of, and with bilobar distribution of, metastases which contributed to explain recurrences away from the margin), the width of surgical margin maintained the prominent impact on outcome. In our patients, the width of the surgical margin was a powerful prognostic factor after hepatectomy for CRLM. A resection margin less than or equal to 5 mm was associated with a greater risk of recurrence on the surgical margin, with a lesser rate of overall and disease-free survival."}

Although retrospective studies have demonstrated survival benefit from hepatectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer, few studies have examined patients with multiple bilobar metastases to identify survival-related factors throughout their course. Among 277 patients with R0 resection for liver metastases from colorectal cancer, 79 patients had 4 or more lesions in a bilobar distribution. To determine impact on long-term outcome, we compared clinicopathologic factors retrospectively between 3-year survivors and patients who died less than 3 years after hepatectomy. Among 79 patients with 4 or more bilobar metastases, 5 patients (6.3%) attained prolonged remission after initial hepatectomy. By multivariate analysis, a lack of adjuvant chemotherapy compromised survival (relative risk or RR, 2.21; P = .036), as did prehepatectomy carcinoembryonic antigen exceeding 12 ng/mL (RR, 2.12; P = .039). Treatment-related variables such as repeat resections in the event of liver recurrence (P < .01) or lung metastases (P < .05), as well as adjuvant chemotherapy (P < .01), differed significantly between 3-year survivors and nonsurvivors, as did the differences in number of metastases, maximum size of metastases, concomitant extrahepatic metastases at the time of initial hepatectomy, and disease-free interval preceding initial recurrence. Although not effective as a sole treatment for multiple hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer, liver resection is important in multimodal therapy. Reoperations for recurrence of metastases, followed by additional chemotherapy, frequently obtained long survival."}

Estimates of recurrence after curative colon cancer surgery are integral to patient care, forming the basis of cancer staging and treatment planning. The categoric staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is commonly used to convey risk by grouping patients based on anatomic elements. Although easy to implement, there remains significant heterogeneity within each stage grouping. In the era of multimodality treatment, a more refined tool is needed to predict recurrence. An institutional database of 1,320 patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer was used to develop a nomogram to estimate recurrence after curative surgery. Prognostic factors were assessed with multivariable analysis using Cox regression, whereas nonlinear continuous variables were modeled with cubic splines. The model was internally validated with bootstrapping, and performance was assessed by concordance index and a calibration curve. The colon cancer recurrence nomogram predicted relapse with a concordance index of 0.77, improving on the stratification provided by either the AJCC fifth or sixth staging scheme. Factors in the model included patient age, tumor location, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen, T stage, numbers of positive and negative lymph nodes, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and use of postoperative chemotherapy. Using common clinicopathologic factors, the recurrence nomogram is better able to account for tumor and patient heterogeneity, thereby providing a more individualized outcome prognostication than that afforded by the AJCC categoric system. By identifying both the high- and low-risk patients within any particular stage, the nomogram is expected to aid in treatment planning and future trial design."}

Clinical, pathologic, and complete follow-up data were prospectively collected from 929 consecutive patients undergoing primary (n = 925) or repeat hepatic resection (n = 80) for colorectal liver metastases at a tertiary referral center from 1987 to 2005. Parametric survival analysis was used to identify predictors of cancer-specific survival and develop a predictive model. The model was validated using measures of discrimination and calibration. Postoperative mortality and morbidity were 1.5% and 25.9%, respectively. 5-year and 10-year cancer-specific survival were 36% and 23%. On multivariate analysis, 7 risk factors were found to be independent predictors of poor survival: number of hepatic metastases >3, node positive primary, poorly differentiated primary, extrahepatic disease, tumor diameter > or =5 cm, carcinoembryonic antigen level >60 ng/mL, and positive resection margin. The first 6 of these criteria were used in a preoperative scoring system and the last 6 in the postoperative setting. Patients with the worst postoperative prognostic criteria had an expected median cancer-specific survival of 0.7 years and a 5-year cancer-specific survival of 2%. Conversely, patients with the best prognostic postoperative criteria had an expected median cancer-specific survival of 7.4 years and a 5-year cancer-specific survival of 64%.

The overall 5-year survival was 27% (44% R0, 38% R1 and 17% R2-stage). Corresponding survival/local recurrence rates were 52%/27% for R0- and 14%/63% for R1-stage. No R2-resected survived 4 years. A normal pretreatment CEA level was significantly associated with increased survival but normalization following preoperative therapy was not associated with an improvement in prognosis. Survival and local recurrence were also significantly influenced by the type of primary operation. Several factors were significant for the prediction of an R0-resection in univariate analysis, but only CEA and symptoms at the time of recurrence predicted an R0-resection in multivariate analysis. A long latency time to recurrence did not significantly influence prognosis. Preoperative irradiation and surgery can result in an R0-resection and a long survival in patients with recurrence after initial treatment for rectal or rectosigmoid cancer. Also patients with an R1-resection can benefit from surgery since a substantial number will die without further local recurrence. An R0-resection is the main prognostic factor followed by CEA level, sex and type of primary operation. Normalization of CEA after preoperative treatment is not of prognostic significance.

We treated patients-post-hepatic resection-with anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody vaccines to the tumor-associated antigens carcinoembryonic antigen (CeaVac) and human milk fat globule (TriAb), both of which are co-expressed in more than 90% of colorectal cancer patients. Vaccinations commenced 6-12 weeks post-hepatic resection and consisted of four biweekly treatments of 2 mg CeaVac and TriAb, then monthly treatments for 2 years, then on every other month for 3 years.

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen and/or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were periodically assessed in 258 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer (n = 161) or curative resection for colorectal cancer (n = 97). The frequency of false-positive findings for the tumor markers, the sensitivity of the marker monitoring for detection of the recurrence, and the characteristics of such cases were compared between these two cancer groups. During the median follow-up period of 30 months, recurrence developed in 14% of gastric cancer and 23% of colorectal cancer patients. A false positive with the tumor marker was frequently observed in patients after gastrectomy compared with after colorectal surgery. The sensitivity of the marker monitoring regarding early detection of recurrence was higher in patients with colorectal cancer than those with gastric cancer, especially in cases of advanced stage. As a result, the accuracy of marker monitoring for the detection of recurrence was higher in patients after the resection of colorectal cancer than that of gastric cancer. Surgeons and oncologists should thus be aware that the role of the tumor marker monitoring after a curative operation differs between patients with gastric and colorectal cancers."}

We compared outcomes of surgery and radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) in patients with metachronous liver metastases. Between October 1995 and December 2005, 59 patients underwent hepatic resection and 30 underwent RFA for metachronous liver metastases. Patients with extra-hepatic metastases, those who underwent both types of treatment, and those with synchronous hepatic metastasis were excluded. The two groups had similar mean age, sex ratio, comorbid medical conditions, primary disease stage, and frequency of solitary metastases. Preoperative mean serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was significantly higher in the RFA group (13.4 ng/mL vs. 7.7 ng/mL; p = 0.02). Mean diameter of hepatic metastases was significantly greater in the resection than in the RFA group (3.1 cm vs. 2.0 cm; p = 0.001). Recurrence after treatment of metastasis was observed in 18 of 30 (60.0%) RFA and 33 of 59 (56%) resection patients. Local recurrence at the RFA site was observed in 7 of 30 (23%) patients. Time to recurrence (15 vs. 8 months, p = 0.02) and overall survival (56 vs. 36 months, p = 0.005) were significantly longer in the resection than in the RFA group. In the 69 patients with solitary metastases of diameter </=3 cm, time to recurrence (p = 0.004) and overall survival were significantly greater in the resection group. Compared with hepatic resection, RFA for metachronous hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer was associated with higher local recurrence and shorter recurrence-free and overall survival rates, even in patients with solitary, small (</=3 cm) lesions."}

The prognostic value of the degree of apoptosis in colorectal cancer is controversial. This study evaluates the putative clinical usefulness of measuring caspase-3 activity as a prognostic factor in colonic cancer patients receiving 5-fluoracil adjuvant chemotherapy. We evaluated caspase-3-like protease activity in tumours and in normal colon tissue. Specimens were studied from 54 patients. These patients had either stage III cancer (Dukes stage C) or high-risk stage II cancer (Dukes stage B2 with invasion of adjacent organs, lymphatic or vascular infiltration or carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] >5). Median follow-up was 73 months. Univariate analysis was performed previously to explore the relation of different variables (age, sex, preoperative CEA, tumour size, Dukes stage, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, caspase-3 activity in tumour and caspase-3 activity in normal mucosa) as prognostic factors of tumour recurrence after chemotherapy treatment. Subsequently, a multivariate Cox regression model was performed. Median values of caspase-3 activity in tumours were more than twice those in normal mucosa (88.1 vs 40.6 U, p=0.001), showing a statistically significant correlation (r=0.34). Significant prognostic factors of recurrence in multivariate analysis were: male sex (odds ratio, OR=3.53 [1.13-10.90], p=0.02), age (OR=1.09 [1.01-1.18], p=0.03), Dukes stage (OR=1.93 [1.01-3.70]), caspase-3 activity in normal mucosa (OR=1.02 [1.01-1.04], p=0.017) and caspase-3 activity in tumour (OR=1.02 [1.01-1.03], p=0.013). Low caspase-3 activity in the normal mucosa and tumour are independent prognostic factors of tumour recurrence in patients receiving adjuvant 5-fluoracil-based treatment in colon cancer, correlating with poor disease-free survival and higher recurrence rate."}

Intensive follow-up post surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) is thought to improve long-term survival principally through the earlier detection of recurrent disease. This paper aims to calculate the additional resource and cost implications of intensive follow up post-CRC resection, examine the possibility of risk-stratifying this follow up to those at highest risk of recurrence and investigating the impact that population screening might have on the future cost and outcomes of follow up. Two follow-up regimens were constructed: the 'standard' follow-up protocol used the principles of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines whilst the 'intensive' follow-up protocol used the most intensive arm of the follow up after colorectal surgery (FACS) trial. Using ONS data, the number of CRC diagnosed in a given year was calculated for 2003 and projected for 2016 based on the population of England and Wales. The resource requirements and costs of follow up over a 5-year period were then calculated for the two time periods. Risk stratifying entry to follow up and the introduction of population CRC screening were then considered. For the 2003 cohort, an intensive follow-up program would detect 853 additional resectable recurrences over 5 years with 795 fewer subjects requiring palliative care. An additional 26 302 outpatient appointments, 181 352 CEA tests and 79 695 CT scans over 5 years would be required to achieve this. The cost of investigating subjects who would never develop detectable recurrences was pound15.6 million. The cost per additional resectable recurrence was pound18 077, a figure also found for a nonscreened population in 2016. An identical intensive follow-up policy with biennial FOBT screening in 2016 saw the cost per additional resectable recurrence rise to pound36 255. Intensive follow up will detect considerably more resectable recurrences but at considerable cost and it is unclear if such follow up will be achievable in an already over-stretched NHS. If population-based CRC screening increases the number of Dukes A cancers this may offer the possibility of risk-stratifying future follow up to those at highest risk of recurrence; minimizing tests on those who will never have recurrent disease and better utilizing our scarce resources."}

A prospective cohort study of 204 M0 patients given >45 Gy preoperatively (median age 66 years; 29% women; tumour level <16 cm from the anal verge). Multivisceral and/or pelvic wall resections were performed in 61% of the patients. R0, R1 and R2 resections were achieved in 74%, 21% and 5%. Five-year survival was 52% for all patients, 60% for R0 resections, 31% for R1 and 0% for R2. The calculated 5-year recurrence rates were 13% for R0 resections and 24% for R1 resections (p<0.035). R-stage, N-stage, age, type of rectal resection and pelvic wall resection remained significant in Cox multivariate analysis for survival. Regarding local recurrence, the following parameters were independent: N-stage, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) response and pelvic wall resection. Medium high tumour level and reduced histopathological differentiation are important individual factors that seem to predict increased risk for not obtaining a R0 resection. After preoperative irradiation and surgery, about 50% of the patients with locally advanced rectal cancer without overt metastases (M0) can be cured."}

Fluorescence spectroscopy of biomolecules is considered a promising method to discriminate in vivo normal tissue from malignant tissue at various sites including breast, cervix, lung, and colon. However, only few studies have been reported on the feasibility of exploiting fluorescence spectroscopy of blood to characterize pathological changes usable in diagnostic oncology. In this study, the fluorescence characteristics of human blood plasma have been studied in the visible spectral range in an attempt to discriminate patients with colorectal cancer from subjects of a control population. The study involved 341 subjects, including 169 blood donors with no evidence of disease, 143 patients bearing colorectal adenocarcinomas (36 in the colon, 38 in the sigmoid colon and 69 in the rectum), 11 patients with local relapse, 10 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and 8 with single adenomas. Blood samples were collected from all subjects and plasma fluorescence spectrum was analyzed using a conventional spectrofluorometer. The intensity of a fluorescence emission peak around 615-635 nm, which could reasonably be ascribed to endogenous porphyrins, was significantly different between patients bearing colorectal cancer and blood donors. The diagnostic capacity of the method was tested by ROC analysis, which resulted in an area under the curve of 0.72, close to that reported for the CEA test. These results, although preliminary, suggest the potential of fluorescence measurements of blood plasma as an additional method for diagnostic application in colon cancer."}

The lymph nodes which had previously been considered negative of metastasis by conventional examination were submitted to immunohistochemical examination to identify the micrometastases using anti-cytokeratin antibody. The correlation between micrometastasis and pathological factors were analyzed. One thousand and seven LNs were collected from 31 patients. One hundred and five LNs were found positive by conventional examination, and the mean diameter was (5.5 +/- 3.1) mm. The mean diameter of conventional negative LNS was (2.8 +/- 1.5) mm.

The aim of this study was to determine whether our constructed high-sensitivity colorimetric membrane-array method could detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and so identify a subgroup of patients who are at high risk for relapse. Adjuvant chemotherapy is not routinely recommended in patients diagnosed with UICC stage II CRC. However, up to 30% of patients with stage II disease relapse within 5 years of surgery from recurrent or metastatic disease. The identification of reliable prognostic factors for high-risk stage II CRC patients is imperative. Membrane-arrays consisting of a panel of mRNA markers that included human telomerase reverse transcription (hTERT), cytokeratin-19 (CK-19), cytokeratin-20 (CK-20), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA were used to detect CTCs in the peripheral blood of 194 stage II CRC patients who underwent potentially curative (R0) resection between January 2002 and December 2005. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cDNA were amplified by RT-PCR from the peripheral blood samples, which were then hybridized to the membrane-array. All patients were followed up regularly, and their outcomes were investigated completely. Overall, 53 of 194 (27.3%) stage II patients were detected with the expression of all 4 mRNA markers using the membrane-array method. After a median follow up of 40 months, 56 of 194 (28.9%) developed recurrence/metastases postoperatively. Univariately, postoperative relapse was significantly correlated with the depth of invasion (P < 0.001), the presence of vascular invasion (P < 0.001), the presence of perineural invasion (P = 0.048), the expression of all 4 mRNA markers (P < 0.001), and the number of examined lymph nodes (P = 0.031). Meanwhile, using a multivariate logistic regression analysis, T4 depth of tumor invasion (P = 0.013), the presence of vascular invasion (P = 0.032), and the expression of all 4 mRNA markers (P < 0.001) were demonstrated to be independent predictors for postoperative relapse. Combination of the depth of tumor invasion, vascular invasion, and all 4 mRNA markers as predictors of postoperative relapse showed that patients with any 1 positive predictor had a hazard ratio of about 27-fold to develop postoperative relapse (P < 0.001; 95% CI = 11.42-64.40). The interval between the detection of all 4 positive molecular markers and subsequently developed postoperative relapse ranged from 4 to 10 months (median: 7 months). Furthermore, the expression of all 4 mRNA markers in all stage II CRC patients, or either stage II colon or rectal cancer patients were strongly correlated with poorer relapse-free survival rates by survival analyses (all P < 0.001). The pilot study suggests that the constructed membrane-array method for the detection of CTCs is a potential auxiliary tool to conventional clinicopathological variables for the prediction of postoperative relapse in stage II CRC patients who have undergone curative resection."}
{"id": "18023132", "title": "Resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma.", "content": "Resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma. Although pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) often represent systemic and uncontrolled tumour growth, in a number of patients lung disease is limited and the patient remains well. When the metastases can be removed, long term survival is a possibility, with 5- and 10-year survivals in the order of 44% and 25%. Chemotherapy, the only alternative treatment only very rarely leads to survival beyond 24 months. Pulmonary metastases which are suitable for resection are usually detected on chest radiography, especially when carried out during monitoring of patients. They are rarely a cause of symptoms and the majority of patients have otherwise healthy lungs. CT scans supplemented by PET scans usually confirm the diagnosis, but percutaneous biopsy is sometimes necessary to exclude a primary lung cancer. The criteria for resecting CRC pulmonary metastases are (1) the primary tumour is controlled or is controllable; (2) complete resection is possible; and (3) the patient has adequate pulmonary reserve to tolerate the planned resection. Surgical approaches include posterolateral thoracotomy, staged bilateral thoracotomies, median sternotomy, clamshell incision, and video-assisted thoracic surgery. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. The majority of patients having resection of pulmonary metastases from CRC recover well with very few post-operative complications. Following resection favourable prognostic factors include a long disease-free interval, small number and small size of metastases, a normal carcinoembryonic antigen level, and an absence of concomitant liver metastases and mediastinal lymph node spread. Surgery for pulmonary metastases of CRC remains the best means of local control and the best way to render the patient disease-free. Patients with complete resection of pulmonary metastases have an improved long-term survival when compared to patients with unresected metastases."}

Analysis of the above indicators was performed by immunohistochemistry on 162 CC patient samples with curative intention surgery. Clinicopathological data included tumour grade, vascular and nervous invasion, production of mucin, lymphatic permeation and carcinoembryonic antigen levels. p53 protein was overexpressed in 58%, bcl-2 overexpression in 21.5%, Ki-67 in 60.1% and anti-VIII factor stained positive in 40.16% of the cases. Multiple regression analysis showed that some molecular markers were correlated. A significant relationship was seen between p53 and Ki-67, and bcl-2 and p53, but there was no correlation between bcl2 and Ki- 67 overexpression. Stepwise regression selected Ki-67 and anti-VIII factor as the best combination of variables capable of predicting both disease-specific and diseasefree survival. Only Ki-67 and anti-VIII factor were shown to be useful for the prediction of outcome and recurrence rate in curatively treated CC patients. In conjunction with clinical and pathological staging, they may provide a stronger indication of clinical outcome than staging alone and help better select therapeutic options in CC patients."}

Patients in the LPLD group with stage III lower rectal cancer had a locoregional recurrence rate 2.2-fold greater than those in the postoperative CRT group (16.7% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.044). Multivariate analysis showed that APR and advanced T-category (T4) were significantly associated with locoregional recurrence, whereas lymph node metastases, high preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen, and APR were significantly associated with shortening of disease-free survival. Postoperative-CRT and LPLD following TME resulted in comparable survival rates, but the locoregional recurrence rate was higher in the LPLD group.

Patients under observation may be referred for imaging either because regular imaging forms part of the surveillance strategy, or because tumour relapse is suggested by the development of new symptoms or a rise in tumour markers. This paper reviews the use of new and existing imaging techniques during surveillance following resection of primary colorectal cancer. The use of imaging for this surveillance is an application of cancer imaging that is supported by evidence-based clinical guidelines. Computed tomography provides the mainstay modality on grounds of good overall diagnostic performance combined with high availability and low cost. Improvements in survival with more aggressive follow up and treatment are likely to demand more accurate imaging techniques in the future."}

Surgery is the treatment of choice in patients with colorectal liver metastases. However, only 10% to 20% of these cases are resectable. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may allow surgery in patients with tumors initially considered unresectable. The aim of this study was to compare the results of liver resection due to colorectal liver metastases in patients with and without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We studied 105 patients who underwent surgery for liver metastases from colorectal cancer. The patients were divided into two groups according to treatment: surgery in patients with initially resectable tumors (group 1) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery (group 2) in patients with initially irresectable tumors, who were considered for surgery after response to chemotherapy. Age, sex, origin of primary tumor, time of presentation, number, maximum size and location of metastases, CEA, resection margin, postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay, recurrence rate, survival and disease-free survival were compared between the 2 groups of patients. When group 1 was compared with group 2, statistically significant differences were observed in synchronicity (30.8% vs 77.4%), bilobarity (13.5% vs 58.5%), number and size of metastases (1 vs 3 nodules and 4 cm vs 2 cm), resectability rate (96.1% vs 81.1%), disease-free interval (25 vs 11 months) and long-term survival at 1, 3 and 5 years (93%, 67% and 36% vs 78%, 26% and 12%). However, no statistically significant differences were found in postoperative morbidity and mortality (28.8% and 0% in group 1 and 22.6% and 1.8% in group 2, respectively). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with greater postoperative morbidity and mortality after resection of colorectal liver metastases, but long-term survival was lower in the group of patients receiving this treatment modality than in those with tumors initially considered resectable."}

To assess factors affecting long-term survival of patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of colorectal hepatic metastases, with attention to evolving chemotherapy regimens. Prospective evaluation of 235 patients with colorectal metastases who were not candidates for resection and/or failed chemotherapy underwent laparoscopic RFA. Preoperative risk factors for survival and pre- and postoperative chemotherapy exposure were analyzed. Two hundred and thirty-four patients underwent 292 RFA sessions from 1997 to 2006, an average of 8 months after initiation of chemotherapy. Twenty-three percent had extrahepatic disease preoperatively. Patients averaged 2.8 lesions, with a dominant diameter of 3.9 cm. Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival was 24 months, with actual 3 and 5 years survival of 20.2% and 18.4%, respectively. Median survival was improved for patients with <or=3 versus >3 lesions (27 vs. 17 months, P=0.0018); dominant size<3 versus >3 cm (28 vs. 20 months, P=0.07); chorioembryonic antigen<200 versus >200 ng/mL (26 vs. 16 months, P=0.003). Presence of extrahepatic disease (P=0.34) or type of pre/postoperative chemotherapy (5-FU-leucovorin vs. FOLFOX/FOLFIRI vs. bevacizumab) (P=0.11) did not alter median survival. To our knowledge, this is both the largest and longest follow-up of RFA for colorectal metastases. The number and dominant size of metastases, and preoperative chorioembryonic antigen value are strong predictors of survival. Despite classic teaching, extrahepatic disease did not adversely affect survival. In this group of patients who failed chemotherapy, newer treatment regimens (pre- or postoperatively) had no survival benefit. The actual 5-year survival of 18.4% in these patients versus near zero survival for chemotherapy alone argues for a survival benefit of RFA."}

Serum levels of CEA and CA 19-9 were examined in 586 patients with colorectal cancer. Cut-off levels were calculated at reference value:<2.5 ng/mL (group A) versus >2.5 ng/mL (group B) for CEA and, <37 U/mL (group A) versus >37 U/mL (group B) for CA 19-9. According to tumor progression, each marker tended to show a higher level. Group A showed a significantly better prognosis than group B in both CEA and CA 19-9. In Dukes classification A, B and C, only CEA showed a better prognosis in group A than group B. At the time of recurrence compared to the pre-operative point, the CEA and CA 19-9 levels were significantly higher in both group A and B, however. In relation to the necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU containing regimen) in Dukes A, the cases without adjuvant chemotherapy in group B of CEA showed a poor prognosis. The measurement of preoperative serum CEA and CA 19-9 is useful for prognostic prediction in colorectal cancer. Cut-off levels calculated at the reference value reflect the prognosis in this study. Especially, preoperative CEA reveals a potential high risk group in Dukes A which should be carefully treated by adjuvant chemotherapy to avoid recurrence."}

We present 9 consult cases, the largest series to date, of colorectal adenocarcinoma involving the prostate. Mean age of patients at diagnosis was 61 years (range, 42-78 years). Six cases were initially diagnosed on needle biopsy and the others by transurethral resection. Three cases were diagnosed before biopsy of the colon, which led to the discovery of a primary colonic tumor. The mean interval between the detection of the primary colonic tumor and prostatic involvement in the other 6 cases was 30 months (range, 1-52 months). At diagnosis, the stages of colorectal carcinomas were pT1 (n=2), pT2 (n=2), pT3 (n=2), and pT4 (n=3). Two cases involved the prostate after the recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma at the anastomotic site of the previous colonic resection. In most cases, the tumors were typical moderately differentiated with occasional poorly differentiated foci. Other histologic features included desmoplastic stromal reaction (100%, n=9), necrosis (77.8%, n=7), chronic inflammatory response (77.8%, n=7), cribriform pattern (66.7%, n=6), villous architecture (22.2%, n=2), mucin production (22.2%, n=2), signet-ring cells (11.1%, n=1), and perineural invasion (11.1%, n=1). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for beta-catenin in 6 of 6 cases, CDX2 in 6 of 6 cases, carcinoembryonic antigen in 7 of 7 cases, CK20 in 5 of 6 cases, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin in 5 of 6 cases, and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase in 3 of 6 cases. Stains were negative in all cases for prostate-specific antigen, P501S (prostein), and CK7. Six patients (66.7%) died of disease within an average of 34 months (range, 8-88 months) after diagnosis of prostatic involvement. There are critical therapeutic and prognostic implications for distinguishing between prostatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal carcinoma involving the prostate. Colorectal adenocarcinoma should be considered on prostate sampling when carcinoma exhibits either \"dirty\" necrosis, tall columnar epithelium with mucin production, mucin-positive signet-ring cells, villous architecture, or associated inflammation. Immunohistochemical stains for beta-catenin, CDX2, carcinoembryonic antigen, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, prostate-specific antigen, P501S (prostein), CK20, and CK7 can be helpful in making a definitive diagnosis."}

Fibrous tissue around a locally recurrent rectal tumour is an interesting histological feature, but its clinicopathological significance has not been investigated. This retrospective study examined clinicopathological findings in 48 patients who underwent curative total pelvic exenteration with distal sacrectomy (TPES) between 1992 and 2004. Data were analysed with respect to fibrosis around the recurrent tumour, categorized into one of three groups: no fibrosis (f0), partial fibrosis (f1) or circumferential fibrosis (f2). Ten, 17 and 21 patients had f0, f1 and f2 fibrosis respectively, with 5-year survival of none, four and eight patients respectively. The overall survival of patients with circumferential fibrosis was significantly better than that in patients with no fibrosis (P = 0.003). Univariable analysis showed that a high level of sacrectomy (P = 0.036), absence of lymphatic invasion (P = 0.031) and circumferential fibrosis (P = 0.039) were significantly associated with better overall survival. In multivariable analysis, circumferential fibrosis (P = 0.031) and low serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (P = 0.044) were independent factors for a favourable outcome. The outcome of patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer after curative TPES appears to be better when circumferential fibrosis is present around the tumour."}

Our aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and to discuss possible indications. After treating a series of adult patients, HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis from a signet cell carcinoma of the colon was performed intraoperatively in a 12-year-old boy. We gave mitomycin C at a dose of 30 mg/m2 over 90 minutes at maximum temperature of 41.2 degrees C. We performed intraoperative drug level monitoring and daily postoperative liver and kidney function tests and differential blood counts. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion was performed according to protocol without complications. Perfusate and venous drug levels were similar to those in an adult case. The patient had an uneventful recovery, and serum chemistry and blood count returned to normal after a week. The boy lived for 36 months after initial presentation. Sixteen months after HIPEC, still with excellent quality of life, an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) indicated recurrence. Thirty months after HIPEC, he died of progressive recurrent disease. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion as performed in adults may be beneficial to children with peritoneal carcinomatosis and merits further study."}

Peritoneal washes were obtained from 161 patients with colorectal cancer during laparotomy. CEA mRNA and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) mRNA levels of peritoneal washes were detected using the TRC method. Genetic detection in the CEA mRNA of peritoneal washes by TRC showed a significant correlation to the depth of invasion, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, peritoneal dissemination and stage. The overall survival and peritoneal recurrence-free survival rates of CEA mRNA-positive patients were significantly poorer than those of marker gene-negative patients. CEA mRNA levels in peritoneal washes were a significant independent prognostic factor for overall survival and peritoneal recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the detection of CEA mRNA in peritoneal washings by TRC is a useful, rapid genetic diagnosis for the prediction of peritoneal recurrence and survival in patients with colorectal cancer."}

Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy often requiring adjuvant chemotherapy. Familial Mediterranean Fever is a chronic hereditary disease which is relatively prevalent in the Middle East and is associated with recurrent episodes of serosal, synovial or cutaneous inflammations. The aim of this paper was to describe a patient with Familial Mediterranean Fever who received fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. A 56-year-old man with Familial Mediterranean Fever and amyloidosis was referred for evaluation and treatment following surgery for colorectal cancer. In light of his relatively young age, good general state of health and apparently well-controlled Familial Mediterranean Fever, he was treated with chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. The patient's clinical course during chemotherapy was unremarkable except for one minor attack of Familial Mediterranean Fever. The patient's follow-up was notable for periodic fluctuations in serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, up to 4-fold of normal. The Familial Mediterranean Fever remained stable. Although our patient showed a good tolerability of treatment, the administration of chemotherapy to patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever raises several concerns. These include a potential deterioration in the Familial Mediterranean Fever status owing to chemotherapy-induced stress, the potential effect of Familial Mediterranean Fever or its treatment on the tolerability of chemotherapy and an overlapping toxicity of the drugs used to treat the two diseases. An increase in serum carcinoembryonic antigen in this setting may be related to the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of Familial Mediterranean Fever but does not necessarily indicate disease recurrence. Clinicians should be aware of these issues considering the recent worldwide increase in colorectal cancer."}

Radiofrequency is a safe and effective minimally invasive procedure in the treatment of liver and other organs neoplastic lesions. Percutaneous access of neoplastic liver tissue is the most common access and electrodes are placed with imaging guidance into the tumour to be ablated. Complications during and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are of major or minor severity. Tumour dissemination related to the percutaneous access seems to be very unusual. Herein, we present a rare case of thoracoabdominal tumour wall dissemination after RFA of a recurrent hepatic colorectal metastasis previously removed by surgery. A 64-year-old man with a recurrent hepatic metastatic lesion was treated with internally cooled radiofrequency (RF) for ablation of a 3x3 cm in size tumour mass. Two sessions of RFA in one-month period were performed. Computed tomography (CT) of the upper abdomen and carcinoembryonic (CEA) antigen were used for estimation of the disease progression in the patient's follow-up. Ten months after RFA the patient presented abdominal pain and a mass appeared on the right thoracoabdominal area with simultaneous lung metastases. In conclusion, a large size, bulky and superficial mass on the liver parenchyma adjacent to the thoracoabdominal wall as well as multiple RFA sessions, seem to represent risk factors for tumour dissemination through the needle electrode used during the RFA procedure in hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer."}

The authors present a statistical analysis of the dynamics of tumour markers and compare these with single serum levels in patients before and after liver surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CLM). The serum levels of tumor markers conventionally used in clinical practice (CA19-9, CEA, CA72-4) and markers informing of the proliferation activity of malignancy (TKI TPA, TPS) were statistically analysed. The authors studied 144 patients who underwent liver surgery for colorectal liver metastases between September 1999 and June 2005. Serum levels of tumor markers before surgery (maximally two weeks before the operation), after surgery (maximally one month after the operation - usually on the day of dismission), six months (+/- one month) and twelve months after the surgery (+/- one month) were determined. The Log Rank test and the Wilcoxon test were used for statistical evaluation. The survival rate and disease-free intervals (DFI) were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The statistical analysis of tumour marker dynamic after liver surgery (speed and power of recurrence) supported the dynamics of CA 19-9 and CEA as excellent prognostic factors of early recurrence of CLM in contrast to proliferative tumor markers. The results of the study suggest the importance of tumour markers for the prediction of a short survival rate or DFI. This approach would be very helpful for the planning of palliative oncological treatment for patients with liver malignancies that cannot be treated by surgical therapy. Current patients with a high tendency of recurrence of CLM after liver surgery should be followed up more thoroughly to increase the possibility of successful reoperation."}

Patients underwent surgery 6th week after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. Biopsies of rectal carcinoma were taken before starting therapy and 14 days after its cesation. Biopsies were examined for TS, DPD and TP mRNA levels. CEA in serum was examined to monitor relapses. Both TP and TS mRNA increase two weeks after starting therapy (p<0,001). TP mRNA median levels were elevated 2,3x after starting therapy. Moreover responders exhibit 1,5x higher induction than non-responders both before and after starting therapy, but difference is significant before therapy only (p=0,017). Non-responders have most frequent TS induction. Complete remission was observed in 17% and substantial responses with microscopic residuum only in additional 19% of cases were achieved. The pathologic downstaging rate was 76%. Our data show that TS and TP mRNA are induced by preoperative chemoradiotherapy in both responders and nonresponders. TP induction is in accordance with the expected role of TP in the activation of capecitabine and the known promoting role of TP in tissue fibrosis frequently associated with tumor regression."}

A patient, 67-year old, was admitted to the Clinic due to a constipation over the last several months, increasing abdominal pain mainly localized in the left lower quadrant accompanied by nausea, vomiting and abdominal distension. Physical examination was unremarkable and the results of the detailed laboratory tests and carcinoembryonic antigen remained within normal limits. Colonoscopy revealed a large 10 cm long, and 4 to 5 cm in diameter, mobile lesion in his sigmoid colon. Conventional endoscopic ultrasound revealed 5 cm hyperechoic lesion of the colonic wall. Twenty MHz mini-probe examination showed that lesion was limited to the submucosa. Since polyp appeared too large for a single transaction, it was removed piecemeal. Once the largest portion of the polyp has been resected, it was relatively easy to place the opened snare loop around portions of the residual polyp. Endoscopic resection was carried out safely without complications. Histological examination revealed the common typical histological features of lipoma elsewhere. The patient remained stable and eventually discharged home. Four weeks later he suffered no recurrent symptoms. Colonic lipomas can be endoscopically removed safely eliminating unnecessary surgery."}

Twenty-one patients (12 females, 9 males) with a mean age of 54 years (range 31-78) were enrolled. Patients were suspected to have recurrent CRC by elevated CEA (n = 11), suspicious CT findings (n = 1), and clinically suspicious findings (n = 9). Preoperative FDG-PET scan and intraoperative GP study were performed in all patients. Mean time interval between preoperative FDG-PET scan and surgery was 16 days (range 1-41 days) in 19 patients. For intraoperative GP studies, 19 patients were injected with a dose of 10-15 mCi 18F FDG at approximately 30 minutes before the planned surgery time. In two patients, the intraoperative GP study was performed immediately after preoperative FDG-PET scan. Preoperative FDG-PET and intraoperative GP detected 48 and 45 lesions, respectively. A total of 50 presumed site of recurrent disease from 20 patients were resected. Thirty-seven of 50 presumed sites of recurrent disease were histological-proven tumor positive and 13 of 50 presumed sites of recurrent disease were histological-proven tumor negative. When correlated with final histopathology, the number of true positive lesions and false positive lesions by preoperative FDG-PET and intraoperative GP were 31/9 and 35/8, respectively. Both preoperative FDG-PET and intraoperative GP were true positive in 29 lesions. Intraoperative GP detected additional small lesions in the omentum and pelvis which were not seen on preoperative FDG-PET scan. FDG-PET scan demonstrated additional liver metastases which were not detected by intraoperative GP. Preoperative FDG-PET detected distant metastasis in the lung in one patient. The estimated radiation dose received by a surgeon during a single 18F FDG GP surgery was below the occupational limit. The combined use of preoperative FDG-PET and intraoperative GP is potentially helpful to the surgeon as a roadmap for accurately locating and determining the extent of tumor recurrence in patients with CRC. While intraoperative GP appears to be more sensitive in detecting the extent of abdominal and pelvic recurrence, preoperative FDG-PET appears to be more sensitive in detecting liver metastases. FDG-PET is also a valuable method in detecting distant metastases."}

Questions related to actual follow-up protocol, opinion about serum CEA monitoring, liver and/or lung metastasectomy, and motivation to participate in a new trial concerning follow-up. For the majority of surgeons the length of follow-up was influenced by age of the patient (62%) and physical condition (76%) prohibiting hepatic metastasectomy. The generally accepted follow-up protocol consisted of CEA measurements every 3 months in the first year and six-monthly thereafter, and ultrasound examination of the liver every 6 months. Nearly all surgeons (92%) were willing to participate in a new study of follow-up protocol. The adherence to national guidelines for the follow-up of colorectal carcinoma is low. The indistinctness about follow-up after curative treatment of colorectal carcinoma also affects clinical practice. Recent advancements in imaging techniques, liver and lung surgery have changed circumstances, which are not yet anticipated upon in current guidelines. Renewal of follow-up based upon scientific evidence is required."}

Between January 1990 and January 2005, 23 patients underwent 29 operations for resection of lung metastases. Median age was 68 years (range: 46-80 years). Median follow-up was 30 months (range: 12-149 months). The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 64 and 26%, respectively. Of the 23 patients, 16 patients had a solitary lesion, and seven patients had multiple lesions. The 5-year survival rates were 23 and 33%, respectively (not significant). The median disease-free interval (DFI)--the interval between colon resection and the appearance of lung metastases--was 43 months (1-168). Ten patients had DFIs <36 months, and 13 patients had DFIs >36 months. The 3-year survival rates were 20 and 38%, respectively (not significant). Recurrence of lung metastases was diagnosed in seven patients; three patients underwent second resections. They are alive today, with a median follow-up of 18 months. Patients who did not undergo second resections had a median survival of 12 months. Pulmonary resection for metastases from colorectal cancer does produce longer survival, even in patients with multiple lesions and recurrent metastases."}

Circulating tumour cells (CTC) in the blood of cancer patients indicate disease progression. Their presence reflects a relapse or metastasising process since CTC survive only a short time in the circulation. Test systems developed by AdnaGen have been used for the sensitive and specific analysis of CTC. Case reports of 2 breast cancer patients demonstrate the successful detection of CTC for therapy monitoring purposes. The disappearance of CTC reflects therapy success. The patient that responded towards therapy was characterized by the disappearance of CTC from the first therapeutic unit (TU) onwards. In contrast, CTC remained detectable in the other patient during the whole therapy pointing to only limited therapeutic efficacy and a progressive disease. Furthermore, systematic changes in the expression profile of CTC in colorectal patients at different stages of disease could be observed. Whereas EGFR was expressed in 90% of the patients with CTC during primary disease the expression level decreased to 15% in CTC of metastatic patients. On the other hand the expression of CEA was low in CTC found after primary surgery (15%) and dominant in CTC of metastatic patients (80%). The analysis of CTC is a useful tool for therapy monitoring of breast cancer and colorectal cancer patients in the adjuvant and palliative situation. The molecular profiling of CTC may be used to identify therapeutic targets such as HER2 or EGFR for personalised treatment that is likely to have an important impact on the therapeutic efficacy of drugs like Herceptin or Erbitux."}

The clinical data of 363 patients with LMCC were retrospectively reviewed with focus on the correlation between different therapy and survival. Of these 363 patients, 160 had SLM and 203 had MLM. Between the SLM and MLM group, there was no significant difference in age, or gender or primary cancer site (P > 0. 05 ), but significant differences were observed in condition of liver metastasis including liver lobe involved, focus number, maximum focus diameters and level of serum CEA and CA199 before therapy(P <0. 05). Ninety-one patients underwent curative hepatic resection, 22 of them in the SLM group and 69 in the MLM group. Mortality rate related to operation was 4. 5% (1/22) in SLM group and 2. 9% (2/69) in MLM group( P < 0.05). All patients were followed until 31/6/2005.

We analysed whether a rise in CEA > 1 ng/ml correlated with recurrence of metastases. Forty-six of 139 patients in final analysis had recurrent disease. A rise in CEA > 1 had a predictive value of 74% for recurrence or metastases (sensitivity 80%, specificity 86%). These findings were similar whether or not the CEA was normal preoperatively. If CEA is measured after surgery for colorectal cancer, a rise of >1 in the patient's postoperative value is predictive for recurrence or metastases with an overall sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 86%.

Resection of LM from colorectal cancer is the standard of care in this setting, yet two thirds will eventually relapse, and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy has failed to improve survival. Twenty-three patients who underwent R0 resection for LM of colorectal cancer received a dose of 40 to 60 mCi/m(2) (131)I-labetuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against carcinoembryonic antigen. Safety (n = 23), disease-free survival, and overall survival (n = 19) were analyzed, and efficacy was then compared retrospectively with a similar contemporaneous group of control patients (n = 19) treated at the same institution during the same time period but without RAIT. At a median follow-up of 91 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.0 months to infinity), the median overall survival for RAIT patients was 58.0 months (95% CI, 55.0 months to infinity), versus 31.0 months (95% CI, 26.0 months to infinity) at a 51-month median follow-up for the controls (P = .032).

This study included a total of 352 patients who were confirmed as having recurrence after curative resection for colorectal cancer during the period from January 1995 to December 2000. Of the 352 patients, 231 had early recurrence (less than 2 years after operation), 103 had intermediate recurrence (2-5 years after operation), and 18 had late recurrence (more than 5 years after operation). The clinicopathologic findings of the patients with late recurrence were compared with those of the other two recurrence groups, with special reference to the pattern of recurrence. The rate of late recurrence was 1.2 percent. In the late recurrence group, males outnumbered females by a ratio of 3.5:1 and the mean level of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen was 4.5 ng/ml, whereas that of the early recurrence group was 30.5 ng/ml. All the lesions in the cases with late recurrence except one lesion were located in the left colon or rectum, the tumors were small-sized and polypoid, and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas were more frequently observed. Distant metastasis, especially lung metastasis, was most frequently observed. Late recurrent colorectal cancer has some characteristics compared with early or intermediate recurrence. Although recurrence at more than five years postoperatively is not common, its possibility should be considered whenever performing follow-up, and surveillance for lung metastasis is recommended after more than five years of surgery."}

We aimed to review PET scans of patients with clinically and/or radiologically suspicious tumor recurrence but normal CEA. A retrospective review of an electronic database of 308 patients with CRC who had PET scans was performed. Only PET studies of patients with normal CEAs and suspected tumor recurrence who had pathological verification were selected for further analysis. Thirty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. PET was positive in 26 patients (67%) and normal in 13 (33%). Histopathologic evidence of tumor recurrence was seen in 27 of the 39 patients (69%). When correlated with histopathology, PET was true positive in 22 patients, false positive in 4, true negative in 8 and false negative in 5. Overall, the accuracy of PET was 76.9%, negative predictive value (NPV) was 61.5%, and positive predictive value (PPV) was 84.6%. PPV value of PET for liver metastases was 88.8% compared to 73.3% for local recurrence. In two patients with confirmed recurrence, CEA became positive 2 months after PET scan indicating earlier detection of disease with PET. The false positive PET findings were mainly in the bowel and were secondary to acute/chronic inflammation and granulation tissue. In 3 patients with false negative PET, histopathology was consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma. PET yields high PPV for recurrent CRC, particularly for liver metastases, in spite of normal CEA levels and should be considered early in the evaluation of patients with suspected tumor recurrence."}

For patients with stage II or stage III CRC who may be candidates for either liver resection or systemic treatment should recurrence develop, CEA should be measured every 2-3 months for at least 3 years after diagnosis. Insufficient evidence exists to recommend routine use of tissue factors such as thymidylate synthase, microsatellite instability (MSI), p53, K-ras and deleted in colon cancer (DCC) for either determining prognosis or predicting response to therapy in patients with CRC.

Seventy-two patients had T1 cancers (rectal cancer n = 44; colon cancer n = 28; p = 0.89) and 193 patients suffered from T2 cancer (rectal n = 120; colon cancer n = 73). The overall incidence of lymph node metastasis was 12.7% (5.6% for T1 cancer and 14.5% for T2 cancer; p = 0.021). The presence of lymphovascular permeation was the only independent factor associated with a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis on multivariate analysis (odds ratio: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.44-13.47, p = 0.009). There were no significant differences in disease-free 5-year survival (T1 = 84.6%; T2 = 81.1%) and 5-year cancer-specific survival in patients with T1 and T2 tumors (T1 = 90.2%; T2 = 90.6%). Patients with lymph node metastasis had a significantly shorter disease-free 5-year survival (p < 0.001) and 5-year cancer-specific survival (p = 0.002) when compared with those having a negative lymph node status.

Peritoneal recurrence has a much lower incidence in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients than gastric cancer (GC) patients. The aim of this study is to clarify the reason for the rare peritoneal recurrence in CRC as compared with GC. The incidence and the abundance of free tumor cells in the peritoneal lavages from 102 CRC and 126 GC patients who underwent curative surgery were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) as genetic markers. Prognostic significance of CEA and CK20 mRNA was also compared between CRC and GC after 2 years of follow-up by Kaplan-Meyer method with overall and peritoneal recurrence-free survival as endpoints. Positivity rate and average values of CEA and CK20 mRNA in peritoneal lavages of CRC patients, which are correlated to the depth of tumor invasion (pT category), were essentially the same as those of GC cases. Overall survival was significantly (marginally) worse in CEA mRNA (CK20 mRNA)-positive CRC patients than negatives like GC. However, peritoneal recurrence-free survival was not different between CEA (CK20) mRNA-positive and -negative CRC patients, in quite contrast to GC cases. Multivariate analysis showed that CEA mRNA was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients, but not in CRC patients. These results suggest that the rare peritoneal recurrence in CRC patients is not due to the low incidence or the small number of intraperitoneal free cancer cells, but more likely reflects due to the low-peritoneal metastatic potential of CRC cells."}

Until recently, no well accepted staging systems existed to categorize these patients with liver metastases, who have greatly varied prognoses. All liver resections from an American and from a European tertiary care center performed between 1991 and 1998 were assembled from two prospective databases. Of 792 liver resections, the 518 patients treated with no chemotherapy (379 American, 139 European) were compared with 274 patients treated (240 American, 34 European) with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients treated by all other treatment regimens, including regional chemotherapy, were excluded, as were patients who died perioperatively. Patient survival analysis was performed by log-rank, with stratification by the clinical risk score (CRS, a staging system grading risk of recurrence by five clinical parameters: node-positive primary, short disease-free interval, large (> 5 cm) liver tumor, multiple liver tumors, and high carcinoembryonic antigen). Patients subjected to adjuvant chemotherapy had improved survival (p=0.007, log-rank test) even after stratification by clinical risk score (p=0.001, stratified log-rank test). In every clinical risk score category, patients subjected to adjuvant chemotherapy had a higher chance of survival (range 1.3 to 2.0 times).

Five factors were independently associated with an improved survival: absence of extrahepatic disease at diagnosis, well- or moderately-differentiated colorectal cancer, largest lesion size being 4 cm or less, a postoperative CEA of 5 ng/ml or less and absence of liver recurrence. Long-term survival results of resection combined with cryotherapy for multiple bilobar CRLM are comparable to that of resection alone in selected patients."}

Median preoperative peripheral blood leukocyte subset counts were as follows: neutrophils 3148/mm3; lymphocytes 1574/mm3; monocytes 380/mm3. Univariate analysis indicated significantly worse 5-year cancer-related survival for patients with a peripheral blood monocyte count >300/mm3 (67.5%) than for patients with a count <or=300/mm3 (36.8%). Multivariate analysis showed a preoperative peripheral blood monocyte count >300/mm3 and preoperative CEA level (>10 ng/ml) to be independent predictive factors for cancer-related survival after hepatic resection. The preoperative peripheral monocyte count correlated positively with white blood cell and neutrophil counts, but not with the tumor number, interval between colorectal and hepatic surgery, or preoperative serum CEA level. Our findings indicate that a preoperative absolute peripheral blood monocyte count >300/mm3 is an independent predictive factor for cancer-related survival of patients with colorectal liver metastasis who have undergone hepatic resection."}

The purpose of this study was to compare rates and patterns of disease progression following percutaneous, image-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and nonanatomic wedge resection for solitary colorectal liver metastases. We identified 30 patients who underwent nonanatomic wedge resection for solitary liver metastases and 22 patients who underwent percutaneous RFA because of prior major hepatectomy (50%), major medical comorbidities (41%), or relative unresectability (9%). Serial imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed for evidence of local tumor progression. Patients in the RFA group were more likely to have undergone prior liver resection, to have a disease-free interval greater than 1 year, and to have had an abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level before treatment. Two-year local tumor progression-free survival (PFS) was 88% in the Wedge group and 41% in the RFA group. Two patients in the RFA group underwent re-ablation, and two patients underwent resection to improve the 2-year local tumor disease-free survival to 55%. Approximately 30% of patients in each group presented with distant metastasis as a component of their first recurrence. Median overall survival from the time of resection was 80 months in the Wedge group vs 31 months in the RFA group. However, overall survival from the time of treatment of the colorectal primary was not significantly different between the two groups. Local tumor progression is common after percutaneous RFA. Surgical resection remains the gold standard treatment for patients who are candidates for resection. For patients who are poor candidates for resection, RFA may help to manage local disease, but close follow-up and retreatment are necessary to achieve optimal results."}

Their pre- and postoperative serum CEA level was classified into two groups according to concentration: normal CEA (<5.0 ng/ml) and abnormal CEA (> or =5.0 ng/ml). Of all patients, abnormal pre- and postoperative serum CEA levels were observed in 181 (42.6%) and 48 (11.3%) patients, respectively. Abnormal preoperative serum CEA level was significantly correlated with the tumor located in the colon, the depth of tumor invasion, the status of lymph node metastasis, UICC stage, and the presence of postoperative relapse (p < 0.05). Concurrently, an abnormal postoperative serum CEA level was also prominently related to the above corresponding parameters (p < 0.05), except for the tumor location. Patients with a failed conversion of abnormal preoperative value to normal postoperative concentration were found to have the worst overall survival rate. Abnormal pre- and postoperative serum CEA levels were single independent predictors for survival and postoperative relapse, respectively. The identification of abnormal pre- and postoperative serum CEA levels may be useful in the auxiliary cancer prognosis or postoperative surveillance of CRC patients."}

Recurrence in the pelvis after resection of a rectal or rectosigmoid cancer presents a dilemma. Resection offers the only reasonable probability for cure, but at the cost of perioperative morbidity and potential mortality. Clinical decision making remains difficult. Patients resected with curative intent for isolated pelvic recurrences after curative colorectal surgery from 1988 through 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical and pathologic factors, salvage operations, and complications were recorded. The primary measured outcome was overall survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors of improved outcome. Ninety patients underwent an attempt at curative resection of a pelvic recurrence with median follow-up of 31 months. Complications occurred in 53% of patients. Operative mortality was 4.4% (4 of 90). Median overall survival was 38 months, and estimated 5-year survival was 40%. A total of 51 of 86 patients had known recurrences (15 local, 16 distant, 20 both). Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level and final margin status were statistically significant predictors of outcome. The resection of pelvic recurrences after colorectal surgery for cancer can be performed with low mortality and good long-term outcome; however, morbidity from such procedures is high. Low preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and negative margin of resection predict improved survival."}

Following resection of hepatic colorectal metastases, there are few criteria for predicting which patients have more aggressive disease and are, therefore, more likely to experience recurrence and reduced survival. Traditionally, primary tumor stage, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, time from primary tumor treatment to diagnosis of hepatic metastases (disease-free interval), hepatic tumor size, number of hepatic metastases, and presence of extrahepatic disease have been reported to be predictors of survival after resection. However, the data regarding the prognostic importance of these clinicopathologic factors are inconsistent and conflicting. Therefore, conventional clinicopathologic factors may be inadequate for the purposes of prognostication. More recently, there has been increased interest in identifying biologic indicators that may help better define patients at risk for recurrence after hepatic resection for colorectal metastases. Recent studies have shown that proliferation markers such as p53 expression, tritiated thymidine uptake, thymidylate synthase, Ki-67, and human telomerase reverse transcriptase may be better predictors of outcome after resection of hepatic colorectal metastases. Moreover, tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy may also prove to be a useful predictor of outcome following liver resection for colorectal metastases."}

The expressions of receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells and E-cadherin were analyzed with special reference to prognosis in 105 patients with colorectal cancer. Receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells immunoreactivity was detected in the membrane and cytoplasm of tumor cells and considered to be positive in 48 patients (45.7 percent). The expression of receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0004), venous invasion (P = 0.0062), Dukes stages (P < 0.0001), and serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (P = 0.014). Furthermore, receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells expression was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis (P < 0.001), and multivariate analysis indicated that it was an independent prognostic indicator. The expression of receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells was more frequently found in tumors with reduced or abnormal expression of E-cadherin. The survival time of patients with reduced/abnormal E-cadherin expression was significantly shorter than that of patients with normal E-cadherin expression among patients with receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells expression (P = 0.0043) but did not differ for those without receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells expression (P = 0.17). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that reduced/abnormal expression of E-cadherin was an independent prognostic factor in patients with receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells expression but not in those without receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells expression. Receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells expression is significantly correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.

This membrane array method was evaluated as a potential diagnostic and postoperative surveillance tool. Membrane arrays consisting of a panel of mRNA markers that include human telomerase reverse transcriptase, cytokeratin-19, cytokeratin-20, and CEA mRNA were used to detect CTCs in the peripheral blood of 157 postoperative CRC patients with normal perioperative serum CEA levels and in 80 healthy individuals. Digoxigenin-labeled cDNA were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from the peripheral blood samples, which were then hybridized to the membrane array. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of membrane arrays for the detection of CTCs were then calculated. Using the four markers in combination, expression of any three markers or all the four markers in this panel was significantly correlated with the clinicopathologic characteristics, including depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, tumor-node-metastasis stage, and postoperative relapse (all P < 0.05). The interval between the detection of all four positive molecular markers and subsequent elevated CEA ranged from 3 to 8 months (median 6 months). The expression of all four mRNA markers was an independent predictor for postoperative relapse. CRC patients with all four mRNA markers expression showed a significantly poorer survival rate than those with less than four positive markers. The constructed membrane array method was helpful in the early prediction of postoperative relapse in CRC patients with normal perioperative serum CEA levels."}

Resection of locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) after curative resection represents a difficult problem and a surgical challenge. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of resecting the local recurrence of rectal cancer and to analyze factors that might predict curative resection and those that affect survival. A retrospective review was performed in 50 patients who underwent surgical exploration with intent to cure LRRC between April 1998 and April 2005. All of the patients had previously undergone resection of primary rectal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients' charts, operation and pathology reports were reviewed. Primary tumor and treatment details, hospital of initial treatment and TNM stage were registered. The following data were collected concerning the detection of the local recurrence; date of recurrence, symptoms at the time of presentation and diagnostic work-up. Perioperative complication and date of discharge were also gathered. The recurrent tumors were classified as not fixed (F0), fixed at one site (F1) and fixed to two or more sites (F2) according to the preoperative and peroperative findings. Microscopic involvement of surgical margins and localization of recurrence were noted based on pathology reports. The median time interval between resection of primary tumor and surgery for locally recurrent disease was 24 (4-113) months. In a statistical analysis, initial surgery, complaints of patients, increasing number of sites of the recurrent tumor fixation in the pelvis, location of the recurrent tumor were associated with curative surgery. Curative, negative resection margins were obtained in 24 (48%) of patients; in these patients a median survival of 28 months was achieved, compared to 12 months (p=0.01) in patients with either microscopic or gross residual disease. Primary operation and CEA level at recurrence were also found to be important factors associated with improved survival. There was no operative mortality and, the complication rate was 24%. This study demonstrated that many patients with LRRC can be resected with negative margins. The type of primary surgery, symptoms, location, and fixity of recurrent tumor are associated with the increased possibility of carrying out curative resection. Previous surgery and curative surgery are significant predictors of both disease-specific survival and overall survival."}

The purpose of this study was to identify the changes in the clinicopathological features and outcome of CRC over this period. Based on the computerized database of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, between January 1981 and December 2000, 5,474 CRC patients were identified and divided into 2 groups based on the date of treatment (1981-1990 and 1991-2000). The clinicopathological features, outcome, and prognostic factors were analyzed and compared. The age at onset of cancer was 61 years in the 1980s group and 66 years in the 1990s group. The frequency of rectal tumors decreased from 50% in the 1980s group to 44% in the 1990s group. Tumor, nodes, metastasis (TNM) stage distribution, surgical mortality, and anastomosis leakage were similar in the two groups. However, the 5-year overall survival rate was better in the 1990s group (56%) than that in the 1980s group (50%, P = 0.001).

Seventy-one patients with 155 unresectable colorectal lung metastases underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous RF ablation at four institutions. The maximum tumor size was 3 cm or less in 61 patients and 3.1-6.0 cm in 10 patients (range, 0.5-6.0 cm; mean, 2.4 cm +/- 1.3). A single tumor was treated in 35 patients and multiple tumors in 36 patients. Extrapulmonary metastases were found in 30 patients. Follow-up with serial CT and positron emission tomography scans was performed from 4 to 42 months after RF ablation (mean, 19 months). Primary end point in this study was patient survival, and secondary end points were evaluation of safety of lung RF ablation and intrapulmonary recurrence.

Gastrointestinal cancer tumour markers are valuable in the detection of recurrence following resection or in monitoring response to chemotherapy. CEA, CA19-9, CA-50 and CA72-4 are currently available but are nonspecific and have a low sensitivity. 'Tumour M2-pyruvate kinase' was described by Eigenbrodt around 1985. In cancers the active tetrameric form of the M2 isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase converted to an inactive dimeric form by direct interaction with oncoproteins to channel glucose carbons into DNA synthesis. This review summarizes the current knowledge of this unique tumour marker with regard to its biochemistry, assay and potential use as a diagnostic and screening tool in gastrointestinal cancer. A literature search was conducted for entries from 1980 to 2005 using PubMed and NeLH databases using tumour M2-pyruvate kinase, faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase, tumour metabolism, tumour markers and carcinoembryonic antigen as keywords. A total of 56 references relevant to tumour M2-pyruvate kinase were retrieved. Eighteen references were clinical studies involving plasma/faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase and gastrointestinal cancer. The remaining 38 references were clinical/nonclinical trials and reviews on tumour metabolism and plasma/faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase assay. Seven of the 18 clinical studies involved faecal M2-pyruvate kinase. Three of the 11 plasma tumour M2-pyruvate kinase studies were non-English language and were excluded. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value for plasma/serum tumour M2-pyruvate kinase in the detection of gastrointestinal cancer was determined for each of the remaining eight studies. Data for gastrointestinal cancer M2-pyruvate kinase were compared with other gastrointestinal cancer markers. Data from three of the eight studies using a diagnostic cut-off value of 15 U/ml for ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma tumour M2-pyruvate kinase were analysed together as a small meta-analysis. At a diagnostic cut-off value of 15 U/ml for tumour M2-pyruvate kinase in EDTA plasma the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value was 57.3, 89, 85.7 and 64.8%, respectively, for colorectal cancers, 62.1, 89, 88 and 64%, respectively, for gastric/oesophageal cancers and 72.5, 89, 58 and 94%, respectively, for pancreatic cancers. As a faecal marker for colorectal cancers, faecal tumour M2-pyruvate kinase has a sensitivity of 73-92% at a cut-off value of 4 U/ml as against 50% sensitivity for Guaiac faecal test. Circulating tumour M2-pyruvate kinase is more commonly elevated in oesophageal, gastric and colorectal cancer patients than conventional tumour markers. Faecal M2-pyruvate kinase is a sensitive marker of colorectal cancer. The clinical role of tumour M2-pyruvate kinase in gastrointestinal cancer management should be investigated in large-scale clinical trials."}

Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix protein forming various types of spliced variants. Low molecule variants are transiently present, but large spliced variants are predominantly overexpressed in proliferative processes or tumorigenesis in some varieties of cancer. However, the detection of the plasma level of large tenascin-C spliced variant (L-Tn-CSV) in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been clarified. This study was performed to validate elevated plasma L-Tn-CSV levels as a possible biomarker for CRC. Plasma samples were obtained before resection and from time to time postoperatively and stored at -80 degrees C until assay. Plasma L-Tn-CSV levels were evaluated in patients with primary (n = 162) and with recurrent (n = 20) CRC, including 48 healthy volunteers, measured by ELISA. The average plasma L-Tn-CSV concentrations of patients with primary CRC were 5,260 +/- 3,243.3 pg/ml and of patients with recurrent CRC 4,106 +/- 2,261.1 pg/ml, which were significantly elevated in comparison with those of healthy volunteers (2,364.3 +/- 7,49.6). The sensitivity for detecting CRC using plasma L-Tn-CSV was 56.6%, based on the mean +/- 2 SD of the concentrations of healthy controls (3,863.5), which was significantly higher than CEA (40.1%) and CA19-9 (23.6%). No obvious associations were evident between plasma L-Tn-CSV status and values of CEA and CA19-9 respectively. Statistically significant differences in plasma L-Tn-CSV were observed depending on tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. Negative conversions of plasma L-Tn-CSV levels 6 months after resection were significantly higher in the completely curative resection group than in the non-curative groups (P < 0.001). The plasma L-Tn-CSV may serve very well as a useful biomarker for tumor staging and postoperative monitoring of preoperatively positive CRC that is independent and exceeds conventional tumor markers."}

Serum CEA but not CA 19-9 or p53 was a significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival, along with UICC and T/N stage. When comparing elevated CEA, CA 19-9, and p53 serum levels with expression of the markers in the tumors, their overall expression was found to be 61.3% in the serum versus 93.5% in the tumor in analyzed patients (n = 116).

Overall increased p53, CEA, and CA 19-9 serum levels and their marker expression in the tumor may be used at the time of primary tumor removal for defining patients at risk for tumor recurrence."}

The aim of the study was to estimate the long-term results and the prognostic value of clinical and pathological factors following R0 anterior resection with total mesorectal excision (TME). Ninety-eight consecutive patients with histologically confirmed rectal cancer were studied prospectively with five-year follow-up. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between curves were tested by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 63.6%. Mean time of recurrence was 13.8 months (range 3-38). Local recurrence rate was 7.8% with the mean time of 12.7 months (range 3-25). In univariate analysis Dukes' stage (RFS for stage: A=93.2%; B=53.8%; C=26.3%) and preoperative CEA serum level (s-CEA) (for s-CEA<or=5 ng/ml RFS=93.8%; for s-CEA>5 ng/ml RFS=5.9%) significantly influenced survival (P<0.005 and P<0.00001). These parameters were also found to be independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (P<0.05 and P<0.00001). Survival was worse in older female patients with low-localised poorly differentiated tumors; however, those variables had not significant impact on prognosis. Neither symptom duration nor mucinous histology was significantly related to survival. Using TME technique a low local recurrence rate resulting in improved survival can be achieved. Apart from clinicopathological staging, elevated s-CEA can identify patients with poor prognosis. In addition to TME adjuvant therapy for this high-risk group should be considered."}

The significance of detection of circulating cancer cells in blood during surgery in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains controversial. Experimental study revealed that the cancer cells injected from the vein disappeared completely until 7 days. The aim of this study was to clarify that the detection of circulating cancer cells in blood taken later than 7 days after curative surgery may be a prognostic factor. Two hundred consecutive patients with CRC who underwent potentially curative surgery were the subjects. Peripheral blood was collected between 7 and 10 days after resection. Cancer cells were detected using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) messenger RNA (mRNA). The median follow-up period was 52 months (range: 34-69 months). The overall positive incidence of CEA mRNA was 22%. Detection of CEA mRNA was not significantly related to conventional clinicopathological findings. Recurrence has been confirmed in 55 patients (28%). The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with rectal cancer, deep penetration, lymph node metastasis, preoperative chemoradiotherapy and positive CEA mRNA. The CEA mRNA positive patients showed significantly poorer disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than the negative patients (DFS, P = 0.007; OS, P = 0.04). Multivariate analysis revealed that the positive expression of CEA mRNA (P < 0.01) as well as the tumor location and TNM stage classification was identified as the significant risk factors for recurrence. Detection of CEA mRNA expressing cells in peripheral blood 7 days after curative surgery is a novel independent factor predicting recurrence in patients with CRC."}

Recurrence in the pelvis after resection of a rectal or rectosigmoid cancer presents a dilemma. Resection offers the only reasonable probability for cure, but at the cost of marked perioperative morbidity and potential mortality. Clinical decision making remains difficult. Patients who underwent resection with curative intent for isolated pelvic recurrences after curative colorectal surgery from 1988 through 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical and pathological factors, salvage operations, and complications were recorded. The primary measured outcome was overall survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors of improved outcome. Ninety patients underwent an attempt at curative resection of a pelvic recurrence; median follow-up was 31 months. Complications occurred in 53% of patients. Operative mortality occurred in 4 (4.4%) of 90 patients. Median overall survival was 38 months, and estimated 5-year survival was 40%. A total of 51 of 86 patients had known recurrences (15 local, 16 distant, 20 both). Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level and final margin status were statistically significant predictors of outcome. The resection of pelvic recurrences after colorectal surgery for cancer can be performed with low mortality and good long-term outcome; however, morbidity from such procedures is high. Low preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and negative margin of resection predict improved survival."}

A retrospective study of CEA values in the TME trial. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a marker in the follow-up after curative resection of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is often omitted from follow-up despite guideline recommendations. One reason is the assumption that when a normal CEA value exists before curative resection of CRC, it will neither rise during follow-up. This study investigates this relationship. Data were derived from a study initiated to evaluate treatment regimes for rectal carcinoma (Dutch TME trial, n=1861) from which 954 were eligible for analysis. Recurrent disease occurred in 272 of these patients (29.5%). The pre-operative CEA value was compared to CEA values during follow-up, using threshold values of 2.5 and 5.0 ng/ml. Normal pre-operative CEA values were present in 63% (CEA<5.0) and 39% (CEA<2.5) of patients with recurrent disease. Patients with a normal pre-operative CEA and recurrent disease had elevated CEA values during follow-up in 41% (CEA<5.0), 50% (CEA<2.5) and in 60% with both threshold values when the last measurement was done within 3 months before recurrent disease was diagnosed. A normal pre-operative CEA is common in patients with rectal carcinoma. CEA does rise due to recurrent disease in at least 50% of patients with normal pre-operative values. Serial post-operative CEA testing cannot be discarded based on a normal pre-operative serum CEA."}

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become an important adjunct to modern liver surgery. However, scant knowledge on long-term outcome of RFA for colorectal liver metastasis is available, nowadays. This is a prospective clinical study of patients with liver metastasis of colorectal cancer who were treated by RFA between April 1, 1998, and November 30, 2004. Forty-seven patients with 147 liver metastases were treated with RFA in a total of 70 interventions. A metastasis resection was not feasible in 80% of the interventions. All the patients were followed up at regular intervals with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and laboratory tests including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). No RFA-related mortality occurred. The median follow-up time after the diagnosis of liver metastasis was 33 months. The RFA-related morbidity was 7%. After the RFA, the expected median overall survival rate is, to date, 39 months. Overall survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 88%, 80% and 57%, respectively. Local recurrence rates reached 8.8% overall and 1.6% for metastasis smaller than 3cm in diameter. No local recurrence occurred for metastasis smaller than 3cm in diameter if treated with the newest RFA device. Excellent local tumour control was achieved with radiofrequency ablation of small liver metastasis. The expected overall survival rate of patients with RFA for unresectable or non-resected colorectal liver metastasis improved in comparison with the survival rate reported following the natural course (best supportive care) or chemotherapy. The low local recurrence rate of metastases of less than 3cm challenges the results obtained by the more invasive treatment of conventional liver surgery."}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of serum c-erbB-2 monitoring in diagnostics and prediction of disease outcome in rectal cancer patients. Serum samples from 88 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma before surgery and from 41 healthy controls were tested for the presence of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein by ELISA, and the patients were followed up for at least 5 years after the surgery. Preoperative serum c-erbB-2 levels were significantly higher in stage IV patients than in healthy controls (P<0.001) and did not show correlation with preoperative CEA levels. Elevated preoperative serum c-erbB-2 levels showed relatively high specificity (88%) and low sensitivity (44%) in the diagnosis of rectal cancer. Elevated preoperative oncoprotein levels were predictive neither for overall survival nor for development of local recurrence/distant metastases. Although preoperative serum c-erbB-2 levels were significantly higher in rectal cancer patients than in healthy controls, the soluble c-erbB-2 does not seem to be useful in the diagnosis of rectal cancer due to its low sensitivity. Preoperative serum levels of this oncoprotein were predictive neither for overall survival nor for local recurrence/distant metastases in rectal cancer patients."}

Choosing the appropriate cut-off point is crucial to the diagnostic accuracy (DA) of continuous test variables. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis is the appropriate statistical method for this purpose, but has not been applied in previous studies. One hundred ninety-four consecutive patients surgically treated with curative intent for CRC between July 1996 and June 1999 had systematic follow-up for five years. Follow-up included imaging, coloscopy and serial CEA measurements. Complete data including CEA measurements were available from 153 patients. ROC analysis of CEA was done with regard to detection of recurrent disease. Depending on the chosen cut-off value of CEA, DA varied widely within the normal range (CEA <or=10 U/ml). CEA >4 U/ml provided the highest sensitivity (0.78) and specificity (0.91), compared to a sensitivity and specificity at the upper normal range (CEA = 10 U/ml) of 0.51 and 0.99, respectively. Thirty-three patients (24%) developed recurrence. Among 11 (5%) asymptomatic patients diagnosed by elevated CEA levels, only two patients (1.5%) were amenable to secondary curative surgery. A threefold increase of CEA in an individual patient had the same DA as the best cut-off value (>4 U/ml). Diagnostic accuracy of CEA in follow-up after curative surgery for CRC is influenced by the chosen cut-off value. A threefold increase of CEA may indicate recurrent disease. The value of serial measurement of CEA was limited."}

This study was designed to determine whether the vaccination of genetically modified dendritic cells (DCs) simultaneously expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) can overcome the peripheral T-cell tolerance to CEA and thereby elicit a therapeutic response in CEA transgenic mice. CEA transgenic mice were immunized once by subcutaneous injection with DCs adenovirally transduced with CEA and T helper-type 1 cytokine genes. The cytotoxic activity of spleen cells against CEA-expressing tumors, MC38-CEA, in the mice immunized with DCs expressing CEA (DC-AxCACEA) was higher than that in those immunized with DCs-AxCALacZ (p < 0.0001), and was augmented by the cotransduction with the GM-CSF/IL-12 gene (p < 0.05). The vaccination with DC-AxCACEA/GM-CSF/IL-12 could elicit a more potent therapeutic immunity than the vaccination with DC-AxCACEA in subcutaneous tumor models (p < 0.0001), and 4 of 5 mice showed a complete eradication of the subcutaneous tumors in these vaccination groups. Even in a large tumor model, this vaccination therapy completely eliminated the subcutaneous tumors in all mice. This antitumor activity mostly vanished with the depletion of CD8(+) T cells and NK cells in vivo and was completely abrogated with the depletion of CD4(+) T cells. A histopathological examination showed no evidence of an autoimmune reaction. No other adverse effects were observed. This vaccination strategy resulted in the generation of highly efficient therapeutic immune responses against MC38-CEA in the absence of autoimmune responses and demonstrated no adverse effects, and may therefore be useful for future clinical applications as a cancer vaccine therapy."}

Patterns of recurrence, method and timing of diagnosis and outcome were recorded. One hundred and ninety-one patients underwent potentially curative resection from 1989 to 2004 of whom 103 developed recurrence. The median (inter-quartile range) follow-up was 24.4 (6.5-42.3) months. The median (IQR) time to recurrence and overall survival was 25.0 (10 -not yet reached) and 45.2 (21-123) months, respectively. Seventeen patients (8.9%) underwent further surgery with curative intent. Fifty-five patients (57.9%) had recurrence diagnosed at routine follow-up with 71% (44/62) being diagnosed by CEA and CT. The CEA was elevated in 85.7% (72/84 patients) at the time of diagnosis of recurrence. Although the detection of recurrent disease is common during follow-up after hepatic resection for colorectal metastases, few patients will be suitable for further intervention with curative intent.

Cancer recurrence was assessed at follow-up, and the accuracy of RT-PCR and primary tumour lymph node positivity in predicting recurrence was estimated. One hundred and ninety-six patients with colorectal cancer were studied over a median follow-up of 1393 days from surgery. Regression analysis selected 24-h post-resection RT-PCR positivity (hazard ratio for a positive test in predicting recurrence 8.66 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 3.08 to 24.33)) before lymph node involvement (hazard ratio 7.92 (95 per cent c.i. 3.26 to 19.20)). When 24-h post-resection RT-PCR was combined with lymph node positivity, the hazard ratio increased to 18.54 (95 per cent c.i. 4.01 to 85.11), attributing a 3 per cent recurrence risk to 52 per cent, and a 50 per cent recurrence risk to 48 per cent, of patients with colorectal cancer resected with curative intent.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic role of matrix metalloproteinases in rectal cancer. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 94 rectal carcinomas were used for the immunohistochemical analysis of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, MMP-7, MT1-MMP, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2. Inclusion criteria were sporadic rectal adenocarcinoma resected curatively (including total mesorectal excision), adjuvant radiochemotherapy in UICC stages II and III, and complete intra-institutional follow-up. Results of immunohistochemistry were correlated with clinical and histopathologic data from the prospective rectal cancer registry and prognosis. End points of the prognostic analysis were tumor progression caused by local and/or distant recurrence and 5-year survival (disease-free and overall). To assess prognostic significance, statistics included univariate and multivariate analysis (p<0.05 statistically significant). Of the 94 rectal carcinomas, 35% (33/94) showed an epithelial MMP-2 expression, 77% (72/94) were MMP-2 positive in the stroma. Fifty-four percent (51/94) were MMP-7 positive, and 47% (46/94) were positive for both MT1-MMP and TIMP-2. The stromal MMP-2 staining pattern was correlated with the depth of invasion (pT status, p=0.006) with MMP-7 (p=0.016) and TIMP-2 expression (p=0.036). Positive expression of MMP-2 in tumor epithelium was correlated with MMP-7 (p=0.027), MT1-MMP (p=0.036), and TIMP-2 expression (p<0.0001). A positive staining pattern of MMP-7 was significantly correlated with depth of invasion and TIMP-2 (p<0.01). The positive staining pattern of MT1-MMP was correlated with epithelial MMP-2 (p=0.036), MMP-7 (p=0.004), and TIMP-2 expression (p=0.002). TIMP-2 immunoreactivity correlated with depth of invasion (p=0.013), epithelial MMP-2 (p<0.001), stromal MMP-2 (p=0.036), MMP-7 (p<0.001), and MT1-MMP (p=0.002). Neither pattern correlated with age, gender, tumor stage (UICC), grading, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, or nodal status (p>0.05). Within a mean follow-up of 46 months, tumor progression, caused by either local recurrence or distant metastasis, occurred in 14 patients (15.4%). There was no significant association between the MMP expression and the incidence of local and/or distant recurrence. In terms of survival, preoperative CEA level (disease-free 5-year survival 46% with increased CEA vs 70% with normal CEA, p=0.01; overall 5-year survival 43 vs 74%, p<0.01) and UICC stage were the only factors to be significantly related to 5-year survival by univariate analysis, whereas the metalloproteinases failed to show a significant association. In multivariate analysis, CEA and UICC stage were not identified as independent factors predictive of survival. MMP-2, MMP-7, MT1-MMP, and TIMP-2 do not appear to be significant predictors of prognosis in a homogenous collective of curatively resected rectal adenocarcinomas."}

Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a right adrenal mass and no other abnormality. The preoperative diagnosis was a solitary adrenal metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer; the lesion was removed in September 2002. On pathology, adrenal metastasis was confirmed. Although the patient's serum CEA normalized soon thereafter, 12 months after adrenalectomy, the CEA again increased; the patient had local recurrence of the resected adrenal lesion and liver metastasis. Therefore, the patient was given systemic chemotherapy, but his condition deteriorated, and he died 38 months after adrenalectomy. Adrenal metastasis from colorectal cancer is not unusual; however, a solitary metastasis is rarely found and resected surgically. As surgical treatment of the metastatic lesion could improve patients' prognosis to some extent if it is detected early, the possibility of adrenal metastasis should be kept in mind when colorectal cancer patients are followed."}

Quantitative evaluation of VEGF and CEA content was performed on protein extracts obtained from tissue biopsies from 69 CRC patients and 15 healthy donors. VEGF significantly correlated with CEA content of either tumor tissues (rho = 0.55, p < 0.0001) or corresponding normal mucosa (rho = 0.34, p < 0.005).

There were significant differences in the rates of three year survival between the curative surgery group and non surgery group, but there were no differences between the non curative surgery group and non-surgery group. A survival analysis showed that prognoses of patients ew (-) or CEA under 10 ng/ml group were statistically better than the other group. Thirty four patients underwent operation. The mean operation time and the mean blood loss were 334.2 minutes and 1977 ml, respectively. Eighteen patients had some complications associated with the operation.

Histologically, the tumor was considered to be stage IIIb (mp, n3(+), P0, H0, M(-)). She received adjuvant chemotherapy with 5'-DFUR. After 13 months from the surgery, the patient developed a hip pain. After 16 months from the surgery, a pelvic MRI scan revealed a 3 cm tumor in the perineum. Biopsy from the tumor revealed adenocarcinoma. Consequently, we diagnosed local recurrence in the perineum. Chemotherapy with CPT-11 (230 mg/body) and 5'-DFUR (800 mg/body) was administered for 2 cycles. Because the tumor was enlarged, high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy was given to the recurrent site at a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions/5 days. There were no severe complications.

High preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels have been well investigated and found to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it has been observed that the outcome varies after curative resection, along with postoperative serum CEA levels; some patients continue to have high postoperative serum CEA levels while postoperative CEA levels return to normal in others. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of postoperative serum CEA levels in CRC patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels. Between January 2002 and December 2004, 423 CRC patients underwent operation in our hospital; 181 (42.8%) had high preoperative serum CEA levels and were enrolled in this study. Among the 181 patients, 165 patients had curative resection; the remaining 16 had stage IV disease, so they underwent palliative surgery and were subsequently excluded from analysis. Pre- and postoperative serum CEA levels were measured and analyzed. All patients had curative resection and were divided into two groups according to postoperative serum CEA levels: one group comprised patients with postoperative serum CEA > or = 5 ng/mL (n = 80) and the other group comprised patients with postoperative serum CEA levels < 5 ng/mL (n = 85). Postoperative serum CEA levels were significantly related to location of primary tumors (p = 0.042), lymph node metastases (p = 0.009), TNM stage (p = 0.001), and postoperative relapse (p = 0.004). The results of multivariate analysis showed that both lymph node metastases and high postoperative serum CEA levels (> or = 5 ng/mL) were independent prognostic factors for CRC patients after curative resection. Postoperative serum CEA levels can be a single independent prognostic determinant in CRC patients with high preoperative serum CEA levels. Intensive follow-up and adjuvant therapy may be necessary in CRC patients who continue to have high postoperative serum CEA levels even after curative resection."}

Nowadays, FDG-PET plays a pivotal role in staging patients before surgical resection of recurrence and metastases, in the localization of recurrence in patients with an unexplained rise in serum carcinoembryonic antigen and in assessment of residual masses after treatment. In the presurgical evaluation, FDG-PET may be best used in conjunction with anatomic imaging in order to combine the benefits of both anatomical (CT) and functional (PET) information, which leads to significant improvements in preoperative liver staging and preoperative judgment on the feasibility of resection. Integration of FDG-PET into the management algorithm of these categories of patients alters and improves therapeutic management, reduces morbidity due to futile surgery, leads to substantial cost savings and probably also to a better patient outcome. FDG-PET also appears to have great potential in monitoring the success of local ablative therapies soon after intervention and in the prediction and evaluation of response to radiotherapy, systemic therapy, and combinations thereof. This review aims to outline the current and future role of FDG-PET in the field of colorectal cancer."}
{"id": "17114079", "title": "PET/CT: will it change the way that we use CT in cancer imaging?", "content": "PET/CT: will it change the way that we use CT in cancer imaging? Accurate staging of cancer is of fundamental importance to treatment selection and planning. Current staging paradigms focus, first, on a detailed delineation of the primary tumour in order to determine its suitability for resection, and, thereafter, on assessment of the presence of metastatic spread that would alter the surgical approach, or mandate non-surgical therapies. This approach has, at its core, the assumption that the best, and sometimes the only, way to cure a patient of cancer is by surgical resection. Unfortunately, all non-invasive techniques in current use have imperfect ability to identify those primary tumours that are able to be completely excised, and even worse ability to define the extent of metastatic spread. Nevertheless, because of relatively low cost and widespread availability, computed tomography (CT) scanning is the preferred methodology for tumour, nodal and systemic metastasis (TNM) staging. This is often supplemented by other tests that have improved performance in particular staging domains. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography, or endoscopic ultrasound may be used as complementary tests for T-staging; surgical nodal sampling for N-staging; and bone scanning, MRI or ultrasound for M-staging. Accordingly, many patients undergo a battery of investigations but, even then, are found to have been incorrectly staged based on subsequent outcomes. Even for those staged surgically, pathology can only identify metastases within the resection specimens and has no capability for detecting remote disease. As a result of this, many patients undergo futile operations for disease that could never have been cured by surgery. In the case of restaging, the situation is even worse. The sequelae of prior treatment can be difficult to differentiate from residual cancer and the likelihood of successful salvage therapy is even less than at presentation. More deleteriously, patients may be subjected to additional morbid treatments when cure has already been achieved. Thus, in post-treatment follow-up, the presence and extent of disease is equally critical to treatment selection and patient outcome as it is in primary staging. One of the major strengths of positron emission tomography (PET)/CT as a cancer staging modality is its ability to identify systemic metastases. At any phase of cancer evaluation, demonstration of systemic metastasis has profound therapeutic and prognostic implications. Only in the absence of systemic metastasis does nodal status become important, and only when unresectable nodal metastasis has been excluded does T-stage become important. There are now accumulating data that PET/CT could be used as the first, rather than the last test to assess M- and N-stage for evaluating cancers with an intermediate to high pre-test likelihood of metastatic disease based on poor long-term survival. In this scenario, there is great opportunity for subsequently selecting and tailoring the performance of anatomically based imaging modalities to define the structural relations of abnormalities identified by PET, when this information would be of relevance to management planning. Primary staging of oesophageal cancer and restaging of colorectal cancer are illustrative examples of a new paradigm for cancer imaging."}

Seventy-seven nonhospitalized MCRC patients received chronoIFLO every 3 weeks, with day 1: I (180 mg/m2 over 6 hours, with peak infusion rate at 05:00) and days 2-5: 5-FU/LV (700/300 mg/m2 per day over 12 hours, with peak flow rate at 04:00), and O (20 mg/m2 per day over 12 hours, with peak flow rate at 16:00). Toxicity and response were assessed every 3 weeks and every 2 months, respectively. RESULTS. Three or more prior chemotherapy lines were given to 75% of the patients. Two or more organs had metastatic disease in 65% of the patients. A median number of six courses of chronoIFLO was given. The main grade 3-4 toxicities were diarrhea (39% of the patients, 9% of the courses) and neutropenia (30% of the patients and 7% of the courses). Grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in 14% of the patients. Two patients achieved a partial response and 61 had stable disease, resulting in disease control for 82% of the patients. The median time to progression (TTP) was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval, 3.7-6.0). The median overall survival time was 14.2 months (9.8-17.3). Baseline performance status, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, and CEA doubling time were independent prognostic factors of TTP. ChronoIFLO safely and durably halted tumor progression in most extensively pretreated MCRC patients."}

Extracellular DNA in the plasma or serum of cancer patients has been recently proposed as a source of analyzable cancer-related gene sequences (qualitative approach). Furthermore, patients with different tumor types show high levels of cell-free circulating DNA both in plasma and serum (quantitative approach) at the time of surgery. Our aim was to verify whether the level of cell-free DNA in plasma might help in detecting recurrences during follow-up of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We studied 70 patients undergoing surgery for primary CRC. Plasma samples were obtained at the time of surgery and during follow-up. The cell-free circulating DNA in plasma was quantified by the Dipstick Kit method. At the time of surgery, in all patients, cell-free DNA levels in plasma were about 25 times higher in comparison with 20 healthy donors. In contrast, the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) value of this cohort of patients was altered in only about 37% of cases. During follow-up, cell-free DNA levels decreased progressively in tumor-free patients, while it increased in those developing recurrences or metastases. The results were further supported by qualitative analysis of circulating tumor-specific DNA, such as K-Ras mutations and p16(INK4a) promoter hypermethylation. These preliminary data confirm that plasma tumor DNA levels (i) are significantly higher in patients with CRC, (ii) decrease progressively in the follow-up period in tumor-free patients, and (iii) increase in patients with recurrence or metastasis. We suggest, therefore, that the quantification of plasma cell-free DNA might represent a useful tool for monitoring of CRC and, prospectively, for identifying high-risk individuals."}

She received bilateral salpingo-ophorecctomy for metastatic cancer in August 1999. Intravenous chemotherapy was resumed with weekly 5-FU and leucovorin intravenously in August 1999. CEA was 93.8 ng/microl in November 1999. Intravenous chemotherapy was discontinued after 20 doses and oral chemotherapy with futraful and leucovorin was started in January 2000. CEA was found to be 240.3 ng/microl in December 1999 and then elevated to 1521.3 ng/microl in June 2001, which was 10 months after resection of metastatic ovarian cancer. No metastatic lesions could be detected, however, with image studies. The CEA decreased to 396.6 ng/microl three months later. Futraful was switched to uracil-tegafur (UFUR) in September 2001. The CEA for the patient ranged from 68.5 to 298.9 ng/microl for the following 5 years without aggressive chemotherapy. No evidence of recurrence could be demonstrated by imaging studies. The patient is not a smoker and denied exposure to a smoking environment. She was also not known to have persistent infections, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, or any benign tumors. The current case suggested that: (i) elevation of CEA is not necessarily well correlated with presence of metastatic colon cancer; (ii) some patients may live with elevated CEA for years without evidence of recurrence or metastasis; (iii) aggressive chemotherapy may not be necessary in patients with only elevated CEA."}

As a mode of colorectal cancer recurrence, liver metastasis plays an important role. One of the factors reported to predict liver metastasis is the detection of trace amounts of tumor cells in the blood. For this purpose, cancer cell-induced cytokeratins (CKs) are generally identified, using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the present study, we aimed to detect trace amounts of tumor cells, based on CK20, in the circulating venous blood, and we examined pathological factors, liver metastasis, and prognosis. The subjects were 57 colorectal cancer patients who had undergone operation. We examined the cancer-induced marker (CK20) in circulating venous blood by RT-PCR and investigated the relationships between this marker, pathological factors, and prognosis. Detection ratio of CK20 mRNA was 42.1%, and CK20 was significantly correlated with the pathological factor of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.037). The 5-year survival rate for CK20-positive patients was 62.5% and that for the CK20-negative patients was 87.5%; there was a significant difference (P = 0.048) between the two groups. Recurrence was recognized in six patients; two were positive for CK20 and four were negative for CK20. These findings indicate that CK20 is strongly related to lymph node metastasis and prognosis, suggesting its usefulness for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer recurrence. However, CK20 did not predict liver metastasis."}

This study was designed to examine whether disseminated tumor cells in peripheral blood of locally advanced rectal cancer patients undergoing preoperative chemoradiation have the potential to serve as a marker for therapy response. Studies suggest that patients with advanced rectal cancer who respond to preoperative chemoradiation most likely benefit from this treatment. From advanced rectal cancer patients undergoing preoperative chemoradiation, peripheral blood was obtained at defined times: before, during, and after chemoradiation and during surgery. Patients were divided into histopathologic responders (ypT0-T2) and nonresponders (ypT3-T4). Cytokeratin 20 and carcinoembryonic antigen reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were performed to detect disseminated tumor cells. A blood sample was deemed positive for disseminated tumor cells if both carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin 20 were detected. The overall population (n = 26) showed a positivity rate of 32 percent for disseminated tumor cells before initiation of chemoradiation. Of the responders (n = 8), 63 percent were positive for disseminated tumor cells before chemoradiation, whereas only 18 percent of nonresponders (n = 18) were positive (P = 0.026). From initiation of chemoradiation to the end of surgery, a significant decrease was seen in tumor cell positivity in the blood of responders (P = 0.042). Moreover, the responders represented a trend toward a decrease in tumor cell positivity during chemoradiation (P = 0.079). In contrast, there were no noticeable alterations within the treatment course in nonresponders. This prospective proof of principle study demonstrates that locally advanced rectal cancer with preoperative chemoradiation shows different biologic behavior in terms of tumor cell dissemination in peripheral blood when therapy responders compared with nonresponders."}

The subjects were 73 patients who underwent curative surgery for colorectal cancer. The median serum, bile, and portal CEA levels were significantly lower in 5-year survivors than in patients in whom hepatic metastases or recurrent disease subsequently developed. The CEA level in portal blood and bile was a good indicator of hepatic metastases, with sensitivity of 92% and 100%, respectively. However, the accuracy of any CEA measurement for predicting hepatic metastases, local recurrence, or 5-year survival did not exceed 70%. None of these CEA measurements is accurate enough to be the basis of a management decision. Thus, we suggest that CEA measurement be used to assist in the prediction of a high risk of the development of hepatic secondaries and that these patients are followed up closely after curative resection."}

We evaluated the results of five years of actuarial survival data to determine whether serial monitoring of serum hepatocyte growth factor could provide prognostic information on these patients. Blood samples of 147 colorectal cancer patients were obtained and the serum concentration of hepatocyte growth factor was measured. Elevated serum hepatocyte growth factor levels were associated with stage progression. Although the overall positive rate of hepatocyte growth factor in the patients was the same as that of the carcinoembryonic antigen, the positive rate of hepatocyte growth factor in the Dukes A patients was two times higher than that of the carcinoembryonic antigen, and nearly 40 percent of the carcinoembryonic antigen-negative patients had a positive serum hepatocyte growth factor in the Dukes A and B classification. In this subgroup, patients with positive serum hepatocyte growth factor or carcinoembryonic antigen levels had a poorer prognosis, whereas positive serum hepatocyte growth factor level after surgery could predict disease recurrence. A combination of serum hepatocyte growth factor and carcinoembryonic antigen tests might be useful for selecting patients with aggressive diseases in Dukes A and B classification."}

Treatment of rectal cancer with neoadjuvant radiotherapy has been shown to reduce local recurrence and improve overall survival. The role of chemoradiotherapy in patients with T2, N0 and early T3, N0 rectal cancer, treated by radical surgery with total mesorectal excision, remains controversial. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of recurrence in this group of patients to enhance treatment selection. One hundred patients with primary T2-3, N0 adenocarcinoma of the rectum, uniformly treated by surgery alone, were studied. The pathology slides available for 97 patients were rereviewed. Three patients with incomplete data sets were excluded. Clinical and survival data were obtained from a prospective computerized database and updated from hospital and office charts. The study end points were disease-free survival, disease-specific survival (DSS), time to pelvic recurrence (PR), and distant recurrence. Complete follow-up was available for all study patients. Median follow-up was 79.5 months (range, 57.7 to 105.9 months). During this time period 30 patients (31.9%) died as a result of disease and 64 patients (68.1%) remained alive and disease free.

The aim of this study is to define the characteristics of those patients who are most likely to benefit from surgical resection. Fifty-eight patients who underwent pulmonary resection for colorectal metastases were retrospectively reviewed and examined for clinicopathological factors. Overall, 5-year survival rates were 29%, with a median survival time (MST) of 27 months. Multivariate analysis identified four factors that indicate independent and favourable prognostic impact: three or less tumours, metachronous metastasis, negative hilar and/or mediastinal lymph node metastasis and normal prethoracotomy serum carcinoembryonic antigen level. The 5-year survival rate for 16 patients who satisfied all of these favourable characteristics was 62% (MST = 86 months), which was significantly better than those patients lacking these characteristics. The 5-year survival rate for 13 patients who underwent repeated metastasectomy was 37% (MST = 32 months). The four factors selected in our multivariate analysis appear to be favourable factors for the practical identification of those patients who are most likely to benefit from surgical resection. Repeated pulmonary resection for lung-only recurrence may benefit carefully selected patients."}

This study was undertaken to evaluate long-term outcome of RFA in relation to its timing opposite chemotherapy, and to identify prognostic factors associated with survival. Patients undergoing RFA from 1997 to 2003 were monitored. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed. RFA was performed for 100 patients in 146 procedures to ablate 507 colorectal metastatic tumors. All patients were followed up for at least 18 months or until death, up to 84 months: the median follow-up was 24.5 months. The overall median survival was 28 months, and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 90.0%, 42.0%, and 30.5%, respectively. The recurrence-free median survival was 13 months. Median survival was 48 months among 55 patients (55%) who received RFA (first-line) before initiation of chemotherapy, versus 22 months among 45 patients (45%) who received RFA (second-line) for residual or progressive metastatic disease after chemotherapy. Significant factors affecting overall survival were carcinoembryonic antigen level (200 ng/mL), total tumor size (sum diameter of tumors, 100 mm), RFA approach, previous therapeutic chemotherapy by a univariate analysis, age (70 years) by a multivariate analysis, and extrahepatic metastasis by both analyses. RFA can contribute to encouraging long-term survival. Prognostic factors have been identified. Compared with historical survival, RFA appears to confer a survival benefit over systemic chemotherapy alone, particularly when it is offered as part of first-line therapy."}

Eighty-nine fully evaluable patients were followed up for three years postoperatively to monitor hepatic metastases. Preoperative blood CEA, lymph node metastases and biliary CEA were compared in order to assess which procedure was more efficient in identifying patients who would develop hepatic metastases. Eleven of the 89 evaluable patients developed hepatic metastases: 9/11 presented elevated biliary CEA levels (mean: 12.73; range: 5.1-26.2); 8/11 had high preoperative blood CEA values; and 9/11 were at anatomopathological stage N+. In the 78 patients who did not develop hepatic metastases, biliary CEA was within normal limits in 73/78, preoperative blood CEA was normal in 60/78, and 58/78 patients were at anatomopathological stage N-.

Seventy-six consecutive patients having undergone potentially curative resections of colorectal liver metastases in a single unit were followed up with a protocol of 3 monthly carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 estimations and contrast-enhanced spiral CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for the first 2 years following surgery and 6 monthly thereafter. The median period of follow-up was 24 months (range 18-60). Recurrent tumour was classed as early if within 6 months of liver resection. Thirty-seven of the 76 patients (49%) developed recurrence on follow-up. Nineteen recurrences were in the liver alone (51%), 16 liver and extrahepatic (43%) and two extrahepatic alone (6%). Of the 19 patients with isolated liver recurrence, eight developed within 6 months of liver resection none of which were resectable. Of the 11 recurrences after 6 months, five (45%) were resectable. Of the 37 recurrences, CT indicated recurrence despite normal tumour markers in 19 patients. Tumour markers suggested recurrence before imaging in 12 and concurrently with imaging in 6. In the 12 patients who presented with elevated tumour markers before imaging, there was a median lag period of 3 months (range 1-21) in recurrence being detected on further serial imaging. Seventeen patients who developed recurrence had normal tumour markers before initial resection of their liver metastases. Of these 17, 10 (58%) had an elevation of tumour markers associated with recurrence. Over a median follow-up of 2 years following liver resection, the use of CT or tumour markers alone would have failed to demonstrate early recurrence in 12 and 18 patients respectively. A combination of tumour markers and CT detected significantly more (P < 0.05) recurrence than either modality alone. Tumour markers and CT should be used in combination in the follow-up of patients with resected colorectal liver metatases, including patients whose markers are normal at the time of initial liver resection."}

To retrospectively evaluate the impact of 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to detect recurrent colorectal cancer based on asymptomatically elevated tumor marker level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Whole-body FDG-PET was performed in 50 patients suspected of having recurrent colorectal cancer and asymptomatically increased serum level of CEA (> 5 ng/mL), but other negative or equivocal imaging modality results. A blood sample was drawn in each case for CEA assay on the same day as the FDG-PET. The final diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer was established by operation/biopsy histopathological findings or clinical follow-up longer than 1 year by additional morphologic imaging techniques. Among the 50 patients, the final diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer was established in 64 lesions of 45 patients. FDG-PET could accurately detect 62 lesions but missed 2 false-negative lesions. In addition, there were 2 false-positive lesions. On a lesion-based analysis, the diagnostic sensitivity and positive predictive value of FDG-PET was 96.9%. There were 2 patients with false-negative lesions and 2 patients with false-positive lesions. Therefore, FDG-PET findings could lead to successful surgical resection in 41 (82.0%) patients. In addition, on a patient-based analysis, the diagnostic sensitivity and positive predictive value of FDG-PET was 95.3%. FDG-PET is a useful technique for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer suspected by asymptomatically elevated serum level of CEA and has an important clinical impact on the management in patients with suspected recurrent colorectal cancer."}

From 1995 to 2000, 108 patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, underwent curative surgery and enrolled in this prospective study. The 5-year survival group had significantly lower portal CEA levels compared to the hepatic metastasis outcome group. CEA mRNA was positive in the draining venous blood from 12 (11.1%) out of 108 patients included in the study. The rate of positive tumor cell detection in portal blood was significantly higher in the hepatic metastasis outcome group than in the 5-year survival and recurrence group. The proportion of patients with portal CEA > or =5 ng/ml was greater in patients with higher stage than in patients with lower stage. Positive CEA mRNA in draining venous blood predicted hepatic metastases and local recurrence with accuracy over 80% but with low sensitivity of 30% and 9%, respectively. Moreover, CEA level was a sensitive indicator in hepatic metastases as sensitivity was 95% and a specific indicator in predicting 5-year survival with specificity 84%."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring in patients with stage I-IV colorectal cancer has been, and remains, a controversial issue in oncology practice. Recommendations vary from bimonthly monitoring to no monitoring in the surveillance setting (for stage I-III disease). In the metastatic setting, there are no clear guidelines for CEA follow-up, although continued monitoring in such patients is common in the oncology community. This manuscript reviews the accuracy of CEA testing, its value as a prognostic indicator, and its role in surveillance and response assessment. The limitations of the test in the adjuvant and metastatic settings are illustrated through several case reports from the Colorectal Oncology Clinic at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Guidelines for CEA monitoring are provided, based on a detailed literature review and institutional experience."}

Early recurrence is a major problem after hepatic resection of colorectal hepatic metastasis (CHM). Our aim was to investigate the relationship between time to recurrence after CHM resection and overall survival. A retrospective analysis was performed for 101 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection for CHM and have been followed more than 5 years. Among 101 patients, 82 (81%) had a recurrence. Overall survival of patients with recurrence within 6 months after CHM resection was significantly worse than that of patients with recurrence after more than 6 months (P < 0.01). Overall survival was poorer when time to recurrence was shorter. One of the reasons for poor prognosis of patients with recurrence within 6 months was that only a few patients could undergo a second resection for recurrence after CHM resection. Histological type, including poorly differentiated signet ring cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma in the primary tumor, bilobar metastases, microscopic positive surgical margin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) above 15 ng/ml had predictive value for decreased recurrence-free survival after CHM resection. Short time to recurrence after CHM resection correlates with a poor prognosis. Histological type of poorly differentiated signet ring cell or mucinous adenocarcinoma in the primary tumor might be a predictor for early recurrence after CHM resection."}

Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is being increasingly used for local control of hepatic metastasis from colorectal carcinoma (CRC). After surgical resection of colorectal liver metastasis, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values fall within 2 weeks, making this a useful parameter to follow shortly after surgery. Little is known, however, about the expected pattern of the CEA drop after RFA. From September 1998 to October 2002, RFA to CRC liver metastasis was performed on 144 patients. A subset of 17 patients were studied who had no evidence of extrahepatic disease preoperatively, had all detectable tumor ablated intraoperatively, and who on long-term follow-up (up to 15 months) had no evidence of recurrent disease. Serum CEA was determined preoperatively, on the first postoperative day, at 1 week, and every 3 months afterwards. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained every 3 months postoperatively. Ten (58.8%) patients showed an increase in CEA on postoperative Day 1, averaging 38.3% compared with the preoperative value. CEA then fell to 50% of the preoperative value, on average, on Day 7 postoperatively and only reached its nadir at 3 months. Unlike resection patients, those undergoing ablation show an initial rise in CEA, probably due to release from the ablated tissue. Although heating of RFA would be expected to destroy CEA, the initial rise and slow drop postoperatively argue for a release of immunoreactive CEA from the ablated zone. This slow decline in CEA indicates that several months should pass before assessing the extent of potential residual disease."}

Approximately 20%-45% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients ultimately develop local recurrence or metastasis following curative surgical resection. The latter is caused by tumor cells shed from the primary carcinoma prior to or during operation, currently undetected by standard clinical staging. Fortunately, the presence of tumor cells in peripheral blood can be detected by molecular methods and is being regarded increasingly as a clinically relevant prognostic factor. To detect the presence of circulating tumor cells and evaluate their relationship to postoperative metastatic relapse, we simultaneously examined human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), cytokeratin-19 (CK-19), cytokeratin-20 (CK-20), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA (messenger RNA) in the peripheral blood of 72 CRC patients and 30 healthy individuals. Using a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), these tumor-related mRNAs were amplified; in addition, analyses were carried out for their correlation with patients' clinicopathologic features, as well as the occurrence of postoperative metastasis. In RT-PCR analysis of the peripheral blood, 69.4% (50 out of 72), 66.7% (48 out of 72), 52.8% (38 out of 72), and 72.2% (52 out of 72) of CRC patients were positive for hTERT, CK-19, CK-20, and CEA mRNA respectively. All 30 healthy individuals were negative for hTERT and CEA mRNA expression, while 2 were positive for either CK-19 mRNA or CK-20 mRNA expression. The detection of CEA mRNA was significantly correlated with depth of tumor invasion (P=0.012), vessel invasion (P=0.035), TNM stage (P<0.0001), and postoperative metastasis (P<0.0001), while positive hTERT mRNA was correlated with TNM stage (P=0.037) and CK-19 was correlated with depth of tumor invasion (P=0.039) and postoperative metastasis (P=0.017). In addition, multivariate logistic regression showed that only CEA mRNA was an independent and significant predictor of postoperative metastasis (P=0.006). Our findings suggest that CEA mRNA may be a more reliable marker than hTERT, CK-19, and CK-20 for the detection of circulating cancer cells in the peripheral blood of CRC patients. Using RT-PCR for the detection of CEA mRNA is feasible and may be a promising tool for early detection of micrometastatic circulating tumor cells in CRC patients. CRC patients expressing positive CEA mRNA in peripheral blood have a significantly higher risk of postoperative metastasis. Nevertheless, confirmation of CEA mRNA as a prognostic predictive factor requires the continuation of patient follow-up."}

The purpose of this study was to determine if pretreatment serum albumin and cholesterol levels are prognostic factors in patients with colorectal carcinomas. Ninety-nine patients with colorectal carcinoma were included in this study. Retrospective data analysis included the clinicopathological parameters of age and gender; emergent surgical intervention; stage at presentation; tumor location, size, and differentiation; lymph node metastases; lymphatic, venous and perineural invasion; preoperative serum albumin, cholesterol, hemoglobin, and CEA levels; the presence of preoperative and postoperative metastases; and tumor recurrence. Low levels of serum albumin, advanced TNM stage, presence of venous invasion, and high CEA levels were independently correlated with prognosis in multivariate analysis. Advanced stage and low levels of serum cholesterol were found to be a statistically significant parameter for disease free survival. Mean serum albumin levels were found to be decreased in patients with advanced stage, which correlated with increased tumor burden. Although not statistically significant for cholesterol levels, the patients with low serum albumin and low cholesterol levels had shorter overall survival than patients with normal serum albumin and normal cholesterol levels. These results suggest that a preoperative low level of serum albumin can be an indicator for the malignant potential of the tumor and represents an unfavorable prognosis for patients with colorectal carcinoma."}

The risk factors for local recurrence and distant metastasis were analyzed. There were 150 recurrent or metastatic cases (15.7%) after radical resection during a median follow- up of 71 months. Recurrence and metastasis sites included pelvics(6.0%, n=57), liver (4.9%, n=47), lung (4.2%, n=40) and other sites (0.6%, n=6). The median recurrent interval was 18 months (2-85 months),with a median survival of 8 months (1-62 months) after recurrence. Re-resection of the tumors was performed in 23 patients(15.3% ), and the median survival of such patients was 30 months with a 5- year survival rate of 13.0%. There were significant differences in recurrence and metastasis considering age,family history of tumor,CEA level,T staging,lymph node metastasis,venous cancerous emboli and signet cell carcinoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent and aggressive types of cancer. Several clinicopathologic features have been studied to identify the prognostic factors that can provide information concerning the favorable or the poor outcome of colorectal cancer. In the present study, the relationship between serum CEA, p53 expression, and DNA index to the different clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal cancer patients was sought. Fifty patients with CRC were included in this study. p53 protein was detected immunohistochemically using specific monoclonal antibodies. Samples were investigated for DNA index using flow cytometry. In addition, the serum CEA was determined using ELISA. The results showed that 27/50 (54%) were positive for p53. Concerning CEA reactivity, it was found that 35/50 (70%) were reactive for CEA. These results indicate that CEA is more sensitive than p53 to detect colorectal cancer. There was a statistically significant difference between the recurrent and nonrecurrent groups in the CRC Duke's stages, survival time, serum CEA (p = 0.001, 0.016, < 0.001, respectively). Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test showed that the mean survival time for cases positive for both p53 and CEA is significantly different from cases positive for CEA only, positive for p53 only, and negative for both p53 and CEA (p = 0.0002). Survival time was statistically significant with respect to sex, p53, CEA, and Duke's stages (p = 0.006, 0.024, 0.001, 0.017, respectively). Cox regression model showed that the prognosis of colorectal cancer is influenced by sex, p53, CEA reactivity, and CRC Duke's stages (p = 0.014, 0.006, 0.019, 0.014, respectively). In conclusion, the use of more than one tumor marker may successfully aid in the prediction of colorectal cancer prognosis."}

This study critically evaluated the prognostic determinants for disease-free survival (DFS) after cryoablation for colorectal liver metastases. An observational cohort study of prospectively collected data on 135 patients who underwent cryoablation with or without resection for colorectal liver metastases was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the prognostic factors for overall DFS, cryosite DFS, remaining liver DFS, and extrahepatic DFS. Overall, 115 patients (85%) developed recurrence at the cryosite (44%), and the remaining patients developed recurrence at the liver (62%) and extrahepatic site (71%). In univariate analysis, preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were significant for overall DFS. Distribution of metastases, operation type, total number of metastases, number of cryotreated metastases, largest size of cryotreated metastasis, and postoperative CEA were significant for cryosite DFS. The number of cryotreated metastases and postoperative CEA were significant for remaining liver DFS. The largest size of cryotreated metastasis, and preoperative and postoperative CEA were significant for extrahepatic DFS. In multivariate analysis, resection plus cryoablation, < or =7 liver metastases and < or =3 cm cryotreated metastasis were independently associated with an improved cryosite DFS. Preoperative CEA of < or =5 ng/mL was independently associated with an improved overall and extrahepatic DFS. The role of CEA in colorectal metastasis is important.

The overall recurrence and metastasis rate was 19.74%, and the liver metastasis rate was 9.87%. Univariate analysis showed that blood transfusion, disease duration, tumor size, tumor movement, histological differentiation, Dukesostage, and lymph node involvement were correlated to recurrence and metastasis of colon cancer after operation; blood transfusion, serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tumor movement, histological differentiation, Dukesostage, and lymph node involvement were correlated to liver metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor movement, histological differentiation, and lymph node involvement were prognostic factors for recurrence and metastasis, while serum concentration of CEA, histological differentiation, and lymph node involvement were prognostic factors for liver metastasis. Tumor movement, histological differentiation, and lymph node involvement are important prognostic factors for recurrence and metastasis of colon cancer after radical resection.

Peritoneal cytology and CEA level alone were not sensitive, specific or accurate enough indicators in predicting survival, hepatic metastases or local recurrence. The analysis of patients with positive cytology and high peritoneal CEA level revealed that their combination can predict local recurrence with accuracy of 85%. The presence of free malignant cells, as detected by cytology and CEA level, in the peritoneal cavity of patients with resectable colorectal cancer had no detectable impact on survival, hepatic metastases or local recurrence rate.

The aim of this work was to study the long-term prognostic value of preoperative detection of circulating enterocytes in the blood of colorectal cancer patients using the CGM2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A nested RT-PCR with specific primers for CGM2 was used preoperatively to detect circulating enterocytes in 121 patients (64 men, 57 women; mean age, 70 years) with colorectal neoplasms. Circulating enterocytes were detected in 58/121 (48%) patients.

The univariate analysis revealed that anemia was associated with impaired LRS (better local control) but with improved DFS. In contrast, hemoglobin decrease during radiotherapy was an independent risk factor for DFS (risk ratio 1.97, P=0.04). During radiotherapy, only 30.8% of R0-resected patients suffered from hemoglobin decrease compared to 55.6% if R1/2 resection was performed (P=0.04).

N1,N12-diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm) and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine (DiAcSpd) are minor components of human urinary polyamine to which little attention has been paid until recently. HPLC analysis of urinary polyamines has revealed that the excretion of these diacetylpolyamines, in particular, into urine was frequently and markedly increased in association with every type of cancer so far examined. Remission was usually accompanied by recovery of urinary diacetylpolyamines to the normal level. DiAcSpm was more sensitive than CEA for detecting colorectal cancer patients, while DiAcSpd was highly specific for malignant conditions in that the excretion of the latter was scarcely elevated in cases of benign urogenital diseases. An ELISA procedure for rapid determination of DiAcSpm was developed to promote the clinical application of these new tumor markers, and subsequent studies indicated that DiAcSpm was elevated in 60% of colorectal cancer patients at early stages (stage 0 + I), whereas only 10% of these patients were CEA-positive. DiAcSpm may also be useful as a follow-up marker that is efficient for detecting recurrence and sensitive to changes in the clinical condition of patients. The evidence accumulated so far indicates that DiAcSpm and DiAcSpd are promising novel tumor markers. They deserve more intensive studies, including studies of their biochemistry and metabolism."}

We reviewed 631 patients who underwent potentially curative resection for stage II or III rectal cancer. Patients were categorized into three groups according to their serum CEA concentrations on the seventh day before and on the seventh day after surgery: group A, normal CEA level (<or=5 ng/mL) in both periods; group B, increased preoperative and normal postoperative CEA; and group C, continuously increased CEA in both periods. The prognostic relevance of the CEA group was investigated by analyses of recurrence patterns and survival. Stage III patients showed higher systemic recurrence (P = .001) and worse 5-year survival rates (P < .0001) for group C than for groups A and B. On multivariate analysis, the CEA group was a significant predictor for recurrence (P < .001; relative risk, 2.740; 95% confidence interval, 1.677-4.476) and survival (P = .001; relative risk, 2.174; 95% confidence interval, 1.556-3.308).

Unfortunately, most cases are often diagnosed at an unresectable stage when traditional follow-up methods are used. The impact of MRI surveillance on the early diagnosis of local recurrences has yet to be ascertained. Patients who underwent curative surgery for rectal and left-sided colon tumors were included in a program of pelvic surveillance by routine MRI, in addition to the standard follow-up protocol. Cases were then analyzed for mode of diagnosis, resectability, and overall survival. Pelvic recurrence was found in 30 (13%) of the 226 patients studied. MRI detected 26 of 30 (87%) and missed 4 of 30 (13%) cases with local recurrence. Of the latter, 3 were anastomotic recurrences. In 28 (14%) patients, local recurrence was suspected by an initial MR scan but cleared by subsequent MRI or CT-guided biopsy. Recurrent pelvic cancer was diagnosed by MRI with 87% sensitivity and 86% specificity. In 19 (63%) cases, CEA was abnormally elevated, and 9 patients (30%) were symptomatic. Surgical resection was possible in only 6 patients (20%). There was no difference between MRI and conventional follow-up tests in their ability to detect cases suitable for surgery. Pelvic surveillance by MRI is not justified as part of the routine follow-up after a curative resection for colorectal cancer and should be reserved for selectively imaging patients with clinical, colonoscopic, and/or biochemical suspicion of recurrent disease."}

The hilar lymph nodes were resected with the right upper lobe, and the initial diagnosis was colon cancer metastasis to the right hilar lymph nodes. Although the resection was incomplete, and no additional treatment was given, the patient remained free of recurrence for 10 years. This prompted us to reconsider our diagnosis using immunohistochemistry. The resected lymph nodes were found to be positive for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and cytokeratin 7, and negative for surfactant apoprotein (SAP), cytokeratin 20, and napsin A. The neuroendocrine markers and thyroglobulin were also negative. These findings led us to diagnose T0N1 lung cancer. There are reports of patients with clinical T0N1,2 lung cancer having exceptionally good prognoses despite noncurative treatment; however, to our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient with T0N1 lung cancer diagnosed by immunohistochemistry, with a good prognosis despite incomplete resection.

We wished to determine whether PET/CT could provide additional information in patients undergoing standard evaluation for primary rectal cancer. Thirty-seven patients (mean age, 58 years; range, 26-90 years) with a previously untreated rectal cancer underwent TRUS or magnetic resonance imaging, spiral CT, and FDG-PET/CT. The tumor location (low, < or =6 cm; mid, 7-10 cm; or high, > or =10 cm) and carcinoembryonic antigen level were recorded. Discordant findings between spiral CT and FDG-PET/CT were confirmed by histological analysis or imaging follow-up. FDG-PET/CT identified discordant findings in 14 patients (38%), and this resulted in upstaging of 7 patients (50%) and downstaging of 3 patients (21%). Although node-positive disease on TRUS/magnetic resonance imaging was associated with discordant FDG-PET/CT findings, this was not statistically significant. Discordant PET/CT findings were significantly more common in patients with a low rectal cancer than in those with mid or high rectal cancer (13 vs. 1; P = .0027). The most common discordant finding was lymph node metastasis (n = 7; 50%). Histological confirmation of discordant FDG-PET/CT findings was performed in seven patients, and in no case did FDG-PET/CT prove to be inaccurate. Discordant PET/CT findings resulted in a deviation in the proposed treatment plan in 27% of patients (n = 10).

Clinicopathologic data were analyzed retrospectively for 53 consecutive patients with 5 or more bilobar liver metastases from colorectal cancer who underwent hepatectomy with or without microwave ablation. Outcome measures were recurrence rate, recurrence pattern, and survival. Combined resection/ablation was performed more frequently in patients with more liver metastases (P = .03).

Chest X-ray and colonoscopy were performed yearly for five years and abdominal ultrasound was done every six months for the first three years and yearly afterward. Abdominopelvic computerized tomography was performed yearly for the first two years in cases with rectal cancer. If relapse was detected, all operable cases underwent surgery if possible.

Two hundred eight relapses were detected, 83.6 percent in the first three years and 73 (35.1 percent) underwent surgical resection. Carcinoembryonic antigen testing detected 44.2 percent of recurrences and 31.9 percent of them were operated on. Imaging techniques detected a lower percentage of recurrences (18.7 percent) but were more often resectable: 52 percent and 60 percent of the recurrences detected by computerized tomography and chest X-ray, respectively, underwent surgery.

The aim of this study was to determine if tumor-associated markers could detect disseminated malignant cells and so identify a subgroup of patients with early-stage colorectal cancer that were at risk of relapse. We recruited consecutive patients undergoing curative resection for early-stage colorectal cancer. Immunobead reverse transcription-PCR of five tumor-associated markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, laminin gamma2, ephrin B4, matrilysin, and cytokeratin 20) was used to detect the presence of colon tumor cells in peripheral blood and within the peritoneal cavity of colon cancer patients perioperatively. Clinicopathologic variables were tested for their effect on survival outcomes in univariate analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to determine whether detection of tumor cells was an independent prognostic marker for disease relapse. Overall, 41 of 125 (32.8%) early-stage patients were positive for disseminated tumor cells. Patients who were marker positive for disseminated cells in post-resection lavage samples showed a significantly poorer prognosis (hazard ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-19.6; P = 0.002), and this was independent of other risk factors.

The activity of oxaliplatin (OHP) and irinotecan (CPT) alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in advanced colorectal cancer is comparable, but there are limited data on the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in patients pretreated by irinotecan. We have analyzed retrospectively the survival of 77 consecutive advanced colorectal cancer patients treated with OHP after previous CPT therapy. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox regression method, with the results expressed as hazard ratio (HR). The median survival from the start of OHP therapy was 10.7 months (1-year survival 43%). The median survival was not reached in 10 patients treated by hepatic arterial infusion of OHP (>10.6 months). The median survival from the diagnosis of advanced/metastatic disease was 34.3 months. On multivariate analysis, hemoglobin <125g/L (HR=2.42), neutrophils <5200 per microL (HR=0.36), duration of advanced/metastatic disease <21 months (HR=2.40) and interval from last CPT administration <3 months (HR=0.27) were statistically significant (p<0.05) independent predictors of survival from the start of OHP treatment, but only hemoglobin (HR=2.07), neutrophils (HR=0.32) and CEA <100microg/L (HR=0.44) were independent predictors of survival from the last CPT. There were 4 treatment-induced deaths after combination of OHP and raltitrexed (TOMOX). More than 40% of patients pretreated by irinotecan survived 1 year after start of OHP therapy. The therapy was similarly effective as a second or higher line of treatment. Hemoglobin levels and neutrophil count were independent factors associated with survival. The number of toxic deaths observed after TOMOX is alarming."}

The patient was a 64-year-old female who underwent an abdomino-perineal resection for advanced lower rectal carcinoma. The tumor was a mucinous adenocarcinoma, type 2 in the Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma, and was measured 4.5 cm in size. Histologically, the tumor was considered to be stage II (a2, n1, P0, H0). She received adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU/LV. After 7 months from the surgery, the patient developed a hip pain. Pelvic CT scan revealed a 4.5 x 6.0 cm mass anterior to the sacrum. Consequently, a diagnosis of local recurrence with sacrum invasion was made. An operation, involving tissue expander placement in the pelvis and pelvic floor was made by dexon mesh, was performed. Radiotherapy was given to the pelvic region at a total dose of 65 Gy (given 2.5 or 3 Gy each x 25 fragments). Chemotherapy with CPT-11 (100 mg/body) and 5'-DFUR (800 mg/body) was administered for 3 cycles. CEA (ng/ml) was decreased within a normal range from maximum 13.8. No progression was detected on CT, and Hip pain had disappeared. Abscess in the pelvis by tumor necrosis was managed conservatively. In this case, tumor marker is within a normal range over 2 years and QOL was improved, suggesting that chemoradiation with a tissue expander may be effective."}

Clearance and biodistribution were monitored by whole-body readings and necropsy. Animals were monitored for 34 weeks with a determination of residual disease and renal pathology in survivors. Hematologic toxicity was assessed separately in non-tumor-bearing NIH Swiss mice. Hematologic toxicity was severe at doses of 100 to 200 microCi of (90)Y-IgG, yet mild in the pretargeted animals given 500 or 700 microCi of the (90)Y-peptide. Evidence of end-stage renal disease was found at 900 microCi of the pretargeted (90)Y-peptide whereas animals given 700 microCi showed only mild renal pathology, similar to that seen in control animals given (90)Y-IgG. Biodistribution data indicated that the average amount of tumor radioactivity by a 700-microCi dose of the pretargeted peptide over a 96-hour period was increased 2.5-fold (48 microCi/g) compared with 150 microCi of (90)Y-IgG (18.9 microCi/g). At these doses, survival (i.e., time to progression to 2.5 cm(3)) was significantly improved (P < 0.04) compared with (90)Y-IgG, with ablation of about one third of the tumors, whereas viable tumor was present in all of the (90)Y-IgG-treated animals.

Total of 21 patients with lung metastasis from colorectal cancer were included. They were treated with modified pharmacokinetic modulating chemotherapy (PMC). Eleven were also treated with RFA and/or radiotherapy (multi-modality group), and 10 were treated with chemotherapy alone (chemotherapy group). Characteristics and survival of patients in the multi-modality group were compared with those of the chemotherapy group. The median survival of all patients was 38.6 months after the initial PMC. The cumulative 3-year survival rate of patients in the multi-modality group was 87.5% compared with 33.3% in the chemotherapy group (p=0.0041). The course of multi-modality therapy was uneventful except for pneumothorax in those who received RFA. Although pneumothorax developed in 4 of 11 patients (36.4%) treated with RFA, all were able to receive chemotherapy within 2 weeks after RFA.

The following prognostic factors were considered: age, gender, stage and grade of differentiation of the primary tumour, node metastases, site of the primary colorectal cancer, number and diameter of the hepatic lesions, time interval from primary cancer to liver metastases, preoperative CEA level, adjuvant chemotherapy after hepatic resection, type of hepatic resection, use of intraoperative ultrasound and portal triad clamping, blood loss and transfusions, postoperative complications and hospital stay, tumour-free surgical margins, clinical risk score (as defined by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre group, MSKCC-CRS).

No single prognostic factor turned out to be associated with such disappointing outcomes after hepatic surgery for colorectal liver metastases as to permit the identification of specific subgroups of patients to be excluded on principle from undergoing liver resection. However, in the presence of a number of specific prognostic factors (G3-G4 grade of differentiation of the primary tumour, preoperative CEA level > 5 ng/ml, high MSKCC-CRS) enrolment of the patient in trials exploring new diagnostic tools or new adjuvant treatments may be suggested to improve the preoperative staging of the disease and reduce the incidence of tumour recurrence after liver resection."}

Although computed tomography and colonoscopic examination were performed, lung, liver and local recurrence in the colon were not detected. FDG-PET was then performed and detected a higher concentration of FDG at the port site in the abdominal wall. Port site recurrence was diagnosed clinically and surgical resection of tumor at the port site was performed.

We used the RAND Corporation/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method (RAM) assessing strategies of resection, local ablation and chemotherapy. After a comprehensive literature review, an expert panel rated appropriateness of each treatment option for a total of 1,872 ratings decisions in 252 cases. A decision model was constructed, consensus measured and results validated using 48 virtual cases, and 34 real cases with known outcomes. Consensus was achieved with overall agreement rates of 93.4 to 99.1%. Absolute resection contraindications included unresectable extrahepatic disease, more than 70% liver involvement, liver failure, and being surgically unfit. Factors not influencing treatment strategy were age, primary tumor stage, timing of metastases detection, past blood transfusion, liver resection type, pre-resection carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and previous hepatectomy. Immediate resection was appropriate with adequate radiologically-defined resection margins and no portal adenopathy; other factors included presence of < or = 4 or > 4 metastases and unilobar or bilobar involvement. Resection was appropriate postchemotherapy, independent of tumor response in the case of < or = 4 metastases and unilobar liver involvement. Resection was appropriate only for > 4 metastases or bilobar liver involvement, after tumor shrinkage with chemotherapy. When possible, resection was preferred to local ablation. The results were incorporated into a decision matrix, creating a computer program (OncoSurge). This model identifies individual patient resectability, recommending optimal treatment strategies.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of PKR in lymph node negative rectal cancer. Forty-three patients with stage II rectal carcinoma who underwent potentially curative resection followed by post-operative adjuvant chemoradiation and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy were investigated immunohistochemically using the monoclonal antibody TJ4C4. Overall scores for PKR expression were calculated based on staining intensity and immunoreactive tumor cell fraction. Clinical information, including tumor grade, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated and compared with the degree of PKR expression. The median follow-up duration was 53.2 months, and median patient age was 55 years (range 33-73). No relationships were found between PKR score and age, sex, tumor grade or CEA level; however, smaller tumors (< or =5 cm) were associated with high PKR score (P = 0.025).

Despite the complete resection, metastatic adenocarcinoma developed five months after surgery. CEA-producing adenocarcinoma from a TGC is extremely rare and only two cases, including this case, have been reported in the English medical literature. Besides CEA, the serum levels of CA 19-9 became markedly elevated in this patient. Given that the serum CEA level decreased to the normal range after complete resection of tumor and that the tumor recurrence was associated with a rebound of the CEA serum level, our case shows that serial measurements of serum CEA can be used for treatment planning and for assessing the patient's treatment response for this rare disease."}

The obtained results in investigated group show significantly statistical. The relapse was confirmed by using CEA concentration in 42 patients (89.4%). In case of TPS concentration relapse was confirmed in 38 patients (80.85%). The relapse was detected in 45 patients (95.74) if increase in CEA or TPS concentration was treated as a way of detecting relapse. TPS markers point out that the increase of TPS concentartion may be ahead of relapse symptoms at about 2-6 months.

{"id": "16100946", "title": "Carcinoembryonic antigen in the staging and follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer.", "content": "Carcinoembryonic antigen in the staging and follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer. CEA is a complex glycoprotein produced by 90% of colorectal cancers and contributes to the malignant characteristics of a tumor. It can be measured in serum quantitatively, and its level in plasma can be useful as a marker of disease. Because of its lack of sensitivity in the early stages of colorectal cancer, CEA measurement is an unsuitable modality for population screening. An elevated preoperative CEA is a poor prognostic sign and correlates with reduced overall survival after surgical resection of colorectal carcinoma. A failure of the CEA to return to normal levels after surgical resection is indicative of inadequate resection of occult systemic disease. Frequent monitoring of CEA postoperatively may allow identification of patients with metastatic disease for whom surgical resection or other localized therapy might be potentially beneficial. To identify this group, serial CEA measurement appears to be more effective than clinical evaluation or any other diagnostic modality, although its sensitivity for detecting recurrent disease is not as high for locoregional or pulmonary metastases as it is for liver metastases. Several studies have shown that a small percentage of patients followed postoperatively with CEA monitoring and who undergo CEA-directed salvage surgery for metastatic disease will be alive and disease-free 5 years after surgery. Furthermore, CEA levels after salvage surgery do appear to predict survival in patients undergoing resection of liver or pulmonary metastases. However, several authors argue that CEA surveillance is not cost-effective in terms of lives saved. In support of this argument, there is no clear difference in survival after resection of metastatic disease with curative intent between patients in whom the second-look surgery was performed on the basis of elevated CEA levels and those with other laboratory or imaging abnormalities. There is also no clear consensus on the frequency or duration of CEA monitoring, although the ASCO guidelines currently recommend every 2-3 months for at least 2 years after diagnosis. In the follow-up of patients undergoing palliative therapy, the CEA level correlates well with response, and CEA is indicative of not only response but may also identify patients with stable disease for whom there is also a demonstrated benefit in survival and symptom relief with combination chemotherapy. More recently, scintigraphic imaging after administration of radiolabeled antibodies afforded an important radionuclide technique that adds clinically significant information in assessing the extent and location of disease in patients with colorectal cancer above and beyond or complementary to conventional imaging modalities. Immunotherapy based on CEA is a rapidly advancing area of clinical research demonstrating antibody and T-cell responses."}

Endoscopy is employed frequently; imaging tests are employed less often. The observed variation in the intensity of postoperative monitoring is of concern."}

Nodal expression of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), and guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) genes was measured in tandem in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) to assess whether there would be sufficient agreement between these markers in their ability to detect micrometastasis to qualify one of them as a universal marker, and whether frozen and paraffin wax embedded tissues would yield similar results. One hundred and seventy five frozen lymph nodes (FT) and 158 formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded lymph nodes (PET) from 28 CRC cases were analysed using gene specific quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, carried out on the LightCycler system with SYBR Green chemistry. There was significant disparity in positive detection of the three biomarkers in FT versus PET, with notable agreement achieved only for CEA (66.6%) in FT versus PET in Dukes' B disease, and between CK20 and GCC (44.6%) in FT, also in Dukes' B disease. One patient with full concordance in all three tumour markers with both tissue types suffered a relapse and died within two years of follow up. There was considerable discordance in the positive detection of the three tumour markers in both tissue types (FT versus PET). This brings into question whether using a single tumour marker to detect micrometastasis in one tissue type (FT or PET) is adequately representative, and challenges the concept of universal markers for molecular CRC metastatic detection. Multiple tumour markers would predict more accurately the metastatic potential of Dukes' B CRCs."}

The rates of survival and distant and local recurrences were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards (median follow-up 8 years). Multivariate analysis was used to assess the prognostic value of CEA and CA 19-9. The 5-year actuarial rates for patients with normal (n =118) and elevated (n=88) CEA values were as follows: overall survival 62.4% and 32.0% (p<0.001), local control 73.5% and 55.0% (p=0.007), and absence of distant metastasis 83.3% and 88.0% (n.s.), respectively. Similar results were obtained for patients with normal (n=82) and elevated (n = 10) CA 19-9 values: overall survival 60.7% and 14.0% (p=0.007), local control 83.7% and 80.0% (n.s.), and absence of distant metastasis 64.9% and 75.0% (n.s.), respectively. After adjustment for TNM stage, sex, age, LDH, tumor site and grading, the elevation of CEA proved to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (relative risk of 1.01 per ng/ml, CI 1.002 - 1.01; p=0.005).

Prior to the detection of recurrent disease or metastasis in potentially curatively operated colorectal cancer patients, the changes in proMMP-2, -9 and CEA blood levels were determined. ProMMP-2 and -9 plasma levels changed little in this period and changes between patients with and without disease relapse were not statistically significant. In contrast, patients with disease relapse showed a significant increase (p = 0.002) in CEA in the two consecutive serum samples prior to the detection of recurrent disease or metastasis. Similarly, prior to death due to colorectal cancer, proMMP-2 and -9 plasma levels showed no significant change, whereas CEA levels increased considerably and significantly (p < 0.001) when compared to changes found in survivors.

Responses to liver-directed therapy with yttrium 90 microspheres (SIR-Spheres) and adjuvant intraarterial chemotherapy have occurred in patients with unresectable colorectal hepatic metastases who had received less than one chemotherapy regimen. Now, SIR-Spheres are being used to treat patients with advanced disease who have received multiple chemotherapy regimens. A retrospective analysis was performed to determine the technical feasibility of SIR-Sphere treatment in this population. The medical records of 12 patients with hepatic metastatic disease and intrahepatic progression after multiple chemotherapy regimens for unresectable colorectal hepatic metastases who were treated with one or two infusions of SIR-Spheres were retrospectively analyzed for demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment details, response, and survival. Twelve patients underwent 17 outpatient infusions of SIR-Spheres. Percent hepatic tumor volume was less than 25% in four patients, 25%-50% in three, and more than 50% in five. Treatment in 11 patients with bilobar disease was accomplished via single infusions in six cases and sequential unilobar infusions in five patients. A single infusion was used to treat unilobar disease in the remaining patient. Median prescribed dose was 39.6 mCi (mean, 37.2 mCi; range, 17-67.5 mCi); the prescribed dose exceeded the delivered dose in six infusions (35%) as a result of embolic arterial occlusion. Radiologic response was stable in five of nine patients. Carcinoembryonic antigen levels decreased in four of seven patients. Four patients received chemotherapy concomitantly or after completion of treatment. Gastric ulceration in one patient was managed nonoperatively. Median survival times from diagnosis and treatment were 24.6 and 4.5 months, respectively. Treatment with SIR-Spheres induces responses in patients with advanced unresectable colorectal hepatic metastases after multiple chemotherapy regimens. Inability to deliver the prescribed dose is related to the embolic effect of SIR-Spheres."}

This study was designed to evaluate the utility of fluorine-18-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in colorectal cancer patients with unexplained carcinoembryonic antigen elevation at different levels. Thirty-seven colorectal cancer patients referred for positron emission tomography after primary surgery who had serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels >5 ng/ml and negative or equivocal conventional imaging studies were analyzed. Patient status was determined by histopathology and/or clinical follow-up. Grouping as disease-free, potentially resectable, or advanced disease was performed. The management impact was defined as the percentage of patients with a true-positive positron emission tomography result. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of positron emission tomography for relapse detection were 89, 89, and 89 percent, respectively. The management impact was 68 percent. In 24 patients with carcinoembryonic antigen levels <25 ng/ml, positron emission tomography helped correct patient grouping in 20 patients (83 percent), including 8 in the disease-free group, 5 in the potentially resectable group, and 7 in the advanced-disease group. In 13 patients with carcinoembryonic antigen levels >25 ng/ml, positron emission tomography identified 8 patients in the advanced-disease group and 1 patient in the potentially resectable group but missed 2 patients with relapse and undergrouped 2 patients in the advanced-disease group as potentially resectable. 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography can help triage patients for appropriate management with unexplained carcinoembryonic antigen elevation <25 ng/ml. For patients with unexplained elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen >25 ng/ml, the utility of positron emission tomography is mainly to confirm the presence of advanced disease and occasionally to identify potentially resectable lesions."}

Records of 59 colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases, treated with hepatectomy (including 14 cases of anatomical segmentectomy and 45 cases of wedge resection) from Jan. 1987 to Dec. 1998 in Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were reviewed. Postoperative complications occurred in 4 (6.8%) patients, without surgical death. Survival rate was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression model. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 91.4%, 34.8%, and 21.9%. Survival rate was significantly lower in patients with heterochronia metastasis than in patients with synchronal metastasis (P < 0.05), and lower in patients with metastasis size of > 5 cm than in patients with metastasis size of < or = 5 cm. Univariate analysis showed that time of liver metastasis and metastasis size of > 5 cm were prognostic factors (P < 0.05); while node status of primary tumor, number of liver tumors, and carcinoembryonic antigen level had no significant relations with prognosis (P < 0.05).

Circulating cancer cells were detected in 80% and intrahepatic cancer cells in 37% of the patients, though without impact on cancer recurrence. The amounts of disseminated cancer cells were significantly increased after surgery. This increase was similar in patients treated with and without RFA. RFA caused complete tumour destruction. Curative surgery for CRLM significantly increases the amount of disseminated cancer cells.

A whole body emission scan was performed 60 minutes after injecting 370-555 MBq of F-18 FDG. \"PET volume\" and \"PET metabolic volume\" of tumors were measured on FDG PET images. Based on an isocontour plot of tumor mass at 2.5 SUV (standardized uptake value), the metabolically active tumor \"PET volume\" was calculated. \"PET metabolic volume\" was obtained by multiplying the \"PET volume\" by the mean SUV of the tumor. All recurrent or metastatic lesions were single or multiple lesions of measurable size (axial diameter > 1 cm, minimum \"PET volume\" 3.5 cm3), and were verified by operation or by other imaging modalities (CT or MRI). There was a linear associations between \"PET volume\" and serum CEA level. Further regression analysis by least squares showed a highly significant model with an equation of volume = 41.2 + 0.471 x CEA (r2 = 0.629). However, no such association was found between \"PET metabolic volume\" and serum CEA level according to the residual normality test. In conclusion, \"PET volume\" measured by FDG PET and serum CEA level in colorectal cancer are significantly correlated. Tumor volume determined by FDG PET can be used as an effective marker of tumor burden in postoperative patients with colorectal carcinoma."}

Twenty-three patients with resectable colorectal cancer were randomized to receive famotidine (n = 11) or placebo (n = 12). Famotidine was given for 1 week pre-operatively in a dose of 40 mg per day p.o. After resection, the specimens were analyzed histologically for lymphocytic infiltration by a pathologist blinded to the two groups. Lymphocytic infiltration more than 50 cells per high power field, involving more than 50% of the tumor-normal tissue interface was considered significant. The two groups were comparable for age, gender, pre-operative carcino embryonic antigen (CEA) levels and pathological stage. Significant lymphocytic infiltration was seen in 63.6% (7 of 11) patients in the study group compared to only 8.5% (1 of 12) patients in the placebo group (P = 0.005). Despite fewer recurrences and a longer survival in the study group, the difference was not significant.

Patient histories and physical examinations were not helpful for the diagnosis of local recurrences; neither were laboratory routine screenings meaningful. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19 - 9 tests, ultrasonographic studies, chest XD-rays and colonoscopic procedures had a higher diagnostic value on the other hand. We demonstrated the problematic nature of the evaluation of different follow-up tests concerning their validity as they were part of a complex postoperative surveillance program. It is also important to point out that the success of the postoperative surveillance depends strongly on the compliance of the patients. To increase this compliance we suggest that the follow-up of patients should be more strongly oriented towards the incidence of recurrences."}

We analyzed the efficacy of isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) for patients with progressive CRC liver metastases after irinotecan. Between March 1993 and February 2003, 124 patients with CRC liver metastases underwent IHP on institutional review board-approved protocols. The overall treatment mortality was 4% (5 of 124). Twenty-five patients (10 women and 15 men; mean age, 53 years) were identified who had progressive liver metastases by carcinoembryonic antigen, imaging studies, or both after irinotecan. A 1-hour hyperthermic IHP (mean hepatic temperature, 40.0 degrees C) with melphalan 1.5 mg/kg (mean total dose, 100 mg) was administered via laparotomy. Perfusion with an oxygenated extracorporeal circuit was established with inflow via a cannula in the gastroduodenal artery and common hepatic artery inflow occlusion. Outflow was via a cannula in an isolated segment of the inferior vena cava. During IHP, portal and inferior vena caval flow were shunted to the axillary vein. Patients were assessed for radiographical response, recurrence pattern, and survival. The mean number of prior irinotecan cycles in 25 patients was 6 (range, 2-14), and it was given primarily as second-line therapy. The median number of liver metastases before IHP was 10 (range, 1-50), and the median percentage of hepatic replacement by tumor was 25%. The mean operative time was 9 hours (range, 6-12 hours), and the median hospital stay was 11 days (range, 8-76 days).

Measurement of urinary DiAcSpm using this ELISA system revealed that DiAcSpm is able to detect early stage (m and sm) colon cancers which CEA and CA19-9 cannot detect. DiAcSpm may also serve as a prognostic indicator and a marker for recurrence of colon cancer. Urinary DiAcSpm is elevated in metastatic and primary brain tumors including grade 3 and 4 gliomas and primary central nervous system lymphoma. In these primary brain tumors changes in urinary DiAcSpm were well correlated with the efficacy of treatments, recurrence of disease and increased malignancy of a tumor. DiAcSpm may be useful as a comprehensive indicator of the activeness of a brain tumor lesion in a patient. DiAcSpm was elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma, but patients with liver cirrhosis also showed considerably elevated levels of DiAcSpm."}

This study examines surgical salvage of locally recurrent rectal cancer following transanal excision of early tumors. Through retrospective review of a colorectal database we identified 50 patients who underwent attempted surgical salvage for local recurrence following initial transanal excision of T1 or T2 rectal cancer. Eight patients had resectable synchronous distant disease. Clinicopathologic variables were associated with extent of surgery required for salvage and outcome. Salvage procedures included abdominoperineal resection (31), low anterior resection (11), total pelvic exenteration (4), and transanal excision (3). One patient had unresectable disease at exploration, requiring diverting ostomy. Of the 49 patients who underwent successful salvage, 27 (55 percent) required an extended pelvic dissection with en bloc resection of one or more of the following structures: pelvic sidewall and autonomic nerves (18); coccyx or portion of sacrum (6); prostate (5); seminal vesicle (5); bladder (4); portion of the vagina (3); ureter (2); ovary (1); and uterus (1). Complete pathologic resection (R0) was accomplished in 47 of 49 patients. Of the eight patients with distant and local recurrence, two underwent synchronous resection and six had delayed metastasectomy. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 29 patients had recurred or died of disease at the time of this analysis. Five-year disease-specific survival was 53 percent. Factors predictive of survival included evidence of any mucosal recurrence on endoscopy, low presalvage carcinoembryonic antigen, and absence of poor pathologic features (lymphovascular and perineural invasion). Patients who required an extended pelvic resection had a worse survival rate. Pelvic recurrence following transanal excision of early rectal cancer is often locally advanced, requiring an extended pelvic dissection with en bloc resection of adjacent pelvic organs to achieve salvage. The long-term outcome in patients undergoing resection is less than expected, considering the early stage of their initial disease. When contemplating local excision for early rectal cancer, the risk of local recurrence, the extent and morbidity of surgery required for salvage, and the modest cure rate following salvage should be considered."}

We investigated whether preoperative serum vascular endothelial growth factor can provide any relevant clinical prognostic information during long-term follow-up of colorectal cancer patients. Preoperative serum samples of 79 colorectal cancer patients and serum of 28 healthy controls were stored at -80 degrees C until later vascular endothelial growth factor analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique and carcinoembryogenic antigen concentration measurement were performed. There were three patient groups for comparison: 21 patients with overt liver metastases, 18 patients who developed recurrent disease after initial curative surgery, and 40 patients who remained disease-free for at least five years. We could not demonstrate any significant difference in serum vascular endothelial growth factor values between the patient groups and controls, nor between the three patient groups (Mann-Whitney U test). There was no relevant correlation between serum vascular endothelial growth factor and carcinoembryogenic antigen concentrations (Pearson r = 0.2; P = 0.07). Although vascular endothelial growth factor has been shown in previous studies to be a potent inducer of angiogenesis and metastases formation, the present data demonstrate that preoperative serum vascular endothelial growth factor concentration does not provide any relevant individual prognostic information in patients with colorectal cancer."}

In this study, we analyzed the Norwegian guidelines for systematic follow-up after curative colorectal cancer surgery in a large single institution. Three hundred fourteen consecutive unselected patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal cancer between 1996 and 1999 were studied with regard to asymptomatic curable recurrence, compliance with the program, and cost. Follow-up included carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) interval measurements, colonoscopy, ultrasonography of the liver, and radiography of the chest. In 194 (62%) of the patients, follow-up was conducted according to the Norwegian guidelines. Twenty-one patients (11%) were operated on for curable recurrence, and 18 patients (9%) were disease free after curative surgery for recurrence at evaluation. Four metachronous tumors (2%) were found. CEA interval measurement had to be made most frequently (534 tests needed) to detect one asymptomatic curable recurrence. Follow-up program did not influence cancer-specific survival. Overall compliance with the surveillance program was 66%, being lowest for colonoscopy (55%) and highest for ultrasonography of the liver (85%). The total program cost was 228,117 euro (US 280,994 dollars), translating into 20,530 euro (US 25,289 dollars) for one surviving patient after surgery for recurrence. The total diagnosis yield with regard to disease-free survival after surgery for recurrence was 9%. Compliance was moderate.

Cancer survivors are at increased risk for recurrence of their original malignancy; development of second primary malignancies; and medical, developmental, and psychologic problems resulting from cancer therapy, genetic predisposition to cancer, and other risk factors. Surveillance following curative cancer treatment generally includes interval history and physical examinations every six months for five years. Thereafter, histories and examinations are recommended annually for breast cancer; every three months for two years, then every six months for three to five years for colorectal cancer; and every six months for five years, then annually for prostate cancer. Recommended laboratory tests and ancillary procedures include annual mammography of preserved breast tissue in breast cancer survivors, carcinoembryonic antigen level monitoring in conjunction with annual colonoscopy in colorectal cancer patients, and prostate-specific antigen measurements every six months for five years and then annually in prostate cancer survivors. In addition, family physicians should be attentive to concerns about altered body image or sexuality issues following curative surgical procedures. Continued emphasis on preventive health practices is encouraged. Physicians should remain alert to nonspecific symptoms or physical findings (e.g., mass, adenopathy) that can indicate cancer recurrence. In childhood cancer survivors, periodic evaluation that includes a plan for surveillance and prevention, incorporating risks based on previous cancer, therapy, genetic predispositions, personal behaviors, and comorbid health conditions, is recommended."}

The use of computed tomography scan (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis for surveillance of colorectal cancer (CRC) after primary curative therapy (PCT) remains controversial. Surveillance guidelines at Roswell Park Cancer Institute have included annual CT for the first 2 years after PCT. Isolated metastases from CRC may be amenable to surgical resection, potentially leading to a survival advantage. To assess this, a retrospective chart review of all 203 patients diagnosed with stage II or III CRC between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1995, was conducted. First-year surveillance CT (CT-1) was performed for 146 of 203 patients and 81 of 146 patients had second-year surveillance CT (CT-2). CT was considered \"directed\" when at least 1 of the following prompted evaluation: suspicious symptoms or signs, rising carcinoembryonic antigen, findings from colonoscopies, chest x-rays, or laboratory tests. Otherwise, CT was considered \"nondirected.\" Of 121 of 146 CT-1 and 63 of 81 CT-2 with nondirected CT, 7 of 121(5.8%) and 4 of 63 (6.4%) had proven recurrence, respectively. During 2 years of follow up, the estimated lower bound for detection of recurrence by nondirected CT was 11 of 121(9.1%). There were no apparent differences between the 2 groups in demographics, clinical presentation, surgical margins, treatment, tumor site, grade, or TNM stage. Surgical resectability of the metastases for directed and nondirected groups was 10 of 28 (36%) and 6 of 11 (54%), respectively. The median survival for the patients with recurrence in the directed and nondirected groups was 35 and 50 months, respectively. In conclusion, this retrospective study generates the hypothesis that CT surveillance may be of value. A prospective study, properly sized for power, is needed to answer this question."}

Colorectal cancers result from the accumulation of several distinct genetic alterations. This study was to investigate the frequency and prognostic value of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI) at 14 genetic loci located near or within regions containing important genes implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis. We studied colorectal cancers with corresponding normal mucosae in 207 patients (139 males and 68 females, mean age at the time of tumor resection 66.2+/-12.4 years, range 22-88 years). There were 37 right-sided colonic tumors, 85 left-sided colonic tumors and 85 rectal tumors. The distribution of tumor staging was stage I in 25, stage II in 73, stage III in 68, and stage IV in 41. We analyzed the LOH and MSI of HPC1, hMSH2, hMLH1, APC, MET, P53, NH23-H1, DCC, BAT25, BAT26, D17S250, MYCL1 and D8S254 with fluorescent polymerase chain reaction and denatured gel electrophoresis. High-frequency LOH was determined to be greater than three, or more than 50% of the informative marker with LOH. High-frequency MSI (MSI-H) was determined as more than four markers with instability (>30%). Correlations of LOH and MSI with clinical outcomes and pathological features were analyzed and compared. The occurrence of MSI-H was 7.25%, located predominantly in the right colons (7/15) and had a higher frequency of poor differentiation (6/15) and mucin production (7/15). LOH in at least one genetic locus occurred in 78.7% of the tumors and was significantly associated with disease progression. Of the 166 potentially cured patients, 45 developed tumor recurrence within 36 mo of follow-up. Clinicopathological factors affecting 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) were TNM staging, grade of differentiation, preoperative CEA level, and high LOH status. Patients with high LOH tumors had a significantly lower DFS (50%) compared with patients with low LOH tumors (84%). Of the patients developing subsequent tumor recurrence, the number and percentage of LOH were 2.97 and 46.8% respectively, similar to the stage IV disease patients. TNM staging had the most significant impact on DFS, followed by high LOH status. Clinical manifestations of LOH and MSI are different in colorectal cancer patients. High-frequency LOH is associated with high metastatic potential of colorectal cancers."}

One hundred blood donors formed the control group. Radical surgery was performed on 120 patients, with an average follow-up duration of 22.3 mo. Relapses occurred in 23 individuals after an average of 18.09 mo. CEA was assayed via the Delfia method with a limit of 5 ng/mL. Cytokeratins were assayed via the LIA-mat TPA-M Prolifigen method with a limit of 72 U/L. In the diagnosis of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, CEA showed a sensitivity of 56%, a specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value of 94%, a negative predictive value of 50% and an accuracy of 76.8%. TPA-M had a sensitivity of 70%, a specificity of 96%, a positive predictive value of 97%, a negative predictive value of 66% and an accuracy of 93.6%. The elevation of one of the markers was shown to have a sensitivity of 76.9%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 93.5%, a negative predictive value of 70% and an accuracy of 83.6%. There was no variation in the levels of the markers according to the degree of cell differentiation while there was an elevation in their concentrations in accordance with the increase in neoplastic dissemination. There was a statistically significant difference between the patients with stage IV lesions and those with stages I, II and III tumors. With regard to CEA, the average level was 14.2 ng/mL in patients with stage I lesions, 8.5 ng/mL in patients with stage II lesions, 8.0 ng/mL in patients with stage III lesions and 87.7 ng/mL in patients with stage IV lesions. In relation to TPA-M, the levels were 153.1 U/L in patients with stage I tumors, 106.5 U/L in patients with stage II tumors, 136.3 U/L in patients with stage III tumors and 464.3 U/L in patients with stage IV tumors. There was a statistical difference in patients with a high CEA level in relation to a shorter survival (P<0.05). However, there was no correlation between patients with high TPA-M levels and prognostic indices of patients undergoing radical surgery. Cytokeratins demonstrate a greater sensitivity than CEA in the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma. There is an increase in the sensitivity of the markers with tumor dissemination. Cytokeratins cannot identify the worse prognosis in patients undergoing radical surgery. Cytokeratins constitute an advance in the direction of a perfect tumor marker in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer."}

Mutation of p53 is a common event in colorectal cancer and can result in cellular accumulation of p53 protein and induction of p53 antibodies. We investigated the association of colorectal cancer with alterations in p53 DNA, protein and serum antibody levels to determine their prognostic value in colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer patients (n=167) who underwent surgery in Taipei Veterans General Hospital from January 1999 to December 2000 were enrolled [age 62.91+/-12.61 years (range: 22-85); 111 (66.5%) males]. Of these, 20 were stage I (12%), 54 stage II (32.3%), 58 stage III (34.7%), and 35 stage IV (21%). Median follow-up was 36.3 months (range: 4-58). p53 alteration was detected by DNA sequencing from exon 5 to 9 and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at two microsatellite markers near p53; and demonstrating intratumoral accumulation of p53 protein and detection of serum p53 antibodies using ELISA. p53 mutation frequency was 41.9% (70/167). Of 127 informative cases for LOH analysis, 73 (57.5%) tumors that had LOH had at least one microsatellite marker. Genetic p53 alterations were found for 56.3% of cases when LOH and DNA sequencing methods were combined. Genetic p53 alterations were associated with advanced tumor stage and tumor differentiation. Overexpression of intratumoral p53 and anti-p53 antibody positivity were 44.9% and 28.1%. The presence of p53-Ab was associated with p53 mutations (chi2 test, 42.9% vs. 17.5%, p=0.001), but not with overexpression of intratumoral p53 protein. The mutations at exon 6 (57.1%) and 7 (53.3%) were associated with presence of serum p53-Ab.

Rectal carcinoma is one of the most prevalent tumour types. Prognostic factors are of special interest to estimate prognosis of the individual patient. The data of 1,067 consecutive patients with solitary invasive rectal carcinoma, resected between 1988 and 1999 at the Department of Surgery of the University of Erlangen, were analysed. Cancer-related survival rate was calculated by univariate and multivariate analysis with respect to all relevant proven and probable prognostic factors. The R classification was found to be the parameter with the greatest influence on survival of patients with rectal carcinoma. Other tumour-related prognostic factors that influenced prognosis significantly were the anatomical extent, described by the TNM classification of the UICC, tumour grade and extramural venous invasion (EVI). In addition, the operating surgeon, a therapy-related factor, and the preoperative serum CEA level were found to influence prognosis. Tumour-related prognostic factors have the greatest influence on clinical decisions with regard to choice of a therapeutic concept. The increasing survival rates after treatment of rectal carcinoma have led to a focus on postoperative quality of life. Postoperative long-term global quality of life is similar to the preoperative level. Oncological outcome is still the most important factor, and tumour recurrence leads to a strong impairment of quality of life."}

The results of rectal cancer surgery are limited by the development of local recurrence (LR) that represents a great challenge to the surgeon. In the presence of unfavourable conditions for performing a curative operation, various forms of palliative treatment are indicated to control the patient's symptoms and the disease's complications. Recently, radiofrequency thermoablation (RFTA) has become a complimentary alternative therapy for malignant inoperable liver tumours. The present paper reports the use of RFTA in the management of pelvic recurrence of rectal adenocarcinoma. Fourteen months after abdominoperineal resection, a 32-year-old woman began to complain of progressive pelvic and lumbar pain. A large pelvic mass was found and serum CEA was elevated (66.4 ng/ml) at that time. Due to the dimensions of the presacral tumour (8 x 5 x 4 cm3) and the associated refractory pain, the patient underwent RFTA of the recurrent disease. Under epidural anaesthesia, a computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle electrode was introduced into the tumour. Although the procedure provided immediate pain control, the patient developed an intestinal obstruction 3 months later. This complication required surgical treatment to release adherences from the necrosed tumour. Apart from this complication, RFTA allowed prolonged relief of the pelvic pain and improved quality of life. Faced with an unresectable pelvic recurrence, RFTA proved to be a viable option for controlling pain, although a relatively high cost and eventual complications may limit its use."}

This review deals with the current, well-established indications for two-(18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning in patients with gastrointestinal cancers. FDG-PET is a non-invasive, functional imaging technique. FDG exploits the native glucose transporter to enter the cell. Since many tumours have enhanced glucose uptake, FDG is readily accumulated in malignant cells and can be detected by a PET camera. FDG-PET has been established as an important diagnostic tool in clinical oncology. This review deals with the current, well-established indications for FDG-PET scanning in patients with gastrointestinal cancers. In the current practice, FDG-PET is most commonly used to stage oesophageal carcinoma, to detect and stage recurrence of colorectal carcinoma and to differentiate between benign and malignant pancreatic lesions. The benefit of FDG-PET scanning in patients with oesophagus carcinoma is best established in stage IV disease, as the diagnostic accuracy to detect metastatic disease is higher compared to the combination of computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). In patients with a history of colorectal carcinoma, FDG-PET scanning is particularly effective in diagnosing recurrent disease, especially in those with a rising carcinoembryonic antigen without a suspect lesion on conventional imaging. Large series have indicated that the sensitivity and specificity for detecting recurrent colorectal carcinoma are in the range of 87%-100% and 66%-100%, respectively. Equally, FDG-PET has a high sensitivity (68%-96%) and specificity (78%-100%) in detecting pancreatic carcinoma in patients with a suspicious-looking pancreatic mass on CT scan. Lastly, we focus on the use of FDG-PET as a modality for early monitoring of treatment response in patients with gastrointestinal stromal cell tumours. Without doubt, future developments will further establish the diagnostic role of the FDG-PET scan in the care of patients with gastrointestinal cancers."}

The expression levels of cyclin E, p27 and mutant p53 proteins in 41 patients with stage II colorectal carcinomas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In the univariate analysis, the level of CEA at diagnosis was associated with disease relapse. In the multivariate analysis, the clinicopathological variables such as age, gender, site of primary tumor, tumor size, state of tumor differentiation and preoperative plasma CEA level were not associated with disease relapse. When Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to determine the prognosis, cyclin E, p27 and mutant p53 expressions did not predict poor prognosis. Our results suggested that the expression of cyclin E, p27 and mutant p53 proteins did not predict the clinical outcome in the stage II colorectal carcinomas."}

We investigated surgical indications, techniques to minimize blood loss and reduce complications, and oncological outcomes in 57 patients who underwent total pelvic exenteration with distal sacrectomy between 1983 and 2001. Forty-eight patients (84 percent) had negative margins. A comparison between two periods (1983-1992 and 1993-2001) showed that mean blood loss decreased from 4,229 to 2,500 ml (P = 0.002), indicating a favorable learning curve in minimizing blood loss. Two hospital deaths were observed in the earlier period and none in the later period. The most common sacral amputation level was the S3 superior margin, followed by the S4 inferior margin and the S2 inferior margin. The most frequent complication was sacral wound dehiscence in 51 percent, followed by pelvic sepsis in 39 percent. The incidence of pelvic sepsis in the later period was significantly decreased to 23 percent, compared with 72 percent in the earlier period (P = 0.046). Multivariate analysis showed that negative margins and negative carcinoembryonic antigen predicted improved survival. In 48 patients with negative margins, three-year and five-year disease-specific survival rates were 62 percent and 42 percent, respectively. Strict patient selection makes total pelvic exenteration with distal sacrectomy a feasible radical approach for fixed recurrent tumor. Careful performance of this surgical procedure along with the proper steps to decrease blood loss should achieve a favorable learning curve and low rate of surgical complications."}

The purpose of this study is to present the experience of our department regarding the importance of the systematic postoperative follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer, early diagnosis and treatment of the recurrence of the disease or a metachronous cancer. In a study that took place between October 2001 and February 2004 amongst 67 patients that were operated upon for colorectal cancer, 41 were systematically being followed up through CT scan, colonoscopy and tumour markers. In the 14th and 18th months postoperatively for 2 of the patients the CT scan showed hepatic metastasis, while the colonoscopy was negative. Regarding the tumour markers, one (CEA) was elevated in one patient while three were elevated in the others. For 2 out of the 41 patients the colonoscopy showed recurrence of the disease within one and two years respectively. The CT scan proved to be free of metastasis and the tumour markers were falling within the normal range for one of the patients while for the other CEA was elevated. Both patients underwent additional colectomy. Postoperative increase of the tumour markers was observed in 9 patients. The above patients had normal markers in the immediate postoperative period. For 4 out of the 9 patients recurrence or spread of the disease was observed while the rest of them are still being followed up.

When selecting patients who had undergone curative resection, the following patients were excluded from the study: 1) patients in whom extrahepatic metastases were detected on preoperative staging work-ups, 2) patients in whom the surgery was judged to be non-curative due to peritoneal seeding or local aggressiveness. Cases with follow-up periods of less than 18 months were also excluded, as these cases were considered insufficient to confirm the negative outcomes. Thus, a total of 149 patients were ultimately enrolled in our study. The follow-up results of unenhanced MR imagings were assessed according to the assumption that the newly developed hepatic metastases had been false-negative lesions on preoperative MR image.

Moreover it was shown that statistically significantly higher TAS values were associated with the progression of the large bowel cancer in comparison with the stomach cancer and that the blood cells TAS positively correlated with the changes of the Ca19-9, CEA and AFP concentrations in patients with progression of the cancer after radical treatment."}

Accurate detection of recurrent colorectal carcinoma remains a clinical challenge. 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography is new imaging technique that allows direct evaluation of cellular metabolism. This method is mainly used in oncology, especially in fusion with computer tomography (FDG-PET/CT, PET/CT Fusion). The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of FDG-PET/CT in diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer. The results of FDG-PET/CT scan performed in 120 patients who had suspected recurrence disease were analyzed retrospectively. The definite diagnosis was established on the basis of histopathological examination or clinical follow-up. FDG-PET/CT results were compared with 76 computer tomography (CT), 30 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 81 ultrasonography (US), 75 chest roentgenogram (X-ray) and 91 carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test. Recurrence colorectal cancer was demonstrated on FDG-PET-CT in 69 patients (57.5%). In 24 patients local recurrence, 33 liver metastases, 23 pulmonary metastases and in 36 other metastases were found. A total of 116 suspicious lesions were identified. The final diagnosis of recurrence was obtained in 56 patients (46.6%). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant findings were: for FDG-PET/CT 98, 94 and 97%; for CEA test 68, 82 and 72%; for CT scan 85, 91 and 89%; for RMI scan 96, 86 and 93%; for ultrasound test 71, 96 and 82%; for X-ray 87, 96 and 92%, respectively. FDG-PET-CT influenced surgical decisions in 23.6% of cases. FDG-PET/CT is a very useful diagnostic method in case of patients with suspected recurrence of colorectal carcinoma. Its usefulness is higher than the serum level of CEA and other conventional imaging modalities (CT MRI, US, X-ray)."}

The most effective treatment for acute or chronic liver failure is orthotopic liver transplantation. Worldwide there is a shortage of organs for transplantation. This shortage has called for research into new treatments for management of patients with liver failure. One such treatment is hepatocyte transplantation. During liver resections considerable amounts of normal liver are unavoidably resected. We aim to harvest these hepatocytes and to filter the tumor cells from them to provide a source for transplantation. After liver resection, the largest vessel at the resected liver edge was identified and cannulated. Seglen's two-stage technique of perfusing the liver with EDTA and collagenase was performed to harvest the hepatocytes. Ep-CAM Ags are consistently present on the surface of epithelial cells and in particular in colorectal cancer cells. Therefore, MOC31 antibodies (selective Abs for Ep-CAM) attached to magnetic beads were used to target the tumor cells. These tumor cells are selectively removed using a magnet. CEA staining was then used to ensure the hepatocyte collection was tumor cell free. Five million hepatocytes were rosetted with one million HT29 CRC cells to assess the immunomagnetic filtration technique. The hepatocyte harvesting resulted in 864,000 viable hepatocytes to be harvested per gram of liver. Histochemical staining using CEA demonstrated 75% of the HT29 cells in the hepatocyte collection were removed after one use of magnetic beads. We have demonstrated the successful initial stages of harvesting tumor-free hepatocytes from liver resected for malignancy."}

After 2 years from the surgery, the patient developed a perineal pain, and pelvic CT scans revealed a 4 cm mass anterior to the sacrum. The CEA level was increased to 11 ng/ml. Consequently, a diagnosis of local recurrence was made, and radiochemotherapy was commenced. Radiotherapy was given to the pelvic region at a total dose of 70 Gy (Given 2 Gy each x 35 fragments). Chemotherapy with CDDP and 5-FU was administered via the right internal iliac artery followed by administration of 5'-DFUR (600 mg/day). After that regimen, a recurrence of the pelvic tumor caused an increase in pain, and the patient developed renal failure. He died after 4 years and 10 months from the initial detection of recurrence.

Our aim was to assess the feasibility of using PET for quantifying metabolic response after intraarterial (90)Y-glass microspheres for metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver by comparing visual estimates with hepatic standardized uptake values (SUVs). Twenty-seven patients (15 men, 12 women; age, 68 +/- 12 y [+/-SD]) with metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver, and tumor progression despite polychemotherapy, were included. All patients had baseline CT or MRI, (18)F-FDG PET, hepatic angiography, and intraarterial (99m)Tc-labeled macroaggregated albumin scanning. Patients were treated with (90)Y-glass microspheres and were monitored for 3 mo using PET and serum carcinoembryonic antigen. The average absorbed dose was 139 +/- 22 Gy. All treatments were performed on a lobar basis. For each case analyzed, regions of interest were drawn along the liver edge to measure SUVs on maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) and resliced axial images. Concomitantly, the visual estimate was graded as +1, 0, -1, -2, or -3 for progression, no change, and mild, moderate, and dramatic improvement at posttreatment PET. Visual estimates placed 20 patients in the response category (-3 to -1) and 7 patients in the nonresponse category (0 to +1). There was a significant drop in the median SUV on the resliced axial images from 10,455 at baseline to 9,075 after treatment (P = 0.011) for the entire group. The percentage of metabolic response was significantly greater in the response group compared with that of the nonresponse group (-26% +/- 25% vs. +6% +/- 15%, P = 0.004). This correlated significantly with the respective visual estimates (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the direction of change agreed in 85% of patients using both methods. There was no significant correlation when the SUV from the simplified MIP images were used in the coronal or sagittal manner. It is feasible to quantify reduction of hepatic tumor metabolism objectively after (90)Y treatment for unresectable metastatic disease to the liver. SUVs of the entire axial slices of liver agree well with subjective visual evaluations. Quantitative PET is a useful technique in the treatment response evaluation of patients after (90)Y-glass microspheres."}

We identified 207 patients undergoing hepatectomy for colorectal metastases. Patient characteristics, clinicopathological features, sites of extrahepatic recurrence, and outcome are examined. Recurrence of the lung, brain, bone, and other site after hepatic resection was seen in 49, 8, 8, and 12 cases, respectively. Fourteen patients underwent pulmonary resection, and three patients are alive and disease-free survival was 35, 79, and 128 months after the second resection. Overall 2- and 5-year survival was 64 and 18%. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that time and number of pulmonary metastases, and serum CEA levels are independent prognostic factors. Surgical resection for brain metastasis was only in one case who survived for 31 months. Other treatment such as gamma-knife may not improve outcome. Both hepatic and pulmonary resection for colorectal metastases could prolong survival in selected patients. Surgical indication for other extrahepatic metastases must be strictly selected, although resection of brain metastasis might lead to better outcome."}

A postal questionnaire was sent to all consultant members of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland and of the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. The questionnaire assessed current practice for preoperative assessment and follow-up of patients with colorectal malignancy and timing of and criteria for hepatic resection of metastases. Number of referrals/resections were also assessed. The response rate was 47%. Half of the consultants held joint clinics with an oncologist and 89% assessed the liver for secondaries prior to colorectal resection. Ultrasound was used by 75%. Whilst 99% would consider referring a patient with a solitary liver metastasis for resection, only 62% would consider resection for more than 3 unilobar metastases. The majority (83%) thought resections should be performed within the 6 months following colorectal resection. During follow-up, 52% requested blood CEA levels and 72% liver ultrasound. Half would consider chemotherapy prior to liver resection and 76% performed at least one hepatic resection per year with a median number of 2 resections each year. A substantial proportion of patients are assessed for colorectal liver metastases preoperatively and during follow-up though there is spectrum of frequency of assessment and modality for imaging.

This study was to examine the expression, before and after operation, of CK20 mRNA in peripheral blood of patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma, to further explore hematogenous-spread micro-metastasis status of these patients, and significance of CK20 mRNA detection in treatment during perioperation period. Peripheral blood samples were collected before, and 2 weeks after operation from 62 patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma,and 22 controls (12 patients with benign gastrointestinal disease, and 10 healthy volunteers). CK20 mRNA expression in the blood samples was specifically detected by nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pathologic examination of all cases was done by conventional methods. Of 62 patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma, 34 (54.3%) have positive CK20 mRNA expression before operation,and so did 31 (50.0%) postoperatively, but no CK20 mRNA expressed in 22 controls. In patients of stageI-IV, CK20 mRNA positive rates were 37.5% (3/8), 36.3% (8/22), 66.7% (18/27), and 100% (5/5), respectively, difference between stage I+II (36.9%) and stage III+IV (83.3%) was significant (P< 0.05).

The study describes a case of a 42-year-old patient who underwent abdominoperineal amputation for the rectal carcinoma pT3 N1 M0 with complementary actinotherapy and chemotherapy. Three years after his rectum amputation, a CT scan disclosed a hypodense focus in his prostate of unknown origin.

The patient was administered 4 courses of chemotherapy with, basically, no signs of regression in the prostate foci. Biopsy from the suspicious focus was conducted transperitoneally, followed by its histological examination which confirmed cribriform adenocarcinoma. Our team decided on salvage cystoprostatectomy, securing urine derivation by the ilium conduit. 6 months later, the CT examination showed a massive local relapse and two metastatic foci in the liver, further oncological therapy was not indicated.

However, the modalities are neither formalized nor validated with regard to an improved 5-year survival rate. To compare the cost-effectiveness of both strategies for patient follow-up during the 7 years following curative resection of colorectal cancer, we performed a costeffectiveness analysis adjusted for quality of life. Using data from the literature and a population study, a simulation of follow-up on patients who had undergone curative resection of colorectal cancer was carried out over a 7-year period using a Markov model. Two Markov processes were modeled to compare the cost-effectiveness ratio adjusted for quality of life in patients with a follow-up in accordance with the recommendations of the 1998 French Consensus Conference (standard follow-up) with the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay and a simplified follow-up. The influence of standard follow-up on the quality-adjusted life expectancy of patients who had Duke's stage A and B colorectal cancer appears to be modest, with increases of 2.5 months and 1.3 months, respectively; it is more acceptable for patients who had had Duke's stage C, with an increase of 11 months. The high variability of cost-effectiveness ratios (> 7 years) of +/- 44,830 and 180,195 Euro per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively) did not favor the standard follow-up. The cost-effectiveness ratio (> 7 years) of patients having had Duke's stage C colorectal cancer was 1,058 (sd: 2746) Euro per QALY and could favor the standard follow-up. This study showed that standard follow-up with CEA assay tended to preferentially improve the survival of Duke's stage C patients. The type of examination needed and the frequency with which it has to be carried out should take account of the stage, treatment for the initial illness, and the patient's age."}

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical presentation as well as surgical intervention for ovarian metastasis from colorectal cancers identified during postoperative follow-up. Nine cases of ovarian metastasis were observed among 452 female patients with colon cancers between 1990 and 2000. Initial symptoms were pain (67%), pelvic mass (50%), vaginal bleeding (33%), and uterine bleeding (17%). On pathological evaluation, six cases (67%) were found to be moderately differentiated, and three (33%) well differentiated adenocarcinomas. Early diagnosis is very difficult. The growth of metastatic ovarian tumors are slow in elder patients, its growth is rapid in younger patients, and frequently diagnosed as huge ovarian tumors. In some cases, as cystic ovarian lesions they were identified in their early stage but could not be diagnosed as ovarian metastases, later curative operation could not be performed. The consulting gynecologist could not reach the correct diagnosis. Regular postoperative pelvic CT or MRI should be helpful for diagnosis. Although serum CEA levels did not increase in most cases, tumor markers CA125 and SLX were elevated in several cases, and thus may be useful for the detection of ovarian metastases. Surgical treatment consisted of bilateral and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or pelvic exenteration and additional hysterectomy for one patient because of association with cervical cancer. The median survival time after the primary operation was 20.8 months, ranging from 3 to 96 months. Peritoneal dissemination and bone metastases were frequently observed as recurrence after these operations. Two cases (non-synchronous solitary metastasis or direct involvement, located in the pelvis) survived more than 5 years (85 and 96 months, respectively), and both patients were treated with pelvic exenteration. This suggests that in general most cases with ovarian metastasis have a poor prognosis and that radical operation such as pelvic exenteration can improve survival only in cases of recurrent solitary ovarian metastasis or local extended disease, i.e. when the lesion is located only in the pelvis."}

Specimens included 400 lymph nodes from 64 patients undergoing colon resections. Specimens were tested by immunohistochemistry and by RT-PCR using nested primers for CEA. Specimens from 59 patients that were positive by nested RT-PCR were further quantified by detection of CEA mRNA fluorescence increase at a threshold PCR cycle. CEA was detected by nested RT-PCR analysis in 4 of 34 (12%) nodes of nonneoplastic disease, 2 of 13 (15%) nodes from T(1)N(0) patients, 32 of 81 (40%) nodes of T(2)N(0) patients, 49 of 109 (45%) nodes from T(3)N0 patients, and 92 of 163 (56%) nodes from T(1-4)N(1-2) patients. The overall presence of any RT-PCR-detectable CEA in nodes did not differentiate patient groups. Immunohistochemistry was positive in nodes from 7% of T(3)N(0) patients and 100% of T(1-3)N(1-2) patients. CEA quantification revealed that 0 of 7 patients with nonneoplastic disease and 2 of 17 (12%) patients with stage I T(1-2)N(0) cancers had one or more lymph nodes with >/=1.0 x 10(2) CEA transcripts per sample.

AFP is specific to liver metastasis from gastric cancer, and CA 125 is also specific to peritoneal dissemination. CA 72-4 and NCC-ST-439 are useful markers for advanced staging. CEA, CA 19-9, is useful for colon cancer, especially for predicting preoperative staging. Half-life and doubling time of tumor markers is useful in some cases for the evaluation of operation and chemotherapy. We showed our data concerning postoperative CEA and/or CA 19-9 monitoring after operation for gastric cancer in 120 recurrent patients. Positivities of CEA and CA 19-9 for recurrence were 65.8% and 85.0%, respectively, both of which were significantly higher than the preoperative sensitivities (28.3% and 45.0%, respectively). In most patients with high levels of preoperative CEA and/or CA 19-9, these tumor markers increased again at recurrence. Recurrent diseases were detected between 5 months after detection by diagnostic imagings and 12 months before detection by diagnostic imagings (mean of 3.1+/-3.6 months before detection by diagnostic imagings) and between 10 months after detection by diagnostic imagings and 13 months before detection by diagnostic imagings (mean 2.2+/-3.9 months before detection by diagnostic imagings) by CEA and CA 19-9 monitorings, respectively. These results suggest that CEA and/or CA 19-9 monitoring after operation was useful to predict the recurrence of gastric cancer, especially in almost all the patients with high preoperative levels of these markers."}

Tumour markers are molecules occurring in blood or tissue that are associated with cancer and whose measurement or identification is useful in patient diagnosis or clinical management. The ideal marker would occur only in patients with malignancy, and would correlate with stage and response to treatment, however, to date there are few reliable prognostic markers in colorectal cancer (CRC), consequently much research is focused on identifying such markers. This review aims to summarise the most important currently available markers in CRC that provide prognostic or predictive information. Amongst others, it covers serum markers such as CEA and CA19-9, markers expressed in tumour tissue such as thymidylate synthase and also the expression/loss of expression of certain oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes such as K-ras and p53. The prognostic value of genomic instability, angiogenesis and proliferative indices such as apoptotic index is discussed."}

The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of FDG-PET on the surgical management of patients with known or suspected colorectal liver metastases. Patients undergoing FDG-PET for investigation of known or suspected colorectal liver metastases were identified from a South Australian database. Case notes were reviewed retrospectively to determine the influence of FDG-PET findings on patient management. Findings from FDG-PET scanning were compared with findings from conventional diagnostic investigations and operative findings. Overall, in four of 16 patients (25%) management was influenced by FDG-PET findings. FDG-PET altered management in four of eight (50%) patients with non-diagnostic liver lesions on computed tomography (CT) or with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels but no liver lesion on CT. In all eight patients with CT diagnosed resectable liver metastases, the addition of FDG-PET did not influence the management. The findings support the use of FDG-PET in the assessment of selected patients with suspected colorectal liver metastases and equivocal findings on conventional diagnostic investigation."}

The chimeric T84.66 (cT84.66) minibody is a novel engineered antibody construct (V(L)-linker-V(H)-C(H)3; 80 kDa) that demonstrates bivalent and high affinity (4 x 10(10) m(-1)) binding to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The variable regions (V(L) and V(H)) assemble to form the antigen-combining sites, and the protein forms dimers through self-association of the C(H)3 domains. In animal models, the minibody demonstrated high tumor uptake, approaching that of some intact antibodies, substantially faster clearance than intact chimeric T84.66, and superior tumor-to-blood ratios compared with the cT84.66 F(ab')(2) fragment, making it attractive for further evaluation as an imaging and therapy agent. The purpose of this pilot clinical study was to determine whether (123)I-cT84.66 minibody demonstrated tumor targeting and was well tolerated as well as to begin to evaluate its biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity in patients with colorectal cancer. Ten patients with biopsy-proven colorectal cancer (6 newly diagnosed, 1 pelvic recurrence, 3 limited metastatic disease) were entered on this study. Each received 5-10 mCi (1 mg) of (123)I-labeled minibody i.v. followed by serial nuclear scans and blood and urine sampling over the next 48-72 h. Surgery was performed immediately after the last nuclear scan. Tumor imaging was observed with (123)I-labeled minibody in seven of the eight patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. Two patients received neoadjuvant radiation and chemotherapy, which significantly reduced tumor size before surgery and minibody infusion. At surgery, no tumor was detected in one patient and only a 2-mm focus was seen in the second patient. (123)I-labeled minibody tumor targeting was not seen in either of these pretreated patients. Mean serum residence time of the minibody was 29.8 h (range, 10.9-65.4 h). No drug-related adverse reactions were observed. All 10 patients were evaluated for immune responses to the minibody, with no significant responses observed. This pilot study represents one of the first clinical efforts to evaluate an engineered intermediate-molecular-mass radiolabeled antibody construct directed against CEA. cT84.66 minibody demonstrates tumor targeting to colorectal cancer and a faster clearance in comparison with intact antibodies, making it appropriate for further evaluation as an imaging and therapy agent. The mean residence time of the minibody in patients is longer than predicted from murine models. We therefore plan to further evaluate its biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties with minibody labeled with a longer-lived radionuclide, such as (111)In."}

A 65-year-old man complained of severe abdominal distension, abdominal pain and pulmonary failure, and was diagnosed as having ileus due to descending colon cancer. The patient underwent urgent open laparotomy to release the ileus condition on March 5, 2002. During the laparotomy, we established a diagnosis of nonresectable descending colon cancer accompanied by severe peritoneal dissemination and therefore performed only double-barreled transverse colostomy. The postoperative course was very good. Pathological examination of omental dissemination demonstrated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and cytology of ascites was class II. The levels of serum CEA and CA19-9 were within the normal ranges. l-LV/5-FU therapy was initiated postoperatively. Seven cycles of this chemotherapy regimen was performed with no apparent side effect during the treatment. There was no postoperative accumulation of carcinomatous ascites. The patient gained 15 kg compared with body weight admission. On abdominal computed tomography (CT), the primary lesion of the colon decreased 98% and there was no ascites found.

We studied medical and economic data from the records of 256 patients registered in the Herault Tumor Registry who underwent potentially curative surgical resection in 1992. Recurrence, curative recurrence, survival, and the cost of follow-up tests were assessed respectively for at least 5 years. We analyzed the cost and effectiveness of follow-up tests in patients who received either follow-up with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring as advocated by the 1998 French consensus conference recommendations (standard follow-up) or a more minimal follow-up schedule. Nine patients died in the postoperative period. The 5-year survival rates in the standard and minimal follow-up groups were 85% and 79%, respectively (p=0.25). Cost-effectiveness ratios were 2123 in Dukes' stage A patients, 4306 in Dukes' stage B patients, and 9600 in Dukes' stage C patients. Cost-effectiveness ratios for CEA monitoring and abdominal ultrasonography per patient alive in the standard follow-up group were 1238 and 2261.5, respectively. Cost-effectiveness ratios for CEA monitoring and abdominal ultrasonography per patient alive in the minimal follow-up group were 1478 and 573, respectively. There were no survivors 5 years after a recurrence when the recurrence was detected by physical examination, chest X-ray, and colonoscopy in either follow-up group. Dukes' classification is a poor indicator of patient selection. The follow-up tests should only include CEA monitoring and abdominal ultrasonography for the diagnosis of recurrence."}

Univariate analysis showed the number of metastases, location (unilateral or bilateral), prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, hilar or mediastinal lymph-node metastasis, and Dukes' stage to be considerable prognostic factors. Among these, Dukes' A for the primary lesion and unilateral pulmonary metastasis were shown to be independent predictors of longer survival by multivariate analysis (p = 0.0093 and p = 0.0182, respectively). In patients treated with both pulmonary and hepatic metastastasectomies, a better prognosis was observed in those who received metachronous resection. Recurrence after a pulmonary metastasectomy frequently occurred in the thorax and the 3-year survival rate was 44.6% in patients who underwent a repeat thoracotomy. Patients with unilateral metastasis and Dukes' A for the primary tumor benefit most from the resection of pulmonary metastasis from colorectal carcinoma. Further, the number of metastases, prethoracotomy CEA level, and hilar or mediastinal lymph-node involvement should be considered to determine the operative indication.

The results obtained showed that sP-selectin levels were higher in patients with CRC compared either to patients with benign disease (p = 0.006) or controls (p = 0.003). No differences were observed between the latter and patients with benign diseases. Increased median sP-selectin levels were significantly associated with the presence of distant metastasis (68.2 ng/ml vs. 48.6 ng/ml, p = 0.002). Of interest, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were independently associated to sP-selectin (regression coefficient = 0.28, p < 0.002). Cox's proportional hazards survival analysis of primary CRC patients demonstrated that beside the stage of disease sP-selectin levels had an independent prognostic role in predicting recurrent disease (HR = 2.22, p = 0.019) and mortality from CRC (HR = 3.44, p= 0.017). These results suggest that measurement of plasma sP-selectin might represent a prognostic indicator in the management of patients with CRC."}

The evaluation of patients with known or suspected recurrent colorectal carcinoma is now an accepted indication for positron emission tomography using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) imaging. FDG-PET does not replace imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) for preoperative anatomic evaluation but is indicated as the initial test for diagnosis and staging of recurrence and for preoperative staging (N and M) of known recurrence that is considered to be resectable. FDG-PET imaging is valuable for the differentiation of posttreatment changes from recurrent tumor, differentiation of benign from malignant lesions (indeterminate lymph nodes, hepatic and pulmonary lesions), and the evaluation of patients with rising tumor markers in the absence of a known source. The addition of FDG-PET to the evaluation of these patients reduces overall treatment costs by accurately identifying patients who will and will not benefit from surgical procedures. Although initial staging at the time of diagnosis is often performed during colectomy, FDG-PET imaging is recommended for a subgroup of patients at high risk (with elevated CEA levels) and normal CT and for whom surgery can be avoided if FDG-PET shows metastases. Screening for recurrence in patients at high risk has also been advocated. FDG-PET imaging seems promising for monitoring patient response to therapy but larger studies are necessary. The diagnostic implications of integrated PET-CT imaging include improved detection of lesions on both the CT and FDG-PET images, better differentiation of physiologic from pathologic foci of metabolism, and better localization of the pathologic foci. This new powerful technology provides more accurate interpretation of both CT and FDG-PET images and therefore more optimal patient care. PET-CT fusion images affect the clinical management by guiding further procedures (biopsy, surgery, radiation therapy), excluding the need for additional procedures, and changing both inter- and intramodality therapy."}

From January 1985 to December 2000, 156 patients underwent curative liver resection in association with systematic hepatic lymph node dissection for colorectal liver metastasis. A first analysis was performed to assess the association between hepatic lymph node metastasis and patients' characteristics. A second analysis assessed survival after resection of liver colorectal metastasis by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Twenty-three of the 156 patients (15%) had microscopically involved hepatic lymph nodes. No predictive factor of lymph node metastasis was identified. Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node metastasis, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, number of metastases, and morbidity were factors influencing survival. The 3- and 5-year survival rates of patients with lymph node metastasis were 27% and 5%, respectively, compared with 56% and 43% without lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0001). During resection of liver colorectal metastasis, microscopic lymph node involvement occurred in 15% of the patients and was associated with a poor 5-year survival.

Early detection of tumor DNA in serum/plasma prior to the development of recurrence or metastases could help improve the outcome of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) after tumor resection. Recent advances in the detection of tumor DNA in the serum/plasma has opened up numerous new areas for investigation and new possibilities for molecular diagnosis. APC and K- ras mutations are considered to be early-stage developments of CRCs, whereas p53 mutations are thought to be relatively late events in the tumorigenesis of CRCs. The aim of this study was to search for the presence of genetic mutations in the DNA extracted from the serum of CRC patients and healthy subjects. We simultaneously evaluate the significance of APC, K- ras, and p53 gene mutations in cancer tissues and their paired serum samples of 104 CRC patients by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. Additionally, analysis was carried out to detect the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in CRC patients. Overall, we found at least one of the gene mutations in tumor tissues from 75% (78/104) of the CRC patients. Comparison of the three molecular markers showed that the detection rates in the serum were 30.4%, 34.0%, and 34.2% for APC, K- ras, and p53 genes, respectively. Of these patients, 46.2% (36/78) were identified as having positive serum results, whereas all healthy controls remained negative. The overall positive tumor DNA detection rates in the serum were 0% (0/7) for Dukes' A classification, 22.4% (11/49) for Dukes' B, 48.7% (19/39) for Dukes' C, and 66.7% (6/9) for Dukes' D. The detection rate increased as the tumor stage progressed ( p = 0.012). Concurrently, a significant difference was observed between lymph node metastases and positive serum tumor DNA detection ( p < 0.001). A significantly higher postoperative metastasis/recurrence rate in patients harboring gene mutations with serum tumor DNA than those without serum tumor DNA was also demonstrated ( p < 0.001). However, no significant correlation between the postoperative metastasis/recurrence and serum CEA levels was observed ( p = 0.247). These data suggest that the identification of circulating tumor DNA using the molecular detection of APC, K- ras, and p53 gene mutations is a potential tool for early detection of postoperative recurrence/metastases.

They are promising tumor markers, since their excretion is frequently elevated in patients with various types of cancers. DiAcSpm is sensitive in cancer detection, while DiAcSpd is highly specific for cancer. Diacetylpolyamines were initially characterized and determined by HPLC fractionation, followed by enzymatic detection. More recently, antibodies highly specific for DiAcSpm and DiAcSpd were developed, and an ELISA system applicable to the determination of urinary DiAcSpm was established. Measurement of urinary DiAcSpm using this ELISA system revealed that DiAcSpm is a more sensitive tumor marker than CEA, CA19-9 and CA15-3 for colon and breast cancers. More importantly, DiAcSpm efficiently detects patients at early stages. On the other hand, CEA, CA19-9 and CA15-3 are quite insensitive for early stage cancers. The urinary DiAcSpm level tends to remain low even in tumor-bearing individuals when their cancerous lesions remain static, while it rises rapidly concomitant with recurrence. DiAcSpm may serve as a prognostic indicator and marker for recurrence of prostate and colon cancers. Diacetylpolyamines may turn out to be general tumor markers, since active proliferation of any cancer tissues would likely be accompanied by activation of polyamine metabolism."}

A postoperative follow-up of CRC patients classified as Dukes' stages A, B or C was performed and survival analysis was carried out to evaluate the impact of sialic acid levels on tumor recurrence. Our diagnostic studies indicate that TSA/TP is a better marker than either TSA or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), especially for the detection of CRC patients at an early stage. At a cutoff of 30.90 nmol/mg of protein, TSA/TP showed a sensitivity of 85% with a specificity of 97% to discriminate CRC patients from healthy donors. In survival analysis, both TSA and TSA/TP were found to be significant prognostic factors for tumor recurrence in CRC. Furthermore, TSA/TP could distinguish patients at high risk of recurrence within Dukes' stage B and in multivariate analysis it was identified as the best independent prognostic factor.

All patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal metastases at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh between October 1988 and April 2001 were reviewed. Patients were allocated into one of three groups: standard group, extended group, and segmental group. Patient information was collected from a prospectively completed database. One hundred and thirty-seven patients had liver resections for colorectal metastases during the study period. There were 69 standard hepatectomies, 41 extended resections and 27 segmental resections. CEA level was significantly lower in the segmental group(p = 0.012). There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of median operating time (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test), operative blood loss (p = 0.006, Kruskal-Wallis test) and post-operative stay ( p = 0.036, Kruskal-Wallis test). Major post-operative complications were similar between standard and extended resections but less following segmental resection (p = 0.050. Predicted median survival was 51 months following standard resection, 23 months following extended resection and 59 months after segmental resection ( p = 0.037, log rank test), however, there was no difference between the three groups for actual 5-year survival (p = 0.662, Pearson chi-square test). Morbidity and mortality rates were comparable with other previous studies as was overall survival, although survival in patients undergoing extended resections was reduced. There was an acceptable level of morbidity and mortality for all three groups. Patients undergoing segmental resection had fewer complications, shorter length of stay, and the longest median survival suggesting adequate oncological clearance. Segmental resection has a role for favourably placed tumour deposits if oncological clearance can be ensured. Extended liver resections have a role for selected patients with bilobar colorectal metastases or large solitary deposits close to the hepatic vein confluence."}

Cryotherapy has gained importance as a locally ablative treatment option for patients with non-resectable liver tumors, especially metastases from colorectal cancer. We have used this technique since 1996 for the treatment of 77 patients with malignant liver tumors. Patient data was prospectively recorded and follow-up was until September 2002 or death. Fifty-five patients had colorectal cancer liver metastases, 16 metastases from other primaries and 6 had hepatoma. Forty patients had cryotherapy only and 37 had an additional liver resection. Morbidity and mortality were 22% and 1.3%, respectively. In 68% of patients with colorectal liver metastases and an elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen-level preoperatively, it returned to the normal range following cryosurgery. For all 77 patients, median survival was 28 months with a 3- and 5-year-survival rate of 39% and 26%, respectively, and median survival was 29 months with a 3- and 5-year-survival rate of 44% and 26%, respectively, for the 55 patients with colorectal liver metastases. Local recurrence at the cryosite was observed in 13 of 65 patients (20%) with initially complete treatment. For cryotherapy to further establish as a treatment for malignant liver tumors in a time where many new local ablative techniques are developing, different goals need to be achieved. The trauma of the procedure and local treatment failure need to be minimized and survival results need to be optimized. Published studies and new possible fields of research regarding these goals are discussed."}

Colorectal cancer occurs mainly after the age of 50. The liver is the most frequent site of metastases, although isolated metastases to the porta hepatis are rarely reported in the literature. From 1924 to 1993, only 16 cases of periportal lymph nodes metastases were reported. We report a case of jaundice secondary to porta hepatis metastases from primary colorectal cancer. The appearance of symptoms was concurrent with the elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen in our case. This emphasizes the importance of polymerase chain reaction to detect the small amount of carcinoembryonic antigen transcript in blood or in peritoneal fluid before the appearance of symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction allows the prediction of high risk of recurrence and the presence of micrometastases. More trials are needed to assess the outcome after treatment by adjuvant chemotherapy for micrometastases."}

CA19-9 is often used in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen to manage patients with colorectal cancer, even though there is insufficient evidence to support this use of CA19-9. Carcinoembryonic antigen, by contrast, has been regarded as a better indicator of poor prognosis and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether CA19-9 is, in fact, a useful marker in the management of colorectal cancer patients by comparing it with carcinoembryonic antigen. A retrospective investigation was done for a consecutive series of 155 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent potentially curative surgery between 1995 and 1999. Excluded were patients with postoperative assays performed less than three times for either carcinoembryonic antigen or CA19-9 and those who had developed secondary cancers. Data from 118 patients were analyzed in terms of prediction of prognosis and detection of recurrences. The sensitivities of preoperative CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen were 29.8 percent and 45.3 percent, respectively. In the univariate analysis of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9 assays in 114 patients, high carcinoembryonic antigen level was significantly associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.0090) by log-rank test). We could not find a significant association between preoperative CA19-9 abnormality and survival (P = 0.12). Multivariate analysis of preoperative factors indicated significance in TNM stage (P = 0.0094) and tumor location (P = 0.036) but in neither carcinoembryonic antigen (P = 0.061) nor CA19-9 (P = 0.22). Among 40 patients with recurrences, postoperative elevations of tumor markers were seen in 19 cases for CA19-9 and in 37 for carcinoembryonic antigen throughout the follow-up periods. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.48, 0.88, 0.68, and 0.77, respectively, for CA19-9, and 0.93, 0.88, 0.80, and 0.96, respectively, for carcinoembryonic antigen. In patients with recurrences, the initial postoperative elevation of tumor markers was seen earlier than the detection of recurrence in 68.4 percent of those with CA19-9 elevation and in 67.6 percent of those with carcinoembryonic antigen elevation. There was only one patient with recurrence who had CA19-9 elevation without carcinoembryonic antigen elevation, while 19 recurrent patients had carcinoembryonic antigen elevation without CA19-9 elevation. Multivariate analysis showed a significant risk of carcinoembryonic antigen elevation against recurrence with an odds ratio of 32.0 (P < 0.0001), in contrast to an insignificant association of CA19-9 elevation (P = 0.23). We could not find clinical significance to support the use of CA19-9 to predict the prognosis and detect recurrence of colorectal cancer. Because of this, we do not recommend routine use of CA19-9 in staging and surveillance of colorectal cancer patients."}

Lymph node status is a key factor for disease staging and is the main determinant for adjuvant therapy of colorectal cancer. The current staging procedure is unable to identify occult metastasis in lymph nodes, which is likely to be an important cause of treatment failure in some early-stage patients. The detection of occult metastasis could identify a patient subgroup at risk for disease relapse that would benefit from adjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study was to establish and test a multimarker reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay for the molecular detection of occult metastases in lymph nodes. Forty-four patients with colorectal cancer and 14 patients with benign bowel diseases undergoing colonic resection were enrolled in the study. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect expression of three epithelial markers, carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 20, and guanylyl cyclase C, in fresh colorectal lymph node tissue. Forty-six of 47 (97.9 percent) histologically positive lymph nodes were also positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Of 221 histologically negative nodes, 97 (43.9 percent) were positive for at least one of the three markers by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction: 24.9 percent for carcinoembryonic antigen, 16.7 percent for cytokeratin 20, and 24.9 percent for guanylyl cyclase C. Among these were 13 of 20 stage I and II cases, implying a staging shift to stage III by molecular diagnosis of occult metastasis. Fifty-nine additional nodes were found to be positive for occult metastases in 22 of 24 stage III and IV patients. These results indicate that occult metastases are detectable by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in histologically negative lymph nodes from colorectal cancer. The use of a panel of three markers improves the specificity of the method."}

Between November 1995 and June 2003, 107 patients were treated by cytoreduction and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy. The treatment was considered effective if residual tumour after cytoreduction was no thicker than 2.5 mm. The follow-up consisted of history, physical examination, serum CEA and CA 19.9 testing three-monthly, and CT-scanning of the abdomen six-monthly. Location of the recurrence was categorized into intra-abdominal, hepatic, thoracic, and both intra-abdominal and systemic. The investigation that led to the detection of a recurrence was ranked according to its invasiveness and costs. The simplest investigation that could have led to the detection was marked. A recurrence developed in 63 patients of the 74 patients effective initial treatment during the study period. Physical examination revealed the recurrence in 38 patients, at least one of the markers was raised above normal value in 39 patients and in 37 patients the CT-scan showed the recurrence. History and physical examination could have triggered the finding of a recurrence in 38 patients, tumour markers in 21 patients and CT-scanning in only three of the 74 recurrences. Physical examination and tumour marker testing detect most recurrences. CT-scanning is not an effective tool in the follow-up, and should be reserved for on-demand use."}

There are few studies reporting survival or recurrence patterns in colorectal cancer patients with inferior mesenteric lymph node metastasis (IMLN+). The present study evaluated the prognostic significance of patients being IMLN+ or IMLN- in colorectal cancer. Survival, recurrence pattern and treatment protocols were compared between 63 IMLN+ patients and 108 IMLN- patients with stage III and IV rectal and sigmoid cancer undergoing curative surgery. Lymph node sampling was routinely performed prior to inferior mesenteric artery ligation and excision flush with aorta. Limited principal node dissection including IMLN was performed in cases of identified node metastasis. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 50% in IMLN- and 31% in IMLN+ patients (P=0.004). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was greater in the N1 group than the N2 group (P=0.038). Cox regression analysis showed IMLN+, lymphovascular tumour invasion, T4, M1, and pre-operative serum CEA level over 6 ng/ml were independently associated with unfavorable disease-free survival. The prognostic significance of M category was greater when the IMLN+ was included in the M1 as opposed to the N category. In patients undergoing absolute curative surgery, post-operative recurrence rates were 34% for IMLN- and 57% for IMLN+ patients (P=0.009; OR, 2.611; 95% CI, 1.313-5.194). For IMLN+ patients, post-operative adjuvant treatment independently correlated with disease-free survival (P=0.029). IMLN+ is an independent survival factor enhancing the prognostic significance of the M category in the AJCC staging. Curative radical surgery and post-operative chemoradiotherapy appears to be warranted for IMLN+ colorectal cancer patients as it resulted in 5-year disease-free survival rates of up to 31% compared to 50% in IMLN- patients."}

Thirty per cent of patients with histologically node-negative colorectal cancer die from disseminated disease. Actually disease stage is the most useful prognostic parameter although it is not sufficient. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic cytokine involved in the progression of tumors. In our study we tried to know the prognostic significance of pre and postoperative serum VEGF levels in patients with colorectal cancer. Cohort study that included 52 patients with colorectal cancer surgically treated in our Department from 1998 to 2000. Serum VEGF and CEA levels were determined the day before surgery and 30 days after it. Preoperative serum VEGF levels (428.5 [38.5] pg/ml) were higher than in control patients (p=0.008). Serum VEGF levels fallen significantly after surgery (343 [31.2] pg/ml; p=0.001). Pre and postoperative serum VEGF levels in poorly differentiated neoplasms were higher than in well differentiated ones (p=0.009 and p=0.008 respectively).

In multivariate analysis only postoperative serum VEGF levels were associated with colorectal cancer relapse (p=0.003; HR=1.007; 95% CI, 1.002-1.012). Pre and postoperative CEA levels (p<0.001 and p=0.001 respectively) and postoperative VEGF levels (p=0.001), were associated with mortality. In multivariate analysis only tumor stage (p=0.01) and postoperative serum VEGF levels (p=0.02) were associated with mortality. Postoperative serum VEGF determination and pre and postoperative CEA levels raise specificity and positive predictive values to 100% in relation to mortality. Pre and postoperative serum VEGF determination has prognostic significance, regardless of tumor stage, in patients with colorectal cancer. In survival methods, postoperative VEGF levels >343 pg/ml are significantly with tumor relapse and mortality. These results suggest the use of serum VEGF levels as a prognostic and monitoring factor besides CEA."}

Serum CEA levels were measured monthly until the patients expired in 32 colorectal cancers after operations. CEA DT was based on semilogarithmic plots of time courses of CEA concentrations. In cases who were preoperatively CEA positive, the maximum serum CEA levels for proximal colon, distal colon and rectal cancers were 384.8+/-586.1 ng/mL, 1395.7+/-1954.6 ng/mL and 1343.4+/-1478.3 ng/mL, respectively. The maximum serum CEA level in cases of the proximal colon in preoperative CEA positive patients was lower than that in cases of distal colon or rectum. The average CEA DT on the proximal colon, distal colon and rectal cancers was 71.62+/-43.77 days, 31.07+/-15.98 days and 73.97+/-36.66 days, respectively. The CEA DT with distal colon cancers was also significantly shorter than that with proximal colon or rectal cancers (p<0.05, p<0.02). The CEA DT for lung metastasis was significantly longer than that for liver metastasis, locally or lymph node metastasis or multiple metastases (p<0.02, p<0.02, p<0.001). CEA DT serves to predict life expectancy for patients with recurrent colorectal cancers with different tumor distributions. We propose that precise measurements of serum CEA are needed so as not to overlook recurrent tumors. Detailed follow-up after operations is necessary for such patients, that CEA DT was noted in case of distal colon cancers."}

Patients with resected stage II and III CRC were randomly assigned to bolus fluorouracil/leucovorin or protracted venous infusion fluorouracil. Following completion of chemotherapy, patients were seen in clinic at regular intervals for 5 years. CEA was measured at each clinic visit, and CT of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis was performed at 12 and 24 months after commencement of chemotherapy. Between 1993 and 1999, 530 patients were recruited. The median follow-up was 5.6 years. Disease relapses were observed in 154 patients. Relapses were detected by symptoms (n = 65), CEA (n = 45), CT (n = 49), and others (n = 9). Fourteen patients, whose relapses were detected by CT, had a concomitant elevation of CEA and were included in both groups.

Clinicopathological data from 114 consecutive patients with primary stage III colorectal cancer were evaluated prospectively. Microvessel density (MVD) of the tumour was defined by counting the number of microvessels in hotspots, visualized by immunocytochemical staining of endothelial CD34. K-ras mutation was analysed by the restriction enzyme cleavage method. COX-2 expression and p53 overexpression were determined by immunocytochemistry. Increased MVD in hotspots was significantly associated with COX-2 expression (P < 0.001), K-ras mutation (P = 0.007) and p53 overexpression (P = 0.006). COX-2 expression was not associated with either K-ras mutation or p53 overexpression.

Twenty-two variables were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses to determine which factors were relevant to extrahepatic recurrence. A scoring system was developed that included the most relevant factors. The extrahepatic recurrence rate at 3 years after hepatectomy was 57.8 per cent. Three variables were independently associated with extrahepatic recurrence including raised serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen after hepatectomy (relative risk (RR) 5.4, P < 0.001), venous invasion of the primary tumour (RR 4.0, P = 0.001) and high-grade budding of the primary tumour (RR 3.1, P = 0.006).

The value of immunohistochemical detection of disseminated tumor cells in histopathologically tumor-free lymph nodes (pN0) of patients with colorectal cancer is still of uncertain prognostic value. We therefore evaluated the immunohistochemical detection rates and their prognostic value comparing three different monoclonal antibodies. A total of 170 lymph nodes of 85 patients with curatively resected colorectal carcinoma at UICC stage I or II were evaluated for disseminated tumor cells. Frozen sections of each lymph node were immunohistochemically stained using three antibodies directed against CEA, CK20, and Ber-EP4. The detection rates were compared with histopathological tumor parameters and with the patient's survival. The median follow-up time was 86 months. CEA-, CK20-, and Ber-EP4-positive disseminated tumor cells were identified microscopically in lymph nodes of 23 patients (27%), 24 patients (28%), and 23 patients (27%), respectively. In 18 patients (21%) disseminated tumor cells were found in consecutive sections and stained positive for all three monoclonal antibodies. The lymph nodes of 10 of 18 patients (56%), which developed tumor recurrence, contained CEA- and CK20-positive disseminated tumor cells. Ber-EP4-positive cells were present in lymph nodes of 9 of 18 patients (50%) with tumor recurrence. The 5-year overall survival of the 23 patients with CEA-positive disseminated tumor cells was 72% compared to 91% of the patients without immunohistochemical evidence of tumor cells (p<0.01). While the identification of CK20-positive tumor cells was also correlated significantly with a worse overall patient survival (p<0.01), the application of Ber-EP4 failed to reach significance (p=0.057). Multivariate analysis identified the tumor site (colon versus rectal cancer) (p<0.006) and the presence of CEA-positive disseminated tumor cells (p<0.03) as independent prognostic factors. In colorectal carcinoma, the immunohistochemical detection of disseminated tumor cells in histopathologically pN0 peritumoral lymph nodes allows the identification of a subgroup with a significantly worse prognosis.

Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays were used to detect and quantitate cytokeratin 20 (ck20), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) mRNA in 149 lymph nodes (LN) from 17 patients with benign disease and 302 LN from 42 patients with colorectal cancer who had curative (R0) resections. None of the markers were specific, with ck20, CEA and GCC mRNA detected in 47%, 89% and 13% of 149 LN, respectively, from patients with benign disease. The sensitivity of all 3 markers was very high, with mRNA detected in 93%, 100% and 97% of 30 histologically involved LN, respectively. There was significant overlap in the mRNA levels of all 3 markers between histologically involved and uninvolved LN. There was no association between mRNA levels and distant recurrence (median follow-up: 3.94 years, range 3.35-5.12).

A patient who has metastatic disease in the liver or lung should be considered for surgical resection if he or she is a candidate for surgery and if surgery can extend survival. Surgery should be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The panel advocates a conservative post-treatment surveillance program for colon carcinoma patients. Serial CEA determinations are appropriate if the patient is a candidate for aggressive surgical resection should recurrence be detected. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans should be used only when there are clinical indications of possible recurrence. Patients whose disease progresses during 5-FU-based therapy should be treated with bolus irinotecan.

The disease-free period was between 5 and 32 months. Nodules had a diameter <3 cm in 4 cases while in 3 cases a single lesion was present. One patient had a single lesion after 2 courses of intravenous systemic chemotherapy which had a reduced greater lesion (from 6 to 3 cm) while a 2 cm lesion had disappeared. In the remaining 12 patients the mean number of lesions is 3 (range 1-13) with a diameter between 3 and 12 cm. The radiofrequency ablation has been performed during laparotomy and vascular exclusion through clampage of the liver hilum in 4 cases and percutaneously under ultrasound guide in the remaining 15 cases. All patients underwent follow up by computed tomography, CEA level and ultrasound every 3 months. One patient only has completed a 4 year follow up and is alive without local recurrence but with a cerebral metastasis.

Although most institutions offer some kind of follow-up to patients operated on for colorectal cancer, its value with respect to prolonged survival has been challenged. However, improved results of liver surgery and chemotherapy make it reasonable to assume that a follow-up programme leading to detection of more asymptomatic recurrences would result in improved survival. Liver metastases and extramural local recurrences are the most common secondary lesions and 5-year survival rates of about 30% are reported after radical resection. From these observations a survival benefit could be expected when follow-up is directed to these forms of recurrence. From six randomized studies, six comparative cohort studies and four meta-analyses it can be concluded that an intensive follow-up programme results in more recurrences being resected for cure and about a 10% higher 5-year survival rate compared with less intensive or no follow-up. However, the differences in the follow-up protocols make it difficult to conclude how a follow-up programme should be designed. Liver imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen assay should probably be included, while the yield of frequent colonoscopies is small. A follow-up regimen based on these principles is suggested. Future studies should focus on which tests are the most cost-effective for follow-up after colorectal cancer resection."}

An overall significant good degree of agreement was observed between STM and instrumental response (p < 0.0005). The degree of agreement for each marker was as follows: excellent for CEA (p < 0.0005) and CA 125 (p = 0.006), good for CA 15.3 (p < 0.0005) and CA 19.9 (p = 0.011). Restricted analysis for the correlation of each marker with primary tumor origin showed good prediction of radiological response for CA 15.3 and CEA in breast cancer patients (p<0.0005 for both), for CEA and CA 19.9 in gastrointestinal cancer patients (p = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively), and for CEA+NSE in lung cancer patients (p = 0.01). Conversely, STM response did not correlate significantly with the clinical benefit for the patients, both in terms of PS and pain improvement (p = 0.24 and p=0.42, respectively). This study showed STMs to be good predictors of tumor response. Although STMs cannot replace diagnostic imaging, in metastatic cancer they might be useful to optimize the timing of radiological re-evaluation in the palliative setting."}

Role in diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of colon cancer patients. The circulating tumor cells of solid tumors, especially in colorectal cancer has been of great interest in medical research in the last and new century. A literature review of recent data for the preparation of a proposal for clinical applications. Starting with the detection of circulating cancer cells in histological sections, lymph nodes, bone marrow and peripheral blood have recently become the primary samples for these investigations. Following microscopic morphology, new methods were and are being developed continuously including rare cell enrichment and detection techniques like fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, RT-PCR and methylated DNA PCR. The sensitivity of these assays reaches down to the concentration of 1 tumor cell/ml blood. A lot of different epithelial markers were targeted with these techniques e.g. cytokeratins, EGFR, CEA, and EMA. Clinically, circulating tumor cells were found as independent prognostic factors in lymph nodes and bone marrow. In blood, their presence appears to be an early marker for recurrence and relapse. The change in their quantitative number is supposed to reflect the chemotherapeutic sensitivity and metastatic growth activity of the tumor. The detection of circulating tumor cells in bone marrow and lymph nodes is of clinical significance. Their presence in peripheral blood and therapeutic applications need further clarification."}

The radiofrequency ablation treatment was performed in two patients with pelvic recurrent rectal cancer with poor response to chemoradiotherapy with no indication of new surgical treatment and suffering strong pain in the sacrum area. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen had a sharp reduction in a sixty-day period. The post-procedure tomography analysis showed the center of the tumor with necrosis and a ring of edema around it. Both patients had no complaints about the procedure, and they needed to take mild analgesics only on the first day right after the procedure for pain. In the follow-up one patient developed an abscess and needed to be readmitted but without recurrent pelvic pain. An effective response was shown by tumor necrosis and total relief of pain of the sacrum area."}

Targeted systemic radiation therapy using radiolabeled antibodies results in tumor doses sufficient to produce significant objective responses in the radiosensitive hematological malignancies. Although comparable doses to tumor are achieved with radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in solid tumors, results have been modest primarily because of their relative lack of radiosensitivity. For solid tumors, as with external beam radiotherapy, RIT should have a more important clinical role if combined with other systemic, potentially radiation-enhancing chemotherapy agents and if used as consolidative therapy in the minimal tumor burden setting. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of systemic 90Y-chimeric T84.66 (cT84.66) anti-carcinoembryonic antigen RIT in combination with continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer were entered. The study was designed for each patient to receive 90Y-cT84.66 anti-carcinoembryonic antigen at 16.6 mCi/m2 as an i.v. bolus infusion combined with 5-FU delivered as a 5-day continuous infusion initiated 4 h before antibody infusion. Cohorts of patients were entered at 5-FU dose levels of 700, 800, 900, and 1000 mg/m2/day. Upon reaching the highest planned dose level of 5-FU, a final cohort received 90Y-cT84.66 at 20.6 mCi/m2 and 5-FU at 1000 mg/m2/day. For all patients, Ca-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid at 125 mg/m2 every 12 h was administered for the first 72 h after 90Y-cT84.66. Patients were eligible to receive up to three cycles of 90Y-cT84.66/5-FU every 6 weeks. Twenty-one patients were treated on this study. All had been heavily pretreated with 19 having previously received 5-FU and 16 having failed two to four chemotherapy regimens. A maximum-tolerated dose of 16.6 mCi/m2 90Y-cT84.66 combined with 1000 mg/m2/day 5-FU was reached. These dose levels are comparable with maximum-tolerated dose levels of each agent alone. Thirteen patients received one cycle and 8 patients two cycles of therapy. Hematopoietic toxicity was dose-limiting and reversible. RIT did not appear to increase nonhematopoietic toxicities associated with 5-FU. Two of 19 patients assayed developed a human anti-chimeric antibody immune response after the first cycle of therapy, which is significantly less than that observed in a previous trial evaluating 90Y-cT84.66 alone. No objective responses were observed. However, 11 patients with progressive disease entering the study demonstrated radiological stable disease of 3-8 months duration and 1 patient demonstrated a mixed response. Results from this trial are encouraging and demonstrate the feasibility and possible advantages of combining continuous infusion 5-FU with 90Y-cT84.66 RIT. The addition of 5-FU does not appear to significantly enhance hematological toxicities of the radiolabeled antibody. In addition, 5-FU reduces the development of human anti-chimeric antibody response, permitting multicycle therapy in a larger number of patients. Future efforts should continue to focus on integrating radiation therapy delivered by radiolabeled antibodies into established 5-FU regimens."}

The clinical value of carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid in the draining venous blood has been controversial because of short observation period. The authors prospectively investigated the clinical significance of detection of carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid in the draining venous blood to predict hepatic metastases in patients with resectable colorectal cancer. Drainage venous blood from 80 patients who underwent curative resections for colorectal cancer were obtained immediately before surgery to determine the presence of cancer cells by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. After an average follow-up period of 52.1 months, 7 of the 35 patients (20 percent) with positive carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid had hepatic metastases, whereas 2 of the 45 patients (4.5 percent) with negative carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid had hepatic metastases. The cumulative probability of hepatic metastatic recurrence rate differed significantly between two patient groups with positive or negative carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid expression in the drainage vein (log-rank, 4.900; P = 0.0269). However, 28 of the 35 patients (80 percent) with positive carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid did not have hepatic metastases. Additionally, Cox proportional hazards models identified the presence of lymph node metastases as the only independent predictor of hepatic metastatic recurrence. This study failed to demonstrate the high predictive value of carcinoembryonic antigen messenger ribonucleic acid detection in the draining venous blood for the development of hepatic metastases.

Forty-nine patients who underwent resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer were reviewed. The factors assessed were age, sex, pathological findings of the original colorectal cancer (depth, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, lymph node metastasis, differentiation, Dukes' stage) and pulmonary metastasis (maximum tumour size, number of tumours, completeness of resection), serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, previous hepatectomy for liver metastases, and surgical procedure for resection of pulmonary metastasis. Overall survival and intrapulmonary recurrence were also reviewed. Survival rates after resection of pulmonary metastases were 78 per cent at 3 years and 56 per cent at 5 years. Solitary pulmonary metastases were significantly correlated with survival (P = 0.049). The pathological features of the primary colorectal cancer had no impact on survival. Histologically incomplete resection of pulmonary metastasis significantly correlated with pulmonary re-recurrence (P = 0.034). Long-term survival can be expected after complete resection of pulmonary metastases arising from colorectal cancer, especially in patients with a solitary pulmonary metastasis."}

Metastases to the liver occur in greater than 50% of patients and remain the biggest determinant of outcome in these patients. Liver resection is a safe procedure that achieves good long-term survival, but surgery has traditionally been limited to select groups of patients. The improved outcome suggests that more patients could benefit from resection if more was known of what criteria are predictive of a good outcome. A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients undergoing surgical resection of the liver for colorectal metastases between March 1989 and March 2001 in the Birmingham Liver Unit. During this period, 212 liver resections for colorectal cancer metastases were performed in 82 females and 130 males. The median follow-up was 16 months with an overall actuarial survival of 86% at 1 year, 54% at 3 years, and 28% at 5 years. The peri-operative mortality was 2.8%. The number and timing (metachronous or synchronous) of metastatic lesions, the gender of the patient, pathological staging of the primary lesion or surgical resection margins had no significant influence on survival. Patients with lesions less than 5 cm in size had a significantly prolonged survival compared with patients with lesions greater than 5 cm in size (P < 0.004). Liver resection is the only curative treatment for patients with colorectal metastases. The long-term survival reported in patients with resected colorectal metastases confined to the liver is comparable to primary surgery for solid gastrointestinal tumours. Every attempt must be made to increase the availability of liver resection to patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer."}

Our porpuse is to evaluate the prognostic significance of preoperative serum and inmunohistochemical levels of cathepsin B to identify colorectal carcinomas with worse prognostic. Fifty five patients undergoing surgical treatment for colorectal cancer from 1998 to 2000. As a control group sera from 23 patients with acute appendicitis. Serum levels of cathepsin B were obtained preoperatively (KRKA, Novo Slovenia;ng/ml); cathepsin B inmunoreactivity was determinated after surgical treatment, (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Serum levels of CEA (Inmulit 2000 CEA), and CA 19,9 (Inmulite Gi-Ma, Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA), and p53 expression (Dako) were determinated in patients with colorectal cancer. Survival analysis was realized using Cox and Kaplan-Meier methods (SPSS 10.0 for Windows). The mean age of patients with colorectal cancer was 68 years (range 39-87 years). 29 males and 26 females. Tumor size was 4.6 cms., range 1-12. Rectal localization, 32.2%. Moderately differentiated, 49.1%. The median serum and inmunohistochemical levels of cathepsin B were 5.74 ng/ml and 29.56% in patients with acute appendicitis respectively.

The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of supervised low-resolution image analysis of immunohistochemically stained sections as alternative. Multiple sections (n = 50) of regional lymph nodes from patients with colorectal cancer were immunohistochemically stained and analyzed by applying low-resolution image analysis (flatbed scanning) for semiautomated detection of cytokeratin (CK)-positive stained cells. The sensitivity of this approach was demonstrated for 20 patients with stage II colorectal cancer and compared with RT-PCR regarding the detection of clinically assessed recurrence of disease within 10 years. CK(+) cells were detected in all of the patients (n = 6; 100%) with recurrence, compared with five patients (83%) found positive by carcinoembryonic antigen RT-PCR. From patients (n = 14) who did not develop a recurrence, eight (57%) had positive lymph nodes. In all patients with recurrence, we visually identified at least one group of CK(+) cells (>/==\" BORDER=\"0\">2 cells). Automated image analysis is a promising tool for the detection of occult cells in histopathologically negative nodes. It is potentially more sensitive but less specific for detecting recurrence of disease than conventional histopathology or RT-PCR and is particularly useful for the evaluation of sentinel nodes. Furthermore, it opens new ways for basic research of occult cells based on molecular profiling after laser-microdissection."}

Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, histopathologic and operative data of 112 patients who had resection for colorectal cancer, were analyzed for their effect on survival. Eight variables (invasion depth of tumor, nodal status, presence of metastasis, CEA level, differentiation, resectability, tumor location, presence of blood transfusion), which have the most significant effect on survival in univariate analysis and multivariate analysis, were chosen. Coefficients were calculated and the Prognostic Score for Colorectal Cancer (PSCRC) was designed. All patients were scored using this system and staged according to TNM, Dukes and Astler-Coller systems. The score range is between -49 and 80. Patients were grouped as Group 1 (score < -30), Group 2 (score -30 to -6), Group 3 (score -5 to 19), Group 4 (score > 19). Survival rates decreased and recurrence rates increased significantly with increasing scores. The associations of PSCRC and staging systems with survival and recurrence rates were determined by logistic and Cox regression analyses. PSCRC was proved to have the most significant association with survival and recurrence rates. Furthermore, PSCRC had better correlation with survival and recurrence rates when compared with staging systems according to Pearson correlation analysis. Inclusion of more variables in PSCRC seems to make it superior to the staging systems. PSCRC may be a practical and useful scoring system in clinical practice and is easily adapted to different patient populations."}

Cancer-specific immunotherapy holds great promise as an emerging treatment for advanced colorectal cancer and may be combined with standard chemotherapy to provide a synergistic inhibitory action against tumor cells. To examine the interrelationship between the immune system and chemotherapy, we studied the induction of both CEA, a tumor-associated antigen, and MHC class I, a major component of the antigen presenting system, in response to a number of chemotherapeutic agents. The effect of a selection of standard chemotherapeutics on MHC class I and CEA expression in human colorectal cancer cell lines was determined by flow cytometry and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, studies using mice bearing tumors derived from an injected murine colon cancer cell line were performed to determine if alteration in MHC class I expression occurs in vivo following continuous infusion of chemotherapeutic agents into the peritoneal cavity, as well as to facilitate correlations between expression of this factor and therapeutic effectiveness. All anti-cancer drugs examined, when given at IC50 values, induced expression of MHC class I protein in the human colon cancer cell line, COLO201. However, expression of CEA mRNA was only induced upon exposure to 5-FU, in contrast to obscure induction following CDDP and SN-38 treatment. Combined treatment with 5-FU and CDDP gave additional effect on CEA expression in COLO201 cells. Regarding the in vivo studies in mice, the size of the murine colon cancer cell-derived tumors was reduced only in response to treatment with CDDP, which also mediated the highest induction of MHC class I expression. These results suggest that chemotherapeutic agents trigger the immune system and cancer-specific immunotherapy may be effective when used in combination with systemic chemotherapy."}

Of a series of 134 patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas 90 underwent radical surgery and 44 palliative surgery. The control group consisted of 22 organ donors. The cutoff serum levels utilized were 5 ng/mL for CEA and 20 U/mL for CA 242. The mortality during follow-up was recorded in order to determine the duration of survival. The data were submitted to statistical analysis using diagnostic tests, the chi-square test, survival analysis (Kaplan and Meier) and ROC curves. A significance level of p < or = 0.05 was applied. The sensitivity of CEA in Dukes' stages A, B, C and D was 27.8%, 32.4%, 32.1% and 66.7%, respectively. The sensitivity of CA 242 was 11.1%, 16.2%, 30.8% and 50%.

The five-year survival rate for those treated by hepatectomy was significantly higher (32.9 percent) than for those not undergoing hepatectomy (3.4 percent). After hepatectomy for hepatic metastasis, the most prevalent form of recurrence was in the remnant liver (41.4 percent), followed by recurrence of pulmonary metastasis (19.2 percent), and other (7.2 percent). Factors of the primary tumor adversely affecting prognosis after hepatectomy for hepatic metastasis included poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or mucinous carcinoma, depth of invasion of si/ai, lymph-node metastasis of Stage n3 and n4 by the Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma, number of metastatic lymph nodes of more than four, and Dukes Stage D. Factors at the time of hepatectomy adversely affecting prognosis after surgery for hepatic metastasis included residual tumor, extrahepatic metastasis, hepatic metastasis of degree H3 stipulated by the Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma, number of metastases of four or more, pathology of hepatic metastasis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, resection margin of <10 mm, and carcinoembryonic antigen value higher than normal preoperative and one month postoperative. Among therapies for hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer, the present study clearly revealed that hepatectomy is the treatment of choice whenever feasible.

Twenty-one patients underwent palliative surgery for malignant bowel obstruction due to peritoneal dissemination from colorectal cancer. In all cases, the advanced and nonresectable nature of the tumor was confirmed at laparotomy. Clinical factors such as age, gender, serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen, amount of ascites, location of the primary cancer, surgical procedure, and postoperative chemotherapy were analyzed for prognostic significance in symptom-free and overall survival using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and the log-rank test.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the presence of disseminated tumour cells in blood and bone marrow could predict extrahepatic tumour recurrence. Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to study the presence of tumour cells in preoperative peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from 41 patients with liver metastasis scheduled for surgical resection. CK20 expression was detected in six of 41 peripheral blood samples and in eight of 32 bone marrow samples. There was no correlation between CK20-positive samples and subsequent extrahepatic recurrence.

The results strongly suggest that the presence of circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood may reflect transient shedding of tumour cells related to large tumour volume."}

The immunizations were well tolerated. Of the 24 evaluable patients in the dose-escalation phase, there was 1 complete response (by tumor marker), 2 minor responses, 3 with stable disease, and 18 with progressive disease. In the phase II study, 9 of 13 patients have relapsed at a median of 122 days. Evidence of an immunologic response was demonstrated in biopsies of DC injection sites and peripheral blood of selected patients. We conclude that it is feasible and safe to administer mRNA-loaded DC to patients with advanced malignancies."}

Several investigators have analyzed prognostic factors of surgical treatment for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer, but the results remain inconclusive. This study was performed to determine the prognostic implications of the prethoracotomy serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in relation to the postthoracotomy recurrent pattern among patients with this disease. A retrospective analysis of prognostic factors was undertaken in 100 patients who had consecutively undergone initial surgical resection for pulmonary metastases of colorectal origin. The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates were 62.2% and 49.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that the prethoracotomy serum CEA level and operative curability were strongly associated with prognosis, while in multivariate analysis, only the prethoracotomy serum CEA level was a significant prognostic indicator. Patients with a high level of prethoracotomy serum CEA more frequently exhibited recurrence in extrathoracic sites, especially in the brain. Before thoracotomy for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer, the serum CEA level was the most useful prognostic factor. Patients with elevated serum CEA level should undergo a careful prethoracotomy systemic survey and postthoracotomy follow-up for extrathoracic metastases, in particular brain metastases, and an appropriate combined therapeutic modality should be considered."}

The goal of any surveillance program should be detection of recurrent disease at a sufficiently early time to allow subsequent curative therapy. Although periodic clinical examinations, laboratory tests, radiographic imaging, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing have been utilized as a form of surveillance, such aggressive and costly intervention has not been validated through clinical studies. Four of the five randomized trials comparing such an intensive surveillance strategy to less frequent testing have not demonstrated the intensive approach to lead to an improvement in overall survival. Furthermore, intensive testing is both costly and has been shown not to improve quality of life. Further research designing appropriate postoperative testing is needed to guide physicians and patients after the curative resection of a colorectal cancer."}

To evaluate the usefulness of immunoscintigraphy with an anti-CEA monoclonal antibody fragment labelled with (99m)Tc for early detection of colorectal recurrence in patients with rising serum CEA levels. Fifty-one consecutive patients (27 women, 24 men) with colorectal cancer (mean age 68.9+/-10.2 years) and rising CEA levels (16.2+/-18.2 ng/ml) were prospectively studied. Two immunoscintigraphy studies were performed in 8 patients (n=59). Immunoscintigraphy was performed after i.v. injection of 925 MBq of anti-CEA monoclonal antibody. Planar images of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis, as well as SPECT of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained at 4 and 24 hours after injection. In all cases an abdominal CT scan was previously performed. Findings were validated by histopathological analysis (28 cases) or by imaging and clinical follow-up of at least 6 months following the immunoscintigraphy (31 cases). Forty-one patients did not show recurrence during follow-up. We found 18 cases with confirmed diagnosis of extrahepatic abdominal or pelvic diseases, 11 cases with liver metastases, 9 in the thorax and 2 in the bone. In patients with pelvic and extrahepatic abdominal disease, immunoscintigraphy was positive in 18 cases (14 true positive, 4 false positive). From the 14 true positive only 7 cases had been detected by CT. Immunoscintigraphy was negative in the remaining 41 cases (37 true negative, 4 false negative). Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity for immunoscintigraphy in extrahepatic abdominal and pelvic disease were 78% and 90%, respectively. CT results showed a lower sensitivity of 61% (p<0.05) and specificity of 83%. Liver metastases were detected by CT in 9 cases, but only 2 of these were identified using immunoscintigraphy. Scintigraphy with anti-CEA monoclonal antibody fragment labelled with (99m)Tc is superior to CT for the detection of pelvic and extrahepatic abdominal recurrence of colorectal cancer, while CT is more sensitive in the detection of liver and lung metastases. Immunoscintigraphy has a limited usefulness in the detection of distant metastases, but it may be helpful in the diagnosis of suspected colorectal recurrence in patients with non-conclusive CT findings, when FDG-PET is not available."}

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of this marker as a diagnostic test for these parameters of colorectal cancer. In a sample of 283 patients operated on for colorectal carcinoma data were retrospectively recorded corresponding to preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen, type of surgery performed (curative vs. non-curative), tumor intramural spread, lymph node involvement, distant metastasis, TNM stage, tumoral differentiation, survival time and survival time free of disease. Bivariate analysis between carcinoembryonic antigen and the rest of the parameters was performed. Also, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy (efficiency) of the marker considered as a diagnostic test, were analyzed in relation to the tumoral resectability and tumoral spread. Preoperative level of serum carcinoembryonic antigen was statistically significantly associated with type of surgery performed (p < 0.001); tumoral intramural spread (p = 0.001); lymph node involvement (p < 0.001); presence of distant metastasis (p < 0.001); TNM staging (p < 0.001); overall survival period (p < 0.001) and disease-free survival time (p = 0.04). There was no relation between carcinoembryonic antigen and the degree of tumoral differentiation. The carcinoembryonic antigen's greatest sensitivity corresponded with the prediction for the type of the surgery performed and with the existence of distant metastasis, 80% and 70.9%, respectively. The negative predictive value was also high (> 90% in both cases). When considering the intramural spread, the specificity was 82% and its positive predictive value 93.1%.

A total of 36 patients were included. Median age was 53 years (range, 33-72). One treatment cycle consisted of irinotecan, 100 mg/m2 weekly, for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest. Gender, age, primary site, number of metastatic sites, histologic subtype, differentiation, pretreatment CEA, CA 19-9 and lactate dehydrogenase levels and marker response to treatment were investigated as predictive factors for response to treatment and as prognostic factors in the overall survival and time to progression of the patients. A total of 120 cycles (median, 3 cycles) was delivered. An overall 14% objective response rate (1 complete and 4 partial responses) was achieved. The median response duration was 4 months (range, 2-7). Another 36% of the patients had stable disease for a median duration of 4 months (range, 2-8). Median time-to-disease progression was 4 months and overall median survival was 12 months (95% confidence interval, 9-15). Pretreatment serum CA 19-9 level and marker response to two courses of treatment were found to be clinically significant in time to progression and overall survival. Younger age (< or = 45 years) was a poor prognostic factor associated with a shorter time to progression. The major toxicity was grade 3-4 diarrhea, which occurred in 28% of the patients, and treatment was discontinued in 3 (8%) patients due to toxicity. Other hematological and non-hematological toxicities were mild and manageable.

For 22 patients who underwent repeat hepatectomy, no mortality and an 18% morbidity rate were observed. The 3-year survival rate after repeat hepatectomy was 49%. The only poor prognostic factor after repeat hepatectomy was a serum carcinoembryonic antigen level greater than 50 ng/mL before initial hepatectomy. The prognosis for patients who underwent repeat hepatectomy and had shown high carcinoembryonic antigen levels before initial hepatectomy was approximately equal to that for the patients who received systemic chemotherapy or hepatic arterial infusion for unresectable tumors in the remnant liver. Repeat hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases can be performed safely and appears to be as effective as initial hepatectomy.

Not only are carcinoembryonic antigens expressed by the corresponding tumor cell, but the messenger ribonucleic acid of tumor-associated antigens, in contrast, is produced exclusively by viable tumor cells. L6 messenger ribonucleic acid was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Carcinoembryonic antigen was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, with a cutoff value of 40 microg/l. Blood serum was sampled from 187 patients with colorectal cancer. Statistical significance was calculated with the McNemar chi-squared test. Preoperatively, 79 percent of patients in all stages were positive for L6 messenger ribonucleic acid, whereas only 35 percent had elevated carcinoembryonic antigen titers (P < 0.001). In Dukes A tumors, 84.9 percent of patients were positive for L6 messenger ribonucleic acid, whereas carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated in only 16.9 percent of patients. Only in Dukes D tumors did the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for carcinoembryonic antigen exhibit the same sensitivity as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for L6 messenger ribonucleic acid. Recurrence was detected significantly earlier by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for L6 messenger ribonucleic acid than by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for carcinoembryonic antigen.

Three meta-analysis have shown that intensive follow-up can improve survival, the most recent based on five previously published small controlled trials that compared intensive with control follow-up. Since the randomised studies were initiated, there have been a strong development of rectal cancer surgery and surgery for livermetastasis as well as for adjuvant and palliative oncologic treatments.

{"id": "12738742", "title": "Vaccine therapy of established tumors in the absence of autoimmunity.", "content": "Vaccine therapy of established tumors in the absence of autoimmunity. Many current clinical trials involve vaccination of patients with vaccines directed against tumor-associated antigens, which are, in actuality, \"self-antigens\" overexpressed in tumors as compared with normal tissues. As tumor vaccines become more potent through the addition of costimulatory molecules and cytokines and the use of diversified prime and boost regimes, the level of concern rises regarding the balance between antitumor immunity and pathological autoimmunity. Studies were conducted using mice bearing a transgenic self-antigen [human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)], which is expressed in some normal adult tissues, and tumor expressing the same self-antigen. These mice were vaccinated with recombinant poxviral vectors [recombinant vaccinia, recombinant fowlpox (rF)] encoding the CEA transgene as well as a triad of costimulatory molecules [B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3 (TRICOM)]. Here we investigate the mechanism of tumor therapy and evaluate the safety of such a regimen in a self-antigen system. To our knowledge, the study reported here is the first description of a vaccine to a defined antigen where the regimen is potent enough to induce tumor therapy in the absence of autoimmunity. CEA transgenic mice were transplanted with CEA-expressing tumors. Fourteen days later, mice were vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia-CEA/TRICOM admixed with recombinant murine granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and then given low-dose interleukin 2. Mice were boosted on days 21, 28, and 35 with rF-CEA/TRICOM admixed with rF-granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and then given low-dose interleukin 2. Mice were monitored for survival and compared with groups of mice vaccinated in a similar manner with poxviral vectors containing CEA/B7-1 or CEA transgenes. To determine the mechanism of antitumor therapy, mice were depleted of T-cell subpopulations before vaccination with the CEA/TRICOM regimen. Mice successfully cured of tumor and age-matched control mice were monitored for 1 year. At 1 year, several clinical assays were carried out involving analysis of 9 serological parameters, 11 urinalysis parameters, and 14 immunological parameters. In addition, histopathology was performed on 42 tissues/mouse. The CEA/TRICOM vaccination regimen induced a therapeutic antitumor response as measured by increased survival, which was due largely to induced T-cell responses (both CD4(+) and CD8(+)) as determined by selective T-cell subset depletion. The CEA/TRICOM vaccination regimen induced a significant increase in proliferation of CD4(+) T cells to CEA protein and a significant increase in secretion of IFN-gamma from CD8(+) T cells in response to a defined CEA epitope. Despite CEA expression in normal adult gastrointestinal tissues, no toxicity was observed in the CEA/TRICOM-vaccinated group when an array of clinical serum and urine chemistry assays was conducted 1 year after vaccination. Moreover, a comprehensive histopathological evaluation of all tissues from these groups also showed no evidence of toxicity. Activation of T cells directed against a tumor-associated self-antigen, sufficient to mediate therapeutic antitumor immunity, was observed in vivo without the development of autoimmunity as analyzed by a comprehensive evaluation of biochemical, immunological, and histopathological criteria. These studies demonstrate that the use of vectors containing as many as three costimulatory molecules does not induce autoimmunity or other pathology. These studies thus demonstrate that a balance can indeed be achieved between the induction of an immune response to a self-antigen, which is capable of antitumor therapy, and the absence of autoimmunity."}

The aim of this study was to determine the significance of negative initial CEA values in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Initial CEA values were determined in 114 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The patients were divided into three groups according to these values: I (n=22) <5 ng/mL; II (n=33) 5-100 ng/mL; III (n=59) >100 ng/mL. Seven/114 complete responses (CR), 22/114 partial responses (PR), 45/114 instances of stable disease (SD) and 38/114 of progressive disease (PD) were registered, while two patients were not evaluable.

The mean initial CEA values in the different response categories were: CR: 4.0 ng/mL; PR: 436 ng/mL; SD: 1442 ng/mL; PD: 6071 ng/mL. The likelihood of response, in particular CR, was highly dependent upon CEA levels (Fisher's exact test, 0.00001). The median survival decreased significantly with increased values of CEA (p=0.006).

A prospective study was performed that included 132 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery with curative intent and who were followed up for a minimum of 5 years. Serum samples were obtained the first two years after surgery. Marker serum levels were analyzed with the commercial Delfia test kit. During the sampling period, carcinoembryonic antigen levels were very high or above the individual cutoff level in 21 of 24 cases with recurrent disease. All eight hepatic metastases detected during the sampling period were indicated by carcinoembryonic antigen 0 to 19 months earlier. In the 3rd postoperative year, nine patients with recurrence were identified, and in eight of them, carcinoembryonic antigen rose above the individual cutoff level 23 months before diagnosis. The overall sensitivity and specificity associated with recurrent disease with individual cutoff levels were 79 and 64 percent for carcinoembryonic antigen, 46 and 77 percent for CA 50, and 63 and 76 percent for CA 242, respectively, which was higher than for any other method compared. With individual cutoff levels, both carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 242 had high sensitivity and acceptable specificity for indicating recurrent colorectal cancer. Because most (29/33) patients with recurrent disease identified within 3 years after surgery and all 8 with hepatic metastases identified during the sampling period were indicated by carcinoembryonic antigen with the individual cutoff, that method was established as the best for postoperative surveillance."}

Since then, surgical resection of pulmonary metastases has been generally accepted as a standard therapeutic procedure in properly selected cases. Recently, the criteria of eligibility have been progressively expanded according to the development of radiological diagnosis using helical computed tomography (CT), widespread of minimum invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery. In this review summarized the surgical treatment of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer based on the recent literatures. Major areas of controversy remain with respect to the following aspects: prognostic factors (i.e., number of metastases, size of tumor, disease free interval, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level), procedure of operation (i.e., role of video-assisted thoracic surgery, lymphonode dissection), indication of surgical treatment on metastases both lung and liver, role of repeat thoracotomy for recurrence. For all above-mentioned points it appeared reasonable to try to the cooperative multicentric clinical prospective study."}

The optimal follow-up strategy for colorectal cancer is unknown. We surveyed all Canadian radiation oncologists, medical oncologists and surgeons specializing in colorectal cancer to assess their recommendations for follow-up after potentially curative treatment, the beliefs and attitudes underlying these practices, and the cost implications of different follow-up strategies. One hundred and sixty practitioners (58%) returned completed surveys. Most recommended clinical assessments every 3-4 months in the first 2 years including carcino-embryonic antigen testing, gradually decreasing in frequency over 5 years. Ninety per cent recommend a surveillance colonoscopy in the first year. The majority felt that specialist involvement in follow-up was important because of the increased opportunities for patients to contribute to research (76%) and teaching (73%). About half felt that specialists were more efficient at providing follow-up than primary care physicians, but these same physicians recommended significantly longer and more expensive follow-up routines on average than others. Primary care physicians were felt to be important allies, especially in managing the psychosocial concerns of patients. Surveillance practices are generally in keeping with published recommendations. Most specialists feel that they should remain involved in follow-up, but this may result in increased resource utilization."}

Mutant tumour derived DNA has been detected in the sera of colorectal cancer patients. We investigated if mutant serum KRAS2 was detectable preoperatively in a large group of patients with colorectal neoplasia. A prospective study of 94 patients who underwent putative curative resection for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) was performed to ascertain if serum mutant KRAS2 could be used postoperatively as a disease marker. Preoperative sera from 78 patients were analysed (group A). Sera from 94 patients were obtained three monthly for up to three years during the postoperative period (group B). Codon 12 and 13 KRAS2 mutations were analysed in matched tumour and serum samples. In the preoperative group (group A), KRAS2 mutation was found in 41/78 (53%) tumours and in 32/78 (41%) preoperative sera. Of 41 tumour KRAS2 mutation positive cases, 31/41 (76%) had an identical serum mutation detectable. In group B, the postoperative follow up group, 60/94 cases were primary tumour KRAS2 mutation positive. Of these 60, 16/60 (27%) became persistently serum mutant KRAS2 positive postoperatively. Ten of 16 (63%) of these developed a recurrence compared with only 1/44 (2%) patients who remained serum mutant negative (odds ratio 71.7 (95% confidence interval 7.7-663.9; p=0.0000). None of 34 tumour mutation negative cases became serum mutant KRAS2 positive postoperatively, despite recurrence in 9/34 patients. The relative hazard of disease recurrence in postoperative serum mutant KRAS2 positive patients was 6.37 (2.26-18.0; p=0.000). Serum mutant KRAS2 can be detected preoperatively in all stages of colorectal neoplasia. Postoperatively, serum mutant KRAS2 is a strong predictor of disease recurrence, stronger even than Dukes' stage of disease, and thus shows potential for use in clinical practice as a marker of preclinical disease recurrence."}

The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of the preoperative serum alpha-L-fucosidase (AFU) activity in colorectal cancer and to assess whether it could add prognostic information that Dukes' stages do not give. A postoperative follow-up of 137 colorectal cancer patients was performed, and survival analyses were carried out to evaluate the impact of AFU activity on disease-free survival. Dukes' stage classification, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels and six other clinicopathological features of the patients were also analysed. In previous studies, we have stressed the diagnostic value of AFU activity in preoperatively obtained serum from colorectal cancer patients. In the present work, we have found that the enzymatic activity of serum AFU was not related to the Dukes' stage of the primary tumour, but it was associated with the type of metastasis and recurrence of the disease. The mean value of preoperative serum AFU activity was higher in patients with distant metastases than in those with lymph node or peritoneal metastases, or without metastasis (p = 0.034). After a mean postoperative follow-up period of 22 months, three groups of patients with different recurrence rates could be distinguished (p = 0.0014). Similar results were found when only patients in Dukes' stage B (p = 0.0439) or C (p = 0.0122) were considered. According to our findings, serum AFU activity appears to be a good prognostic factor of tumour recurrence in colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, patients in Dukes' stage B or C at high or very high risk of tumour recurrence could be spotted."}

Peritoneal recurrence after curative resection of malignant tumor with negative cytology is considered to be caused by microscopic dissemination of the exfoliated cancer cells from primary tumors to serosal surfaces at the time of operation, not detectable with conventional diagnostic tools. We applied the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 20 (CK 20) to detect micrometastatic foci in the peritoneal cavity of colon cancer patients. Cytological samples taken by peritoneal lavage from a series of 79 colon cancer patients were analyzed microscopically, for CEA levels, and by RT-PCR analysis using nested primers for CEA and CK 20. Cases with both CEA and CK 20 signals were defined as PCR-positive. This RT-PCR method proved both sensitive (1 tumor cell/10(6) non-tumor cells on preparation of serial colorectal cancer cell dilutions) and specific (no false positive results, 0/23 tested in our control experiment). Intraperitoneal micrometastatic cells were detected in peritoneal lavage 7.6% by cytology, 17.7% by CEA levels, and 24.1% by RT-PCR (significantly higher than by cytology: p=0.0046). RT-PCR detection rate increased in parallel with pathological depth of tumor invasion, and also a pathological stage-dependence was suggested according to the tumor-node-metastasis classification of the International Union Against Cancer. Our results suggest that CEA and CK 20 mRNA identification by RT-PCR appeared to be reliable and may be useful for early diagnosis in peritoneal dissemination of colon cancer."}

Biochemical modulation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been verified the evidence of significant improvement of survival and quality of life in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma. We investigated the therapeutic and adverse drug reaction of intensive chemotherapy using cisplatin (CDDP), 5-FU and dl-leucovorin (LV) (PFL-therapy), which may be producing dual biochemical modulation effect of 5-FU for advanced colorectal carcinoma. Administration schedule was 13 mg/m2 of CDDP, 300 mg/m2 of 5-FU, and 30 mg/body of dl-LV for 5 consecutive days. This regimen was repeated at 3-week intervals in hospital. Sixteen patients were enrolled in this study, most of whom had a history of previous chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment, and the response rate was 25%, with four patients having \"partial response\" and eight \"no change\". In respect to performance status, 46% of patients who completed the protocol were markedly improved in spite of their poor performance status before treatment. Moreover, when patients were classified into two groups based on changes of the serum level of CEA, \"responder in CEA level\" showed better prognosis than \"non-responder in CEA level\". Major toxicities were nausea, hyperglycemia and neutropenia. Three patients experienced Grade 4 hematological side effect, but these complications resolved quickly in all patients except for one patient. PFL-therapy is effective for advanced colorectal cancer with large tumor burden and showed the same prognostic result as the American and European trials in spite of smaller number of treatment cycles and a history of previous chemotherapy. We will be able to demonstrate the usefulness of this regimen for Japanese patients with advanced colorectal cancers after adding new cases to the present report."}

The aim of this study was to develop a murine model of human colon carcinoma (hCC) and to ascertain the potential of cellular immunotherapy in this model. Fragments of hCC obtained at surgery from 6 patients were transplanted under the kidney capsule of lethally irradiated CB6 mice radioprotected with severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bone marrow. Tumor xenografts conserved their malignant behavior in the new environment, invading the mouse kidney parenchyma and expanding into the peritoneal cavity and adjacent tissues. Their growth was typically exponential, and they expanded to dimensions that allowed their subsequent fragmentation and passage to further preconditioned mice. Human carcinoembryonic antigen (hCEA) was detected on the implanted tumor and at occasionally spontaneous lung metastases. Most significantly, high levels of this tumor marker were detected in the sera of tumor-bearing mice, providing a useful tool, which allowed long-term experiments, monitoring of tumor progression, and its response to some treatment modalities. For instance, complete resection of the transplanted tumors, by means of nephrectomy, resulted in the disappearance of hCEA from mice sera within 2 weeks. Similarly, adoptive transfer of allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) into the peritoneum of tumor-bearing mice, resulted in their rapid engraftment, infiltration of tumor mass, and a significant drop of hCEA levels in mice serum, accounting for inhibition of tumor growth. We suggest that this novel model of human colon carcinoma affords the opportunity for in vivo evaluation of different preclinical treatment modalities, particularly, those involving manipulation with immune effector cells."}

Relapses have an important meaning in relation to the curative surgical intervention. In RO resections according to UICC classification, the local relapses were classified as the most important factor for survival. Without any doubts the most important of these tumor-biological prognostic factors in patients with colorectal carcinoma is the carcino-embryonal antigen. Up to now, the unquestionable importance of the determination of serum levels of CEA for the detection of relapses is most often described. This study is retrospective, not randomized. Analyzed were medical records and data of patients, who underwent the surgery of colorectal carcinoma at IInd Department of Surgery, University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Bratislava, in period from January 1st, 1986 to December 31st, 1995. In our analysis we evaluate the age and gender of patients, date of the surgery and type of the surgery from the point of acuteness, as well as radicality, staging of the disease, levels of the serum CEA. Serum levels of carcino-embryonal antigen before operation were determined and evaluated. In patients, who remaind in the monitoring at our department we examine CEA in regular intervals. From our group of patients, in 28 patients the relapse of the disease was determined here. Before the first operation, the preoperative level of CEA was examined in 15 patients and in 13 patients it was not. From 15 patients with examined CEA level, 7 patients (46.7%) had increased and 9 patients (53.3%) normal level. In twenty-seven patients CEA level was examined to reveal a relapse. One patient was diagnosed during the acute surgery and CEA was not determined prior this operation. From the remaining 27 patients, CEA level was positive in 20 patients (74.1%) and 7 patients had normal levels (25.9%). From these 7 patients with normal CEA level, in 5 cases it was locoregional relapse and 2 patients have distant metastases. From all patients, in whom the relapse was determined at our department, in 13 patients locoregional relapse was detected and in 15 patients distant metastases were diagnosed. Due to the sensitivity of serum level of CEA for detection of relapses, which is higher compared to the primary tumor and also to found lead time 4 months we think the postoperative regular determination of CEA in patients after the curative resection is appropriate. Earlier determination of less progressive relapse is definitely important, although the current long-term survival after the surgery for relapses is not optimistic. Development of surgical procedures as well as alternative treatment can bring better results in less developed relapse of the disease. (Ref. 28.)."}

Recently, angiogenesis has gained an increasing interest as a prognostic factor in a variety of solid tumours. In this study we aimed to assess the prognostic role of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC).A total of 52 consecutive colorectal cancer patients with stage I to IV disease was included. In addition to routine laboratory and staging procedures, serum VEGF, b-FGF levels, and nitrate levels as a surrogate marker for in-vivo NO production were assayed. Serum VEGF concentrations, adjusted to the platelet count were found to be a significant factor for overall survival in univariate analysis (P=0.033). A new angiogenic index (AI), derived from serum VEGF and nitrate concentrations, was established. AI is the only independent prognostic factor of survival in all patients (P=0.008, Cox regression analysis). Likewise, AI is also significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with operable CRC (P=0.032, Cox regression analysis). In conclusion, serum VEGF and NO levels have prognostic role in patients with CRC and the new angiogenesis index using the serum levels of the factors seem to be useful."}

Many advances have been made in the field of colorectal cancer follow-up since the pioneering efforts of Wangensteen and others with second-look operations in the 1950s. The understanding of the biology and natural history of colorectal malignancy has been advanced. Diagnostic methods for detection of recurrent disease have also advanced tremendously with CEA monitoring, immunoscintigraphy. CT, MRI, and PET imaging. As has been discussed in this article, however, no strategy of postoperative follow-up has been shown unequivocally to produce improved survival benefit or cure rate. It is quite possible that benefit will be shown, but well-controlled trials will be required. Cost considerations will likely prove important, because the rate of detection of curable disease will likely.be low. Quality of life issues will also be important in such trials. Better treatment and outcome ol recurrent disease would provide a strong rationale for vigorous postoperative surveillance. New recommendations are currently evolving [54]. Early diagnosis seems likely to enhance the curability of both local and distant relapses and second primary tumors. Furthermore, there may be a survival and quality of life advantage that results from the early institution of chemotherapy, even for those tumors found to be inoperable [55]. In devising a plan for follow-up in patients, it is important to recognize the anatomic and temporal patterns of recurrence as well as their relationships to the initial tumor staging. Although there is little proof that the identification of recurrent disease in follow-up programs increases the likelihood of resectability, cure, or prolonged survival, many physicians have witnessed successful treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer. These anecdotal experiences, the unproven belief that follow-up is beneficial, and traditions imparted during training are among the likely motivating factors for most physicians caring for colorectal cancer patients."}

Approximately 15% to 18% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancers present with metastases confined to the liver. Although many may undergo a liver resection procedure, some will not be candidates for surgery or will have recurrence of liver disease within the first 2 years after liver metastasis resection. For this subset of patients, regional hepatic chemotherapy, including intra-arterial chemotherapy, has been shown to improve control of the disease and, in some cases, prolong survival. With the advent of laparoscopic surgery and its application to more and more advanced procedures, the possibility of laparoscopic placement of a chemotherapy infusion catheter in the hepatic artery with all the advantages of a minimally invasive approach appears to be a viable alternative in our hands. From November 1993 through February 2002, 20 patients (12 male, 8 female) successfully underwent laparoscopic placement of a hepatic artery infusion catheter at the Texas Endosurgery Institute. Correct placement of the catheter was confirmed by methylene blue injections via the hepatic artery catheter at the time of surgery. Chemotherapy was generally initiated in the immediate postoperative period. Mean age was 68.3 years (range, 46-82). Twelve of the patients (60%) had previously undergone abdominal surgery. There were 27 major laparoscopic procedures performed at the time of hepatic artery catheter placement. There were no conversions to an open procedure. Mean operative time was 186 minutes (range, 125-280), and mean blood loss was 132 mL (range, 20-300). These values include the 27 major concurrent laparoscopic procedures performed at the time of catheter placement, including 18 cholecystectomies, 7 colectomies, and 2 liver resections. Median hospital stay was 3 days (range, 3-25), with a median return to regular diet of 3 days. There were no intraoperative complications and no deaths secondary to catheter placement. There were 2 late complications, for an overall rate of 10%. For all 17 patients with residual hepatic disease whose chemotherapy was successfully instituted, regression of the metastases was evident by abdominal computed tomographic criteria and CEA levels. Laparoscopic hepatic artery catheterization is both feasible and safe. It incurs all the benefits of a minimally invasive procedure and can be performed at the time of laparoscopic colectomy to avoid the necessity of a second procedure."}

To evaluate the clinical relevance of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection of CEA and CK20 transcripts, as potentially related to tumor cell dissemination, in blood and peritoneal lavage from patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. Dissemination of single colorectal cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity, as well as in tumor drainage and peripheral blood vessels, might play a role in the metastasis process, thus affecting the clinical course. However, this phenomenon needs further elucidation. In a prospective study the authors evaluated the potential of qPCR in the detection of CEA and/or CK20 transcripts in the peritoneal lavage fluid and in the peripheral and mesenteric venous blood of 39 patients undergoing curative resection for colorectal cancer. Peritoneal lavage and peripheral blood was sampled before and after tumor resection; mesenteric venous blood was sampled from the major tumor-draining vein immediately before clamping. After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, qPCR was performed using specific cDNA primers and probes for CEA and CK20. The dichotomous results from the qPCR were used as a predictor along with other covariates in Cox proportional hazard regression models of long-term outcome (disease-free survival and overall survival). Of 39 patients, 11 were positive. The median follow-up at analysis was 31 months for all patients. The dichotomous qPCR covariate was significant, with P =.001 and.0035 for disease-free survival and overall survival, respectively, in the proportional hazard regression models with only qPCR. In seven patients, disseminated colorectal cancer cells were found in the peritoneal lavage fluid but not in blood specimens; five of these patients (71%) had recurrence. These data suggest that detection of mRNA coding for CEA and/or CK20 using qPCR has potential clinical utility as a prognostic marker and should be evaluated in larger clinical studies. Identification of patients at high risk for metastatic disease after curative resection of colorectal cancer might be improved by analyzing peritoneal lavage specimens in addition to blood samples. This is based on the observation that in more than half of qPCR-positive patients, disseminated colorectal cancer cells were detected in peritoneal lavage specimens but not in blood samples, and that 71% of them had recurrence."}

Colorectal carcinoma poses a serious public health threat. Detection in its early stages in the best predictor for long-term survival, which is the impetus for population-based screening programs. We believe that full-colon imaging by either DCBE or colonoscopy is necessary for colon cancer screening because flexible sigmoidoscopy, even if perfect, only detects 50% to 60% of colon cancers, a rate far worse than even the worst rate reported for single-contrast barium enema. Screening for colon cancer with flexible sigmoidoscopy is equivalent to performing a \"left\" mammogram for the detection of breast cancer. The role of CT colonography is still to be determined. When confronted with a symptomatic patient, barium enema is applied in conjunction with CT to detect primary colorectal carcinoma, to differentiate it from other benign and malignant processes involving the colon, and to assess for disease extent before surgery in selected high-risk patient populations. Pelvic MRI may be useful in the preoperative assessment of patients with rectal carcinoma as a means for assisting surgical planning. CT, MRI, and barium enema are used in postoperative follow-up for detecting local recurrence and distant spread. In response to known difficulty in discriminating between normal postoperative changes and tumor recurrence and in determining the nature of certain liver lesions, FDG-PET has been approved for the detection and localization of recurrent colorectal cancer in patients with rising CEA levels and indeterminate findings on standard imaging studies. Given its current promise of offering high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, the indications for PET may well expand in the future, but its final role in still to be determined."}

The status of the hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes and prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen level were significant independent prognostic factors. Patients with pulmonary metastases potentially benefit from pulmonary metastasectomy even when there is a history of solitary liver metastasis. Careful follow-up is warranted, because patients with recurrent pulmonary metastases can undergo repeat thoracotomy with acceptable long-term survival. Simultaneous bilateral metastasectomy confers no survival benefit. Prospective studies may determine the significance of this type of pulmonary metastasectomy."}

Positive carcinoembryonic antigen-mRNA expression was detected in 7 (43.8%) of 16 patients. Six (85.7%) of those 7 patients had hematogenous rerecurrences during the 1- to 3-year follow-up period. None of 9 negative-patients showed re-recurrence (p < 0.01). Among the 9 of 16 patients receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, no clear effect was noted regarding re-recurrence in the positive carcinoembryonic antigen-mRNA patients. These results suggest that the molecular detection of circulating cancer cells at the time of surgery for colorectal liver metastases could be one measure of high-risk patients for hematogenous re-recurrence after partial hepatic resection."}

Hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose-based bioresorbable membrane (Seprafilm ) has been used as a method of postoperative adhesion prevention. However, its short-term effect on colorectal cancer recurrence remains unknown. A retrospective chart review was undertaken of patients with colorectal cancer operated on with curative intent from 1996 to 1999. All patients who received Seprafilm during surgery were assigned to the Seprafilm group, whereas all patients who did not were placed in a control group. Tumor recurrence was defined as persistently elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels, pathologic confirmation of endoscopic findings, or radiographically documented lesions in the liver, lung, or pelvis. There were 63 patients in the Seprafilm group and 93 in the control group. The two groups were well matched according to all standard clinical and pathologic characteristics. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was administered to 23 patients (36.5 percent) in the Seprafilm group and to 44 (47.3 percent) in the control group ( P= 0.24). At a mean follow-up of 11.4 +/- 7.3 months in the Seprafilm group and 14.2 +/- 11.9 months in the control group, there were 6 (9.5 percent) and 15 (16.1 percent) recurrences, respectively ( P= 0.33). The 1- and 2-year disease-free survival rates were 88 and 85 percent, respectively, in the Seprafilm group and 85 and 72 percent, respectively, in the control group (log-rank test, P= 0.44). Seprafilm did not adversely affect the short-term recurrence rate after curative resection of colorectal cancer. In addition, it did not appear to compromise the short-term oncologic outcome. However, with a short follow-up and a small denominator, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn. This study does intimate that larger, longer-term, prospective, randomized studies may be safely conducted."}

The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has diverse applications when dealing with patients with colon-rectal cancer. The clinical value may be divided between preoperative evaluation of the tumor extension and its prognosis and the postoperative monitoring of the recurrence. We carried out this study to investigate and determine whether there is a relation between the preoperative value of the CEA and survival and if it may be considered as an independent prognosis factor in colon-rectal cancer. We evaluated 122 patients with colon-rectal cancer, who had had curative surgery and we analyzed different variables in univaried and multivaried form, to determine independent prognosis factors (CEA, sex, age, degree of differentiation, tumor size, ganglionar compromise, and the level of wall infiltration). The ganglionar compromise, the level of intestine wall infiltration and the CEA preoperative value lower than 5 ng/ml had a significantly higher survival than those with values higher than 5 ng/ml, regardless of other factors. We concluded that the preoperative determination of Carcinoembryonic Antigen represents a non-invasive study clinically useful in dealing with colon-rectal cancer and that its value has a significant statistical value as an independent prognosis factor in colon-rectal patient survival."}

Sixty-four CRC patients, with RNA of good quality available from paraffin-embedded LN specimens, were selected from 84 stage II patients who underwent curative surgery between 1988 and 1996. We investigated associations between the presence of micrometastases by each method and prognosis. Micrometastases were detected in 19 (29.6%) of 64 patients by RT-PCR and in 35 (54.7%) of 64 patients by IHC. By RT-PCR analysis, patients exhibiting a positive band for CEA mRNA had a significantly worse prognosis than those who were RT-PCR-negative, with respect to both disease-free and overall survival (P =.027 and.015, respectively). By IHC analysis, the presence of micrometastasis did not predict patient outcome in terms of either disease-free or overall survival. Infiltrating pattern of tumor growth characteristic was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival among various clinical or pathologic factors. By multivariate Cox regression analysis, micrometastasis detected by RT-PCR and the Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction were both independent prognostic factors. Micrometastases detected by RT-PCR, but not IHC, may be of clinical value in identifying patients who may be at high risk for recurrence of CRC and who are therefore likely to benefit from systemic adjuvant therapy."}

This study aims to assess the influence of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) detection of recurrent disease on the management of patients with colorectal cancer and suspected recurrence. One hundred and twenty patients with suspected recurrence were studied with FDG-PET. Fifty-eight patients were referred for FDG-PET because of the elevation of serum tumour markers. Thirty-one patients were referred because of inconclusive results of conventional imaging modalities. Twenty-five patients had known recurrence and were referred for pre-surgical assessment. Six patients were referred because of abdominal pain. A major management change was considered when, as a consequence of FDG-PET results, medical treatment was changed to surgical, or surgical to medical or to no treatment. A minor management change was considered when changes were made within a treatment modality. Of the 58 patients with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), FDG-PET detected recurrence and led to a major management change in 34 (58%). Eighteen underwent curative surgery and 16 were treated with systemic therapy. Of the 31 patients evaluated because of inconclusive results of conventional imaging modalities, FDG-PET was positive for recurrence in 24 and negative in seven. A major management change took place in 14 patients (45%). Of the 25 patients evaluated to rule out other sites of disease before surgery, FDG-PET did not show any other site of recurrence in 13 (52%) and showed more lesions in the remaining patients. Major management change took place in eight patients (32%). Overall, in the 120 patients studied, FDG-PET resulted in major management changes in 58 (48%), minor changes in four (3%) and no change in 54 (45%). It can be concluded that FDG-PET has a significant impact on the management of patients with suspected recurrence of colorectal cancer. FDG-PET detection of recurrence frequently allows curative surgical intervention. The early identification of distant metastases may also facilitate the implementation of systemic treatment."}

In all, 146 consecutive hepatic resections in 137 patients operated in the period between 1977 and 1999 were studied. Of these patients, 113 were classified into five CRS groups. Perioperative mortality was 1.4% (2 patients; no death in 120 patients operated after 1985) and morbidity was 38%. Five-year actuarial survival (perioperative mortality included) was 29% (median 37 months), and actual 5-year survival was 25% (17/69 patients). Patients operated after 1995 lived longer than those operated before 1995. Multiple regression analyses identified preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen CEA <100 mg/L, nodal status at resection of primary tumor, and R0 vs. R1/R2 resection as prognostic parameters. CRS grouping had prognostic importance. The relative risk (hazard rate) of tumor recurrence in patients with CRS 3-4 was 2.1, compared to that of patients with CRS 0-2. Five-year actuarial survival in the two groups was 12% and 40%, respectively. Fourteen of 15 long-term survivors (>5 years) classified by the CRS system had CRS of 2 or less. Resection for colorectal liver metastases is safe, and long-term survival rates are acceptable.

Mesenteric lymph node metastases from the primary tumor and the prehepatectomy serum carcinoembryonic antigen level were significant. In multivariate analysis, positive mesenteric lymph node was an independent prognostic factor. In the recurrent patterns, mesenteric lymph node metastases were associated with extrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy. The prehepatectomy carcinoembryonic antigen level and mesenteric lymph node metastases of the primary tumor were the most important predictive factors for long survival after hepatectomy.

Carcinoembryonic antigen is an acid glycoprotein, the levels of which may increase in patients with colorectal carcinoma. The prognostic significance of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels and their relationship to other risk factors are still debatable issues. Among 512 patients operated on for colorectal cancer, whose preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations were evaluated, linear correlations were established between carcinoembryonic antigen overexpression and carcinoma staging, diameter and grading, though these were not statistically significant. Moreover, metastatic cancers were significantly more frequent in patients with increased plasma concentrations of the marker (> 60 ng/ml). There were no correlations between increased carcinoembryonic antigen levels and age, ploidy, or site and shape of the cancers. As regards survival, patients with normal preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels had a better prognosis in terms both of lower local recurrence rates and long- term survival. In addition. In Dukes stages B and C elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen above the cut-off point can be considered a significant prognostic factor capable of identifying a group of patients at high risk who may be candidates for aggressive adjuvant therapies and follow-up. The findings of this study suggest that preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels are of prognostic importance in relation both to cancer staging and to long-term survival, which may have significant clinical applications."}

Serum concentrations of the markers were measured at the time of diagnosis in 161 patients with benign and 125 with malignant gastrointestinal diseases. Concomitant use of the markers was evaluated in a logistic regression model. CA 19-9, CA 242 or CA 72-4 showed similar sensitivity of 44% for gastric cancer, whereas CEA was elevated in 25% of the cases. In patients with colorectal cancer, CEA was most frequently elevated (54%), followed by CA 242 (46%), CA 19-9 (36%) and CA 72-4 (25%). High CA 19-9 and CA 242 serum levels were frequent in patients with cholangiocarcinoma (86% and 68%, respectively) and pancreatic cancer (80% and 63%, respectively).

Mitomycin C, 30 mg/m(2)/d infusion in the first day every cycle through the port. Response to the treatment was evaluated by serial determinations of plasma CEA and imaging techniques consisting of computerized tomography and sonography of liver. Sixty-eight were performed hepatic artery chemotherapy and fifty-six were followed up among seventy-five HAC patients. Twenty-six patients(46.4 %) have responded and 4 complete remission were achieved. Eight patients (14.3 %) had stable liver metastases.

Thirty-six patients with primary and secondary liver cancers (21 with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, 12 with colorectal cancer liver metastases and 3 with other malignant liver metastases), which were considered not suitable for curative resection, were include in this study. They were treated either with RFA (RITA2000, Mountain View, California, USA) percutaneously (n=20) or intraoperatively (n=16).The procedures were performed using the ultrasound guidance. The quality of RFA were based on monitoring of equipments and subject feeling of the practitioners. Patients treated with RFA was followed according to clinical findings,radiographic images, and tumor markers. Thirty-six patients underwent RFA for 48 nodules. RFA was used to treat an average 1.3 lesions per patient, and the median size of treated lesions was 2.5 cm (range, 0.5-9 cm). The average hospital stay was 5.6 days overall (2.8 days for percutaneous cases and 7.9 days for open operations). Seven patients underwent a second RFA procedure (sequential ablations). Sixteen HCC patients with a high level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and 9 colorectal cancer liver metastases patients with a high level of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) have a great reduction benefited from RFA. Four (11.1 %) patients had complications: one skin burn; one postoperative hemorrhage; one cholecystitis and one hepatic abscess associated with percutaneous ablations of a large lesion. There were 4 deaths: 3 patients died from local and system diseases (1 at 7 month, 1 at 9 month, and 1 at 12 month), 1 patients died from cardiovascular shock, but no RFA-related death. At a median follow-up of 10 months (range, 1-24 months), 6 patients (16.7 %) had recurrences at an RFA site, and 20 patients (56.7 %) remained clinically free of disease. RF ablation appears to be an effective, safe, and relatively simple procedure for the treatment of unresectable liver cancers. The rate and severity of complications appear acceptable.

We compared the CEA expression in esophageal, gastric and colorectal carcinomas in order to elucidate its diagnostic and prognostic significance and to evaluate the potential role of tissue CEA localization for the clinical evaluation of esophageal carcinomas. CEA expression in 84 biopsies of carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (38 colorectal, 22 gastric, 24 esophageal) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Sixty-two percent of the squamous carcinomas of esophagus, all five esophageal adenocarcinomas arising in Barrett esophagus, 86 percent of gastric adenocarcinomas and 89 percent of colorectal adenocarcinomas were CEA-positive. In colorectal and gastric adenocarcinomas, CEA staining was present, usually at the luminal membrane of neoplastic glands and in intraluminal material. Signet ring cells were strongly positive for CEA. In esophageal carcinomas staining was mostly cytoplasmic and in the better differentiated tumors it was particularly prominent at the center of epithelial pearls. Intensity of staining was highest in well-differentiated carcinomas and lowest in poorly-differentiated carcinomas. A clear correlation was seen between the degree of tumor differentiation and CEA expression for carcinomas of the esophagus, stomach and colon. Our results support the potential usefulness of CEA for monitoring the recurrence of gastric or esophageal tumors. Immunohistochemical determination of tumor CEA content could be a useful adjunct for the management of gastrointestinal carcinomas, by improving interpretation of serum CEA levels."}

FDG PET does not replace imaging modalities such as CT for preoperative anatomic evaluation but is indicated as the initial test for diagnosis and staging of recurrence and for preoperative staging (N and M) of known recurrence that is considered to be resectable. FDG PET imaging is valuable for differentiation of posttreatment changes from recurrent tumor, differentiation of benign from malignant lesions (indeterminate lymph nodes, hepatic and pulmonary lesions), and evaluation of patients with rising tumor markers in the absence of a known source. Addition of FDG PET to the evaluation of these patients reduces overall treatment costs by accurately identifying patients who will and will not benefit from surgical procedures. Although initial staging at the time of diagnosis is often performed during colectomy, FDG PET imaging is recommended for a subgroup of patients at high risk (with elevated CEA levels) and normal CT and for whom surgery can be avoided if FDG PET shows metastases. Screening for recurrence in patients at high risk has also been advocated. FDG PET imaging seems promising for monitoring therapy, but larger studies are necessary."}

Elevated preoperative serum YKL-40 levels in patients with colorectal carcinoma are associated with a significantly poorer prognosis compared to patients with normal serum YKL-40. In the current study the authors evaluated the value of serum YKL-40 in monitoring patients with colorectal carcinoma. YKL-40 was determined by an in-house radioimmunoassay method in serum obtained pre- and postoperatively from 324 patients who underwent curative resection (Dukes Stage A: 47; B: 148; C: 119; and D: 10). The patients were followed with serum YKL-40 levels every 6 months postoperatively, and the median followup time was 82 months (range, 68-95). In that period 146 patients died. Serum YKL-40 was significantly decreased in the first postoperative blood sample in 62% of patients with high preoperative levels. In addition, patients with high serum YKL-40 (adjusted for age) six months after curative operation had significantly shorter survival times (P = 0.0002) and shorter relapse free intervals (P = 0.004) than patients with normal postoperative serum YKL-40. This result was independent of simultaneous serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels at six months. Analysis of survival by scoring serum YKL-40 as a time-dependent covariate in a Cox regression analysis showed that patients exhibiting elevated serum YKL-40 had an increased hazard for death within the following six months compared to those patients with normal serum YKL-40 level (hazard ratio [HR] = 9.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0-15.5, P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis including Dukes stage, age, gender, and tumor location as well as the time-dependent serum YKL-40 showed that high serum YKL-40 was an independent prognostic variable of survival (HR = 8.5, 95% CI: 5.3-13.7, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that determination of serum YKL-40 during followup of patients operated on for colorectal carcinoma might be useful for monitoring curatively resected patients."}

Clinical oncologists have always shown great interest in circulating tumor markers. There are several markers that in the clinical routine are a signal of particular tumor types; some of them are strictly tissue-specific such as prostatic specific antigen (PSA) for prostatic cancer, AFP and HCG for germ cell tumors of the testis and ovary, others such as CA 15.3, CA125, CEA or cytokeratins are less specific since their elevations can be found in different varieties of cancers even if they are preferentially associated to a certain tumor type, thus are considered markers for breast, ovarian cancer and colon adenocarcinoma. The most useful clinical applications of these parameters is their determination during the follow-up of the treated patients, in order to detect the tumor recurrence early, and also to evaluate the evolution of the disease by monitoring the treatment responses. During follow-up, increasing levels of tumor markers can be observed even several months before the clinical demonstration of cancer recurrence. The association of tumor marker tests with imaging modalities can lead to several advantages: the first is to confirm the diagnosis of relapses, possibly before the appearence of the related clinical symptoms due to tumor growth; the second is to localize the sites of lesions, while tumor markers provide only a general indication of the existence of metastases; the third is to make possible a correct whole body restaging. In the assessment of cancer response tumor markers are often very reliable and their changes are faster than the morphological ones. Among all the imaging modalities, nuclear medicine plays an important role in detecting recurrences and metastatic localizations as it is able to investigate functional rather than morphological aspects of tumors, and provide different information in comparison to morphologic imaging. In addition, the scintigraphic techniques offer the possibility to evaluate treatment responses, confirming or not the information from biochemical changes. This review aims to show some examples (breast, prostate and ovarian cancer) in which the combination of nuclear medicine imaging modalities and tumor marker tests is proposed for clinical practice. The advantages and some critical aspects are discussed on the basis of the clinical findings and the most important clinical indications are described."}

Cryotherapy was used when a complete tumour resection was not feasible, but complete tumour destruction by cryotherapy seemed possible. Mean follow-up was 21 months. The mean number of lesions per patient was 2.6 (1-10) with a mean maximum diameter of 3.7 cm (1-11). In 36 of 71 patients cryotherapy was used in combination with liver resection. Morbidity and hospital mortality were 23 % and 2.8 %. In 25 of 34 patients with colorectal primary and preoperatively elevated CEA it returned to normal postoperatively (74 %). 40 of the 60 patients with \"R0-treatment\" developed tumour recurrence, 10 of these at the cryosite (17 %). Median survival for all patients (colorectal metastases) was 28 (29) months with a 3- and 5-year survival rate of 38 % (43 %) and 30 % (33 %), respectively. Cryotherapy is an effective parenchyma sparing method for the treatment of malignant liver tumours in a curative approach. It can be performed safely and a long-term local tumour control is achieved in a high percentage of patients. Survival rates following cryotherapy appear comparable to the results of liver resection. It seems justified to conduct a prospective randomised trial comparing liver resection and cryotherapy for resectable tumours."}

Physicians are often faced with the dilemma of how to incorporate tumor markers into routine clinical decision-making. Tumor markers may influence clinical decisions at various stages of cancer therapy: screening, diagnosis, prognosis, detection of early relapse, and monitoring of therapy. We use the examples of beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-HCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as markers for germ cell tumors (GCT), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a marker for prostate cancer, to illustrate their use and limitations for these purposes. We then focus on monitoring and choice of treatment by presenting three vignettes; these highlight the potential benefits and problems associated with the use of tumor markers for monitoring and detection of early relapse in asymptomatic patients."}

From January 1980 to December 2000, 80 patients, 43 women and 37 men with median age 63 years (range 38-79 years) underwent 98 open surgical procedure (96 muscle-sparing thoracotomy, one clamshell and one median sternotomy) for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer (three pneumonectomy, 17 lobectomy, seven lobectomy plus wedge resection, six segmentectomy, three segmentectomy plus wedge resection and 62 wedge resection). Pulmonary metastases were identified at a median interval of 37.5 months (range 0-167) from primary colorectal resection. Second and third resections for recurrent metastases were done in seven and in four patients, respectively. Operative mortality rate was 2%. Overall, 5-year survival was 41.1%. Five-year survival was 43.6% for patients submitted to single metastasectomy and 34% for those submitted to multiple ones. Five-year survival was 55% for patients with disease-free interval (DFI) of 36 months or more, 38% for those with DFI of 0-11 months and 22.6% for those with DFI of 12-35 months (P=0.04). Five-year survival was 58.2% for patients with normal preoperative carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) levels and 0% for those with pathologic ones (P=0.0001). Patients submitted to second-stage operation for recurrent local disease had 5-year survival rate of 50 vs. 41.1% of those submitted to single resection (P=0.326). Pulmonary resection for metastases from colorectal cancer may help survival in selected patients. Single metastasis, DFI>36 months, normal preoperative CEA levels are important prognostic factors. When feasible, re-operation is a safe procedure with satisfactory long-term results."}

Patients with Dukes A (UICC I) colorectal cancer have a good prognosis after curative resection. It is not known, however, if the outcome is significantly different for UICC Ia and Ib patients or if patients with reduced risks of recurrences can be identified early after surgery. This is of interest, as it would permit a more cost-effective, patient-oriented, and tumor stage-oriented follow-up program. To study these questions, a prospective follow-up database, including 1375 patients after curative resection of colorectal cancer, was analyzed. A total of 296 patients with Dukes A colorectal cancer with a median follow-up of 44 months were studied. Perioperative and follow-up mortality rates were 3% and 14%, respectively. Recurrent disease developed in 10% of Dukes A patients after a disease-free interval of 16 months. Significantly more patients suffering from pT2 (UICC Ib) cancer had recurrent disease than patients with pT1 (UICC Ia) cancer (13% vs. 4%; p <0.05). Preoperative CEA levels in patients with recurrent disease were significantly higher than in long-term disease-free patients (5.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.6 ng/ml; p <0.05). Curative resection of recurrent disease was achieved in 38% of the patients with recurrences (4% of all patients). Survival analysis showed significantly better survival in patients with Dukes A cancer than in those at higher tumor stages (log rank, <0.0001), and only 39% of all Dukes A patients who died during follow-up had recurrent disease. Dukes A (UICC Ia and Ib) colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 22% of our patients treated for cure, and long-term survival was 86%. There were significantly fewer cases of recurrent disease after curative resection of UICC Ia (pT1N0M0) cancer, so we propose a novel, less intensive follow-up regimen for these patients, leading to a more cost-effective, patient-oriented, and tumor stage-oriented follow-up program."}

All patients also had correlative pre- and posttreatment CT or MRI for evaluation of the anatomic response and serum CEA determination for assessment of the total tumor load, as well as pretreatment hepatic intra-arterial technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin scan for lung shunting evaluation and hepatic arteriography for assessment of vascular anatomy and treatment. 90Y-glass microspheres were infused via an intra-arterial catheter under low pressure. Dedicated whole-body PET scans were analyzed visually and compared by lesion and by lobe with CT or MRI. A metabolic response after 90Y treatment to single or both hepatic lobes, assessed by PET, was present in a significantly higher proportion of the lobes than was an anatomic response, evaluated by CT or MRI (12 vs 2 lobes respectively, P<0.0002). Posttreatment PET showed no, stable, progressive, and new extrahepatic metastases in two, three, one, and two patients respectively. Following treatment, serum CEA decreased significantly, correlating with PET but not with CT or MRI. Thus, the study demonstrated a significant difference between the metabolic and the anatomic response after 90Y-glass microsphere treatment for unresectable liver metastases in colorectal cancer. PET appears to be an accurate indicator of treatment response."}

The assessment of response to chemotherapy of solid tumors is generally made by measurement of tumors visualized by imaging, commonly computed tomography scanning. However, response assessment based on imaging is not always feasible because patients often have disease not measurable by imaging study, such as diffuse peritoneal dissemination. Furthermore, response assessment by imaging is expensive and time consuming. This study was carried out in an effort to evaluate the correlation between serial change on imaging and on CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels for assessing chemotherapeutic response of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Between May 1998 and August 1999, a total of 40 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma were enrolled in this study. All the patients had to have measurable lesions. Oral tegafur-uracil 300 mg/m2/day and folinic acid 60 mg/day were administered concurrently for four weeks, repeated every five weeks, as the first-line treatment. Tumor marker CEA was examined before and during the whole course of treatment. Response based on CEA assessment was defined as a more-than 50% drop in serum CEA level for more than four weeks. The correlation between serial change on CEA and on imaging for assessing chemotherapeutic response was evaluated. Forty patients received a total of 318 courses of treatment and a response rate of 32.5% (95% confidence interval, 18.0% to 47.0%), including five complete responses and eight partial responses, was achieved by imaging studies. The pretreatment CEA levels were elevated beyond the normal cut-off value in 34 (85%) patients. The response rate evaluated by CEA assessment was 42.5% (17/40). Nine responders (22.5%) based on CEA had no remission on imaging. Agreement in assessment by imaging study and by CEA was observed in 20 patients (50%), including eight responders, five stable diseases, and seven progressive diseases. The sensitivity of falling CEA levels in the prediction of true responders on imaging was 62%. The sensitivity of elevated CEA levels for the prediction of progressive disease was 70%. Concerning the diagnostic accuracy, change in CEA levels in the prediction of true responders and progressive disease on imaging were 65% and 85%, respectively. On a follow-up of 24 months, patients with remarkable falling CEA levels survived significantly longer than non-responders (P = 0.0184, log-rank test). The measurement of CEA levels might be useful in monitoring chemotherapeutic response and in predicting the prognosis of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Serum CEA level may be used as a means of monitoring chemotherapeutic response when imaging study is unsuitable for assessing the response in clinical practice."}

The aim of this study was to determine the role of dual-head camera (18)F-FDG coincidence imaging (DHC (18)F-FDG) in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer. Sixty-seven DHC (18)F-FDG studies were performed on 62 patients with suspected recurrent colorectal cancer. Reports of contemporary CT were available for the purpose of correlation for 61 of the studies. The final diagnosis of the imaging findings was based on histology or clinical and imaging follow-up of at least 6 mo.

A literature search was performed to provide quantitative estimates for the main determinants of the effectiveness of the follow-up. Data were extracted from a total of 267 articles and databases, and were aggregated using modern meta-analytic methods. In order to provide one more colorectal cancer patient with long-term survival through follow-up, 360 positive follow-up tests and 11 operations for colorectal cancer recurrence are needed. In the remaining 359 tests and 10 operations, either no gains are achieved or harm is done. As the third aim of colorectal cancer follow-up, improved survival, is realised in only few patients, follow-up should focus less on diagnosis and treatment of recurrences. It should be of limited intensity and duration (3 years), and the search for preclinical cancer recurrence should primarily be performed by carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) testing and ultrasound (US). The focus of colorectal cancer follow-up should shift from the early detection of recurrence towards quality assessment and patient support. As support that is as good or even better can be provided by a patient's general practitioner (GP) or by specialised nursing personnel, there is no need for routine follow-up to be performed by the surgeon."}

Blood samples were obtained preoperatively from 151 consecutive patients who were operated for colorectal carcinoma; of these 132 patients underwent curatively aimed operations. Patients who lived for more than five years without any evidence of relapse were classified as survivors and those who died during follow-up were classified as non-survivors. Tumors were staged according to Dukes and tumor differentiation was classified as high, intermediate or low. Serum anti-p53 was determined in all patients and compared to CEA, CA 50 and CA 242 in serum as well as to blood hemoglobin concentration (Hb), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum alkaline phosphatases (ALP), in the same preoperative blood samples for comparison of power to predict mortality in colorectal cancer. Tumor differentiation and Dukes classification predicted survival and the risk to die of colorectal carcinoma as expected. CA 242 and anti-p53 titers in serum were not significantly different among groups of patients with Dukes A-D tumors, while Hb, ESR, ALP, CEA and CA 50 were significantly different with increasing levels appearing in Dukes C-D, except for Hb which decreased. Survivors had lower ESR, ALP, CEA, CA 50 and CA 242, while Hb and serum anti-p53 titers were not different among survivors and non-survivors. Survivors among Dukes A-C patients had normal Hb, ESR, ALP and CA 242 before operation, while non-survivors had increased ESR, CEA and CA 50. Levels of anti-p53 were unrelated to concentrations of all other blood and serum variables, and did not predict survival in Dukes A-D patients. Serum levels of CEA and CA 50 displayed a significantly altered distribution among survivors and non-survivors (p<0.01). This altered distribution was independent of Dukes A-C tumor stage for CEA (p<0.05) but not for CA 50. Based on these results, we conclude that patients with CEA levels above 15 ng/ml should be regarded as high risk patients even when their tumors are classified as Dukes B. These patients may benefit from neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy."}

Measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been widely applied to detect recurrence, especially of colorectal carcinoma. The validity however, is still controversial. We investigated serial changes in CEA values to calculate whether the CEA doubling time and half-life time could predict metastatic progression or prognosis in colorectal carcinoma. Pre- and post-operative serial serum CEA contents were determined in 22 cases of colorectal cancer with or without metastasis. CEA values were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Patients were assigned depending upon survival time (within vs. more than 18 months after primary resection) for assessment of CEA doubling time. From the gradient of the semi-logarithmic CEA graph, the preoperative doubling time was calculated and the postoperative half-life time was estimated according to the diagnosis of metastases within 2 years after primary resection [metastasis (+) or (-)]. In spite of the effect of curative re-operation of metastatic lesions or of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, the CEA doubling time of the groups showed a relation with prognosis (p = 0.045, Student's t-test) when the patients were divided into >18 and < or =18 months survival time.

Three hundred twenty-one consecutive nonselected patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with conventional 5-FU-based regimens as first-line treatment from 1988 to 1999. Factors related to patient, tumor, or treatment were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis by comparing short survivors (SS, those who survived <or=6 months) with those who survived longer than 6 months. The same statistical methods were used to analyze 200 patients, all treated with bolus 5-FU regimens, by comparing who progressed to treatment with those who did not. Sixty-two patients (19.3%) were SS, the remaining 259 patients survived more than 6 months. First-line chemotherapy included 5-FU in all patients; 112 (35%) and 27 (8.4%) patients were offered, after disease progression, second and third-line chemotherapy, respectively. The overall response rate to first-line chemotherapy was 12.9%. No SS patient achieved an objective response. To investigate factors associated with progression to first-line chemotherapy, we considered only those patients treated with bolus 5-FU regimens, to eliminate the variable of regimen used. Ninety-six of them progressed to treatment and 104 did not. At multivariate analysis, SS patients were characterized by the following: right and transverse colon primary (p = 0.006), younger age (p = 0.043), poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group >or= 2) (p = 0.015), elevated (>or=5 microg/l) serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (p = 0.015), and more than one site of metastatic disease (p < 0.001). Progression to first-line chemotherapy (p < 0.001) was also a strong factor associated with short survival in multivariate analysis; factors predictive of progression were elevated CEA (p = 0.027) and diffuse metastatic disease (p = 0.029). Our data indicate the relevance of some clinical prognostic factors (younger age, poor performance status, elevated CEA, site of primary, number of metastatic sites, resistance to chemotherapy) as independent factors associated with poor survival and progression to first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with conventional 5-FU regimens. Patients identified by these factors as having a poor prognosis and low probability of response to treatment should be considered either for more aggressive regimens or supportive care only: conventional 5-FU treatments do not impact on response or survival."}

We hypothesized that TA90-IC status and serum ganglioside levels might be useful markers and might be of prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. Serum samples from 68 patients undergoing surgical treatment for histologically proven colorectal cancer were analyzed for the presence of CEA, serum gangliosides, and TA90-IC. Forty-one patients had node-negative disease, whereas 27 patients had limited metastatic disease. The intent was curative resection, even for patients with metastatic disease. Cryopreserved serum specimens were analyzed in a blinded fashion for total serum ganglioside levels (by an assay that detects lipid-associated sialic acids), for CEA, and for TA90-IC (by a murine monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). A positive value for TA90-IC levels was defined as an optical density (OD) of more than 0.410 at 405 nm. Serum ganglioside levels were elevated more frequently than CEA concentrations (84% vs 44%). The combination of serum ganglioside and CEA values was more sensitive (88%) than CEA value alone (44%) in identifying patients with early-stage colorectal cancer. TA90-IC levels were elevated more frequently than CEA concentrations (56% vs 32%). The combination of TA90-IC and CEA values was more sensitive (72%) than CEA value alone (32%) in identifying patients with advanced-stage colorectal cancer. At an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cutoff level of 0.410, 15 (56%) patients had positive TA90-IC values. Fourteen patients alive with residual disease had a median OD TA90-IC level of 0.879, and only three patients had levels below the OD cutoff value of 0.410. Thirteen patients with no evidence of disease had a median level of 0.277, and only four patients had OD levels > or = 0.410. TA90-IC was significantly higher in the alive with residual disease patients than those rendered no evidence of disease (P = 0.02). We speculate that a multiple-marker analysis that combines CEA values with serum ganglioside and TA90-IC values may be more sensitive than CEA value alone for detecting colorectal cancer.

Progression-free and overall survival were longer for patients who received irinotecan/FUDR compared with patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy. The 2-year survival rate was significantly better for patients receiving adjuvant therapy compared with patients receiving no additional treatment. Predictors of improved survival included a preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level <100 ng/dl, >30% postoperative reduction in carcinoembryonic antigen level, and adjuvant therapy. Combined therapy with irinotecan/FUDR may improve the results of surgical cytoreduction for unresectable CRC hepatic metastases."}

Whereas radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has shown disappointing results in bulky, solid tumors, preclinical results in small-volume disease and in an adjuvant setting are promising. In a previous Phase I study, the authors had encouraging results with the iodine-131 ((131)I)-labeled humanized anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) antibody (MAb) hMN-14 in small-volume disease of colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a subsequent Phase II trial, the therapeutic efficacy of this (131)I-labeled humanized anti-CEA antibody in colorectal cancer patients with small-volume disease or in an adjuvant setting. Thirty colorectal cancer patients, with small-volume metastatic disease (n = 21; all lesions less-than-or-equal 3.0 cm, and chemorefractory to 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid) or in an adjuvant setting (n = 9), 4-6 weeks after surgical resection of liver metastases with curative intention, were studied. The patients were given a single injection of (131)I-hMN-14 immunoglobulin G at a 60 mCi/m(2) dose level, which was shown to be the maximum tolerated dose in the previous Phase I study. Follow-up was obtained at 3-month intervals for as long as 36 months. At a mean blood-based red marrow dose of 1.8 +/- 0.8 Gy, myelotoxicity was the only toxicity observed, but only 1 of 28 assessable patients developed transient Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Of the 21 patients with radiologically documented lesions, 19 were assessable. Three experienced partial remission and eight showed minor responses up to 15 months in duration (corresponding to an objective response rate of 16% and an overall response rate of 58%; the mean duration of response was 9 months). At the time this article was written, seven of nine patients in the adjuvant setting had remained free of disease for up to 36 months (one patient relapsed after 6 months and another after 30 months), whereas the relapse rate in a historical control group receiving chemotherapy was 67% over the same time period. Five patients with radiologically documented lesions, having experienced at least disease stabilization as a consequence of RIT, were retreated at the same 60-mCi/m(2) dose level at 8-16 months after the first therapy. No evidence of increased toxicity was observed (no hematologic toxicity was higher than Grade 3). Two of four assessable retreated patients experienced partial remissions; one of these four again experienced disease stabilization as a consequence of the second radioantibody therapy injection. These data suggest that RIT is a safe and effective form of therapy for small-volume colorectal cancer and has potential as treatment for colorectal cancer in an adjuvant setting. Toxicity is restricted to mild and transient leuko- and thrombocytopenia. Retreatment seems to be a feasible option. A prospective randomized comparison with standard chemotherapy is indicated."}

The prognostic significance of IL-10 and IL-6 serum levels in colon cancer patients undergoing surgery was investigated. To this end, 50 candidate patients with colon cancer for surgery were admitted to the study. Of these, 30 could be subjected to a potentially curative surgery. Cytokine serum levels at several time points before and after surgery were measured by ELISA. Circulating levels of IL-10 and IL-6 were found to be elevated in cancer patients with respect to controls. Both IL-10 and IL-6 serum levels were demonstrated to predict the likelihood of curative surgery (predictive accuracy, 83.3%). IL-10 serum levels returned to normal in all but 6 patients who underwent curative surgery. These latter had tumor recurrence (predictive accuracy, 100%). In contrast, IL-6 serum levels significantly decreased in all patients, regardless of whether cure was surgically achieved, but did not normalize. On multivariate analysis, basal IL-10 serum levels were found to be among the variables significantly predicting the disease-free survival rate. Stepwise regression selected tumor stage, basal IL-10 serum level, and basal CEA serum level as the best combination of variables for prediction of the likelihood of tumor recurrence. In conclusion, preoperative serum levels of IL-10 were shown to be useful markers for predicting both likelihood to perform curative surgery and, in combination with the 16th postoperative day IL-10 serum levels, tumor recurrence (predictive accuracy, 73.6 and 96%, respectively). IL-6 serum levels were found to have a more limited prognostic role."}

The only method of treatment that offers a favourable prognosis for colorectal carcinoma is radical resection of a part of the colon or rectum including the pertinent lymph glands and radical removal of metastases. However, even such presumably curative surgery does not ensure full recovery, as recurrences are frequent and, according to several analyses, the 5-year survival rate is less than 50%. The most significant reason for this poor therapeutic success are residual micrometastases. Therefore, additional treatment strategies are attempted in several patients. Various prognostic factors of disease recurrence are known. One such prognostic sign is the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level measured shortly after surgery. All patients operated on electively for colorectal carcinoma at our institution within one year were followed. According to preoperative serum CEA levels, the patients were divided into a study group (preoperative CEA more than 10 ng/mL) and controls (preoperative CEA less than 10 ng/mL). In the former category, patients who underwent radical R0 resection were divided into three groups according to their postoperative serum CEA levels and CEA half-life: (CEA) R0-, (CEA) R1- and (CEA) R2-resected patients. All patients were then followed for 24 months; the number of recurrences and survival rates were registered. A statistically significant difference in regard of survival and the number of recurrences was noted in patients divided according to the stage of disease, particularly between the three groups of patients from the study group undergoing curative surgery. After two years, survival was 96.97% in the CEA R0 group, 66.66% in the (CEA) R1 group and 50% in the (CEA) R2 group. Recurrences were as follows; 3.03% in (CEA) R0, 83.3% in (CEA) R1 and 100% in (CEA) R2. The results of our study confirm the prognostic value of serum CEA measurement, in particular its half-life, following surgery for colorectal carcinoma."}

Most colorectal cancers metastatic to the liver are resistant to chemotherapy and are not amenable to surgical resection. This study evaluated our 6-year experience (July 1992-July 1998) in treating patients with unresectable hepatic colorectal metastases refractory to systemic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). One hundred fifty-three patients underwent cryosurgical ablation (CSA) of 5-FU-resistant hepatic metastases. The patients then received either hepatic arterial floxuridine (FUDR), systemic CPT-11, or no postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Number, size, and location of hepatic metastases, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, and type of postoperative treatment were analyzed. One to 15 lesions were frozen (median number, 3; median size, 6 cm), for a total of 73 synchronous and 80 metachronous lesions. Overall median survival was 28.4 months from the date of diagnosis of liver metastases and 16.1 months from the time of CSA. After cryosurgery alone, median survival was 13 months, which was significantly shorter than the post-CSA survival of 23.6 months with adjuvant CPT-11 and 21.2 months with hepatic FUDR (P = 0.007). Predictors of survival included preoperative CEA, postoperative reduction in CEA, and adjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Neither size, number of lesions, nor tumor location impacted survival. At a median follow-up of 13 months, 67% of patients have recurred (35% hepatic, 16% extrahepatic, and 49% both). Twenty percent of the recurrences were in the lobe of the CSA site. The 25 patients who underwent a second CSA had a median survival of 28.4 months from CSA and 40 months from the date of diagnosis of liver metastases. These data indicate that CSA offers an effective alternative for unresectable patients resistant to 5-FU. Systemic CPT-11 or regional FUDR may further prolong survival after CSA."}

In a few patients, however, the asymptomatic rise in CEA is not accompanied by diagnostic findings on computed tomography (CT). We report a case herein, of a patient with rising CEA, noted 1 year after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for node-positive colorectal cancer. CT and laparoscopic exploration were nondiagnostic. In order to further evaluate the rise in CEA, positron emission tomography (PET) was performed. PET revealed an area of increased uptake in the right lobe of the liver.

In particular, we studied the correlation between pathological adverse prognostic factors and stainability of the mucosubstances and tumor-associated glycoconjugates in MUC. We demonstrated that MUCs were present in 21% of SICs, and 20% of SICs with MUC were involved in metastasis or recurrence, while only 6% of SICs without MUC were positive for it (p=0.005). SICs with MUC showed strong staining of carcinoembryonic antigen and Ulex europaeus I in the MUCs as well as in the cancer cells with high-grade atypia. Moreover, the mucins in MUCs predominantly stained for sialomucin. This study was the first to investigate the importance of mucous nodules in colorectal SIC. We concluded that MUC in SIC would be an important adverse prognostic factor, and that we should at least consider employing a similar treatment strategy for it to advanced colorectal carcinoma."}

IOR C-5 is a G1 immunoglobulin type intact murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) that was developed in the Center of Molecular Immunology in Havana City, Cuba. In immunohistochemical studies, this demonstrated a significant affinity for the epithelial tissues so that it was used in a pilot clinical study to perform a radioimmunoscintigraphy of the colorectal primary tumors and their locoregional recurrences. It was labeled with 99mTc using the Schwarz method, with a > 95% performance. Planar images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were performed at 10 minutes, 4-6 hours and 18-24 hours post-injection in the anterior and posterior projections and the SPECT was performed 4-6 hours and 18-24 hours post-injection of 1.85 GBq 99mTC. This study has aimed to verify in vivo the capacity of ior-C5 MAb to accumulate in the malignant colorectal lesions. ior-C5 accumulated in 5 out of the 7 patients who were studied and who were suffering from colorectal cancer or in whom there was suspicion of recurrence. There was a negative case of primary tumors, which was an adenocarcinoma in situ in a tubular-papillary adenoma. The second case with a negative radioimmunoscintigraphy was a true negative case. It can be concluded that even though the number of patients is quite low, ior-C5 fulfilled the expectations of recognizing the epitope expressed in colorectal tumors in an in vivo human environment."}

Cytological examination of peritoneal lavages is a useful predictor of peritoneal recurrence in gastrointestinal carcinoma patients. Nevertheless, it may be inadequate for those patients with lavages containing only few cancer cells. In the present study, sensitive detection of free cancer cells could be achieved through amplification of cytokeratin 19, carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein mRNAs by means of multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and nested polymerase chain reaction. The multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay was used to examine lavage samples from 64 patients with various gastrointestinal malignant lesions (colorectal n = 27; duodenal carcinoma n = 1; gastric n = 7; pancreatic n = 4; hepatocellular carcinoma n = 2; gallbladder n = 1; cholangiocellular carcinoma n = 2 and 20 colorectal liver metastases. Specificity was assessed by examination of 15 donors without malignancies. In addition, nested polymerase chain reaction was used to improve the sensitivity of the assay for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein transcripts. Peritoneal lavages from 12 of 64 gastrointestinal carcinoma patients were positive for carcinoembryonic antigen mRNA. Carcinoembryonic antigen proved a specific marker, as no false-positives were detected in any patients without gastrointestinal cancer. alpha-fetoprotein mRNA was detected exclusively in peritoneal lavages from tumor patients, i.e., in 16 of 27 colon cancer patients, 14 of 20 patients with colorectal liver metastasis, 2 of 7 patients with gastric cancer, two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 2 of 4 patients with pancreatic cancer. Cytokeratin 19 mRNA was not found a useful marker, since control patients without malignancies were also positive. Our data suggest that carcinoembryonic antigen- and alpha-fetoprotein mRNA in peritoneal lavage are potentially useful specific markers for early diagnosis of metastasis of gastrointestinal cancer. It has been shown that alpha-fetoprotein-specific nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction can detect not only hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but also malignant cells from other gastrointestinal carcinomas. In contrast, cytokeratin 19 mRNA lacks specificity for gastrointestinal cancer."}

Immunohistochemical localization of prolactin (n = 98), carcinoembryonic antigen (n = 98), and prolactin receptors (n = 56) was performed. The expression of prolactin messenger ribonucleic acid (n = 50) and prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (n = 50) was studied by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Further, prolactin amplimer was sequenced. Preoperative prolactin and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were significantly higher in patients with colorectal carcinoma than in controls (prolactin, P = 0.001; carcinoembryonic antigen, P = 0.0001). Univariate survival analysis showed that Dukes stage, histologic grade, and circulating prolactin were significant prognostic factors for determining overall survival (Dukes stage, P = 0.00001; histologic grade, P = 0.005; prolactin, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, besides Dukes stage, circulating prolactin emerged as the most significant independent prognostic factor influencing overall survival. Preoperative prolactin levels showed excellent significant correlation with response to therapy and progression of disease. A significant tenfold higher mean concentration of prolactin was observed in tumor-draining venous blood than in peripheral blood (P = 0.0001). Diffuse cytoplasmic staining for prolactin was seen in 51 percent (50/98) of the colorectal carcinomas. Prolactin messenger ribonucleic acid expression was seen in 88 percent (44/50) of the colorectal carcinomas. Sequence analysis of the 234-bp prolactin amplimer revealed that the sequence was homologous to exon 5 of pituitary prolactin messenger ribonucleic acid. These multiple approaches confirmed that prolactin is produced by colorectal carcinoma cells. Looking at its prognostic value and correlation with disease activity, it may provide new insights into treatment for patients with colorectal carcinoma."}

We evaluated 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan and CEA scan before second-look laparotomy as a means of localizing recurrent colorectal cancer. Patients underwent computed tomography scan, bone scan, colonoscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging, and those without evidence of disease or resectable disease in the abdomen had FDG-PET and CEA scans. At second-look laparotomy, a surgeon blinded to the results of the FDG-PET and CEA scans performed an exploration and mapped findings. A second surgeon, with knowledge of the FDG-PET and CEA scans, then explored the patient; all lesions were biopsied or resected for pathology. In 28 patients explored, disease was found at operation in 26 (94%). Ten had unresectable disease. FDG-PET scans predicted unresectable disease in 90% of patients. CEA scans failed to predict unresectable disease in any patient. In 16 patients found to have resectable disease or disease that could be treated with regional therapy, FDG-PET scan predicted this in 81% and CEA scan in 13%. FDG-PET scan can predict those patients who would likely benefit from a laparotomy. If the FDG-PET scan indicates resectable disease, laparotomy can be considered. However, if the findings predict unresectable disease or the absence of disease, the patient should pursue systemic therapy or continued observation."}

Combined radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) and hypoxic cytotoxin therapy (SR4233 or NLCQ-1) have been evaluated with both modalities administered on the same day with only moderate improvement compared with the effects of RAIT alone. In a series of studies using oxygen electrodes, immunohistochemistry and radiotracers, we have demonstrated that RAIT induces a prolonged state of hypoxia in most tumors, without affecting the pO(2) levels in normal tissues. Using serial microelectrode measurements through subcutaneous (s.c.) GW-39 human colonic xenografts, we established that the median pO(2) was unrelated to the initial size of the tumor, over a range of sizes from 1.0 to 4.0 cm. Fourteen days after mice were given a 240-microCi dose of (131)I-MN-14 anti-carcinoembryonic antigen immunoglobulin G, their median pO(2) declined from 26.1 +/- 9.6 mmHg to 9.8 +/- 3.9 mmHg (p < 0.001). Using the radiotracer (3)H-MISO that accumulates in hypoxic regions, uptake in GW-39, LoVo and LS174T s.c. human colonic tumors increased 3.0- to 4.2-fold from day 14 through day 28 post-RAIT, but uptake of (3)H-MISO in CALU-3 tumors remained unchanged after RAIT. Normal tissue (liver, kidney, lung) uptake of (3)H-MISO did not exhibit significant changes. The increase in tumor hypoxia was also demonstrated visually using anti-PIMO staining of tumor sections. We postulated that sequential delivery of the 2 therapeutic agents, with the hypoxic cytotoxin given 2 weeks after RAIT when tumor pO(2) levels were at their nadir, would improve the therapeutic response above either modality alone or above the 2 agents delivered on the same day. Tumor growth was compared in mice given either RAIT or cytotoxin alone, the combined treatment on the same day or with the cytotoxin delivered 14 days after RAIT. Tumor size on day 35 for RAIT-treated and SR4233-treated GW-39 were 3.56 +/- 0.40 and 7.98 +/- 2.50 cm(3). When RAIT + SR4233 were delivered on the same day, tumor size dropped to 2.78 +/- 0.80 cm(3). If RAIT was given on day 0 and SR4233 on day 14, size further declined further to 1.74 +/- 0.32 cm(3) (p < 0.05 compared with same day delivery). For LS174T, tumor size on day 28 for RAIT-treated and SR4233-treated tumors were 1.14 +/- 0.36 cm(3) and 3.65 +/- 0.78 cm(3), respectively. When RAIT + SR4233 were delivered on the same day, size was 0.51 +/- 0.174 cm(3). If RAIT was dosed on day 0 and SR4233 was given on day 14, tumor size was 0.13 +/- 0.07 cm(3) (p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained for LoVo, but not for CALU-3 tumors. Another hypoxic cytotoxin, NLCQ-1, was also more efficacious 2 weeks after RAIT, compared with same-day dosing. Thus, information on tumor hypoxia after radioantibody therapy could be important for ascertaining a window of opportunity when the surviving tumor regions are most responsive to hypoxic cytotoxins."}

Their relationship to clinicopathological variables and patient survival and changes in their levels after surgery were examined. Colorectal cancer patients showed significantly higher serum levels of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 compared with healthy controls. There was a significant association between the serum levels of these molecules, disease stage and the presence of both lymph node and distant metastases. Both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels correlated with serum E-selectin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Serum levels of all three molecules decreased significantly after radical resection of the tumour. Elevated pre-operative E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels were significant prognostic factors, although not independent of stage, for patient survival. These findings suggest that serum concentrations of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 may reflect tumour progression and metastasis.

A 57-year-old Japanese man with an intrapelvic tumor showing bone destruction due to the recurrence of rectal cancer after abdomino-peritoneal resection was diagnosed by CT scan. He consented to simultaneous adaptive cellular immunotherapy for local recurrent lesions by administration of the activated lymphocytes. The tumor sample used for the activation of PBMC was obtained by operation. Tumor cells were prepared by mincing and enzymatic digestion of the tumor sample, and they were irradiated with a dosage of 50 Gy. Peripheral blood samples were collected from the same patient. PBMC for about 2 weeks to prepare cells for treatment were obtained from the blood sample. One million PBMC were incubated in 2 ml of the culture medium containing 10(5) irradiated autologous tumor cells and 100 IU/ml recombinant IL-2. The activated PBMCs, as autologous cancer specific killer T cells, were administered by direct regional injection (from 2 million to 8 x 10(7) cells).

A local recurrent mass was discovered, and abdomino-perineal resection of the rectum was performed in 1999. The serum CEA level increased gradually August in 2000, but there was no sign of recurrence on CT or MRI. FDG-PET was performed to reveal a presacral recurrent lesion. Total pelvic evisceration combined with resection of the sacrum, and a bilateral ureterostomy were performed in April 2001. The beneficial role of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of the postoperative local recurrence of rectal cancer is emphasized."}
{"id": "11680046", "title": "Follow-up after curative surgery for colorectal cancer.", "content": "Follow-up after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Approximately 1 in 3 colorectal patients treated by surgery with curative intent will develop cancer recurrence, and most of them will die from disseminated disease. Post-operative follow-up aims at improving these ominous figures. Any strategy is justified as far as it influences evolution: global survival, disease-free period, quality of life. The value of follow-up for patients remains controversial. The literature review suggests that more intensive follow-ups lead to an increased number of reoperations, a more aggressive oncological approach in non resectable cases, provide data for an efficient quality control and have a major cost impact. Surveillance is appreciated by the patients who are confident in the efficacy of such policies. On the other hand, the benefit on the outcome of the patients is not formally established. Outcome might depend on tumoural characteristics rather than on the moment of recurrence detection. Not all schedules are alike, and CEA determination is required. Including all patients in intensive programs is not evidence-based medicine and is highly cost ineffective. Follow-ups must be tailored to individual characteristics. The most intensive ones are dedicated to the patients with the highest risk of treatable recurrence: high risk patients (tumour site and stage), able and willing to undergo reoperation (age, general condition,...). Research should try to determine curability tumoural factors (genetic tumour factors). In the meantime, and for the other patients, the most effective follow-ups could be programs in which only a few tests are routinely used: referential colonoscopy, history and physical examination, CEA determination and a rectoscopy for rectal cancers."}

The purpose of this study was to determine the role of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in localizing disease in patients with colorectal cancer with radiologically occult symptomatology or increases in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. Two hundred seventy-seven patients with colorectal cancer underwent PET scanning between November 1998 and September 2000 prompted by (1) increasing CEA level and nondiagnostic imaging or (2) symptoms with normal CEA level and nondiagnostic imaging. PET results were correlated with operative findings/histology, clinical follow-up data, and CEA level to determine PET's accuracy in determining the source of symptoms or CEA. Fifteen patients had increasing CEA levels, and 14 had abnormal PET. Two of these 14 were denied exploration because PET suggested widely metastatic disease. Nine patients underwent exploration with curative intent. In 1 patient, recurrence was not pathologically confirmed (false-positive rate, 8%). Two had disease beyond that predicted by PET, and 6 underwent complete resection and normalized their CEA levels. Four symptomatic patients with normal CEA levels and negative x-rays had abnormal PET; at exploration, 3 had no evidence of recurrence. PET imaging can often accurately localize the source of radiologically occult increases in CEA level and select that subset of patients eligible for therapeutic laparotomy. Symptomatic, PET-positive patients with normal CEA levels frequently undergo nontherapeutic laparotomy, and PET findings should be interpreted with caution in these patients."}
{"id": "11594285", "title": "[Influence of positron emission tomography on surgical therapy planning in recurrent colorectal cancer].", "content": "[Influence of positron emission tomography on surgical therapy planning in recurrent colorectal cancer]. The advantages of PET are high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of local tumor relapse, especially in comparison with conventional imaging techniques. Furthermore, there is an additional value of FDG-PET for the detection of tumor manifestations associated with a tumor marker (e.g. serum CEA) increase without suspicious findings in other diagnostic procedures. The methodological advantage of a whole-body examination further improves the detectability of distant metastases. Thus, FDG-PET may induce a change in the therapeutic concept in recurrent colorectal cancer in approximately 30% of cases, concerning the indication for surgery as well as the use of multimodal surgical concepts. By means of the metabolic functional approach FDG-PET offers the possibility of therapy monitoring. This enables very early and more specific indication of response to preoperative therapies or of the presence of residual disease after surgical tumor resection or interventional tumor ablation of metastases or recurrences. PET using new tracer molecules demonstrates an additional advantage of the technique regarding the determination of the micromilieu of a tumor (vascularity, proliferation) compared with all other non-invasive diagnostic methods. This opens up new possibilities to optimize surgical therapy planning and prognostic evaluation."}

Surgical specimens may also provide useful information for the appropriate treatment of patients. Using surgically resected lymph nodes, we examined micrometastasis to assess the spread of the cancer cells and the malignant potential of colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-cytokeratin antibody revealed no significant impact of micrometastasis on patient prognosis, while RT-PCR assay using CEA as a genetic marker suggested a positive value in predicting a rapid recurrence. Among various molecular markers, we found that CDC25B phosphatase was a powerful prognostic factor for colorectal cancer.

The patient was a 75-year-old man. He underwent resection of the transverse colon, sigmoid colon and distal stomach for colon and gastric cancers. Nine months after the operation, his CEA level increased to 39.5 ng/ml and a CT scan revealed an intra-peritoneal tumor measuring about 5 cm. He received chemotherapy of 30 mg/day of LV that was injected in a bolus and 500 mg/day of 5-FU that was given i.v. by continuous infusion for 10 days. At the end of 2 cycles of this regimen, CT scan demonstrated complete tumor remission and the patient's CEA level decreased to normal level. After an additional cycle of this regimen, he received modulated chemotherapy combined with l-Leucovorin and 5-FU as an outpatient. However, after 3 months of treatment, a recurrent tumor was detected in the same portion and the first regimen was re-started for 5 days. After 4 cycles of treatment the tumor disappeared completely from a CT scan. It is important to investigate effective regimens that do not reduce the quality of life of the patient. This clinical experience suggests that a low-dose LV/5-FU therapy may be beneficial to patients with recurrent colon cancer.

Measurement of tumor markers in serum of colorectal cancer patients after surgery is a sensitive method in early diagnosis of systemic spread of tumor cells. Moreover, prognostic association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) content in serum at the time of surgery is well known. However, fairly unclear is whether quantitative content of CEA and CA19-9 in cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients is correlated to prognosis. Concentrations of CEA and CA]9-9 were analyzed simultaneously in serum, cancer tissue, and normal colonic mucosa of 41 colorectal cancer patients operated for cure. Follow-up data were available for up to 82 months (median, 47 months) after surgery. During the follow-up period, 20 patients had a tumor recurrence, and all these patients died of metastatic disease. Using the median concentration of CEA and CA19-9 in tissues as a cut-off, no difference in overall and disease-free survival was observed between patients with elevated or normal CEA or CA19-9 concentrations in tumor tissue. However, in adjacent histologically normal mucosa, elevated CEA content was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (P = .0385) and disease-free survival (P = .0141) but not CA19-9 content. Despite the unknown biological function of tumor markers in malignant disease, measurement of tumor-associated antigens in colorectal tissues can become an interesting prognostic marker."}

Surgery can offer long-term survival and resection should be considered when liver metastases can be totally resected with clear margins and when there is no non-resectable extra-hepatic disease. The choice between anatomical or wedge resection depends on the number and the location of the metastases but does not influence survival. Clamping methods limit blood loss. Operative mortality is generally less than 5%. The five-year survival rate after surgical resection varies from 20% to 45% according to several prognostic factors. The longer survival is observed in patients with fewer than four lesions, with lesions smaller than 4 cm, without extra-hepatic disease, with lesions that appeared more than two years after the resection of a stage I or II colorectal cancer and whose CEA level is normal. After resection, follow-up can detect hepatic recurrence that can be treated with repeat hepatectomy. The efficacy of systemic chemotherapy using new agents can increase the number of patients amenable to surgery. Regional therapies with cryotherapy or radiofrequency ablation can help to treat unresectable or non-totally resectable lesions and may improve survival.

In March 1999, an abdominal CT scan revealed a tumor 3 cm in size at the inferior pole of the spleen. The tumor was hyperechoic on ultrasonography. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal. Since no other site of recurrence was identified, a splenectomy was performed with a curative intent. At laparotomy, neither hepatic metastasis, peritoneal dissemination, lymph node metastasis nor local recurrence was detected. Histological findings of the splenic tumor were compatible with metastasis of the previously resected sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. The patient has been disease-free for 19 postoperative months. Immunohistochemical staining for urokinase-type plasminogen activator was positive in primary sigmoid colon cancer and splenic metastasis, but negative in lymph node metastasis; results that possibly reflect the difference in progenitor cells between splenic metastasis and lymph node metastasis or the difference in the microenvironment of cancer cells between the spleen and lymph nodes. Based on the present case, we recommend that clinicians pay close attention to the spleen for the early diagnosis of isolated splenic metastasis when routinely evaluating abdominal CT scans and abdominal ultrasonography following curative resection of primary colorectal cancer."}

This study focuses on the significance of hydronephrosis as a prognostic marker for CRC by analysing the resectability and survival rates of patients affected. Retrospective data of 52 patients with hydronephrosis were analysed. Ten had primary CRC at different sites and 42 developed hydronephrosis 1-84 months following resection of a primary CRC. Twenty eight had unilateral and 24 bilateral hydronephrosis. In 10 patients with primary CRC and in 38 of those with a history of CRC, hydronephrosis was secondary to malignant obstruction. In four it was related to iatrogenic injury to the urinary tract. Complete surgical resection was possible in five patients (10%) with malignant obstruction. The remaining 90% underwent palliative or no surgical treatment due to diffuse metastasis or extensive local disease. No difference in survival was found between these two groups (6 vs 8 months) nor when comparing CEA levels, Duke's staging, or unilateral vs bilateral hydronephrosis. Patients with benign obstruction were treated by a ureteric stent, leading to resolution of hydronephrosis. All four are alive. Malignant hydronephrosis, secondary to primary or recurrent CRC, represents local manifestation of a disseminated disease with almost no probability of long-term survival and cure.

The present investigation was aimed at determining the presence of p53 mutations in the peripheral blood of breast cancer patients and its prognostic value in these patients. In this study, we found that the mean concentration of plasma DNA in healthy women was 21 ng/ml, whereas in patients with breast cancer the mean concentration was 211 ng/ml (P < 0.01). p53 mutations were detected in the primary tumors of 46 of 126 (36.5%) breast cancer patients. Of these 46 patients, 30 (65.1%) were found to have p53 mutations in their plasma DNA. p53 mutations in plasma DNA were strongly correlated with clinical stage, tumor size, lymph node (LN) metastasis, and estrogen receptor status (P < 0.05). After a median follow-up of 29 months, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that both primary tumor and plasma DNA p53 mutations were significant prognostic factors for both relapse-free and overall survival. Furthermore, we demonstrated that patients with both primary tumor and plasma p53 mutations have the worst survival. This outcome occurs in both LN-positive and LN-negative groups. Thirteen of the 22 (59%) patients with recurrence and/or metastasis later had detectable p53 mutations in their plasma DNA.

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the short and long term results of abdominoperineal resection for local recurrence following low anterior resection of a rectal adenocarcinoma and to determine the prognostic factors. From January 1978 to December 1996, 35 patients (17 women, 18 men) with a mean age of 59.4 years, underwent an abdominoperineal resection for local recurrence after low anterior resection of a rectal adenocarcinoma. The primary tumor was below the peritoneum in 29 cases, and the mean security margin was 3 cm under the tumor. Tumor staging at the time of primary surgery included 23 Dukes B, 11 Dukes C, and 1 Dukes D. The mean time elapsed between low anterior resection and local recurrence was 16.4 months. The histological diagnosis of recurrence was obtained preoperatively in 29 cases (82.8%). Resection was curative in 12 patients and palliative only in 23 patients. The recurrence was intramural in 3 cases, extramural in 10 cases, and mixed in 22 cases. Ten patients had an extended \"en bloc\" resection including one or several adjacent organs, and a synchronous metastasis was resected in 2 cases. The mortality rate was 2.8% (n = 1) and the morbidity rate was 23% (n = 8). The 1-year and 5-year survival rates were respectively 77 and 30.2% with the univariate analysis of prognosis factors of survival, there were four pretherapeutic factors (age, staging of the primary tumor, delay of the recurrence, CEA rate) and four therapeutic factors (curative resection, extramural recurrence, staging of the recurrence, postoperative radiotherapy). The curative or not curative type of resection was the only independent predictor of survival with multivariate analysis. The results of this study seem to justify an abdominoperineal resection for local recurrence after low anterior resection whenever possible.

There were no predefined criteria for resectability with regard either to the number or size of the tumours or to locoregional invasion, except that resection had potentially to be complete and macroscopically curative. All patients who had curative hepatic resection were advised to start postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The resectability rate in screened patients was 91 per cent (235 of 259 patients); the postoperative mortality rate was 4 per cent. In 35 patients resection of the primary tumour was performed simultaneously with partial liver resection. Forty-four patients (19 per cent) developed intra-abdominal recurrence; 14 (6 per cent) underwent reoperation and the recurrent tumour was resected. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 99 patients (55 per cent), most treatments being based on 5-fluorouracil with folinic acid. The overall actuarial survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 87, 60 and 36 per cent respectively.

Analysis of peritoneal washes from 241 gastric cancer patients with this assay revealed relative values of CEA transcripts that correlate well with the depth of tumor invasion. The sensitivity and specificity of real-time RT-PCR with a cut-off value of 0.25 were 88% and 81%, respectively. At this cut-off value, patients in the real-time RT-PCR (+) group were found to suffer from peritoneal metastasis with a high frequency, while peritoneal recurrence was very rare among patients with real-time RT-PCR (-) results. These results indicate a positive correlation between CEA mRNA levels in peritoneal washes and patient prognosis.

To clarify the relevance of micrometastasis of gastrointestinal tract cancers, we have established RT-PCT based-diagnostic methods using multi-markers such as CEA, CK20, and Mage 3. Prospective studies have shown that not a few micrometastasis-positive patients with carcinoma of the colon, stomach, and esophagus suffered disease recurrence, even though they did not show histologically positive lymph node metastasis. They were initially diagnosed as node-negative, and thus predicted to be disease free. A retrospective study of 62 patients with stage II node-negative colorectal cancer showed that 5-year overall survival was 78.2% among micrometastasis-positive patients, against 95.3% micrometastasis-negative patients. Moreover, there was a marked difference in 5-year disease-free survival, with 61.4% versus 88.4%, respectively.

Medical records of 110 patients operated on pulmonary metastases of primary colon/rectum cancer were reviewed. The clinical parameters include age, sex, pTNM/UICC stage, grading, localization, surgical and adjuvant therapy of the primary cancer. The number, maximum diameter and total intra-thoracic resected tumor-mass ('load'), the pre-thoracotomy serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, localization of the metastases (uni- vs. bilateral), the presence of hilar/mediastinal tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes, the surgical procedure and performed therapy schemes of lung metastases were recorded. The cumulated 5- and 10-year total survival after diagnosis of the primary carcinomas was estimated to 71 and 33.7%, respectively. After resection of the pulmonary metastases, the 3- and 5-year post-thoracotomy survival measured 57 and 32.6%, respectively. The median time interval between diagnosis of the primary cancer and thoracotomy (disease free interval (DFI)) was found to be 35 months. A non-negligible percentage of patients (15.4%) displayed limited tumor stages of the primary cancer (pT1/2, pN0). The median diameter of the largest metastasis measured 28 mm, and the median resected intrathoracic tumor-load was calculated to 11.4 cm(3). In only 8 patients hilar or mediastinal tumor-involved lymph nodes were found. A potentially curative resection of lung metastases was recorded in 96 patients. The overall survival was significantly correlated with the DFI and the number of intrapulmonary metastases. The DFI correlated significantly with the tumor load and the number of metastases; the post-thoracotomy survival with the number of metastases, tumor-load and pre-thoracotomy serum CEA level. Treatment, stage and grade of the primary cancer, occurrence of liver metastases and local recurrences, mode of treatment of metastases and postoperative residual stage had no significant correlation with either total nor post-thoracotomy survival. Pulmonary metastases occur even in patients with limited tumor-stages of primary colon/rectum cancer. DFI is the major parameter to estimate the total survival of patients with lung metastases. The survival after thoracotomy depends on the number of metastases, the intrapulmonary tumor load and the presence of elevated serum CEA level prior to thoracotomy."}

Combined evaluation of CEA, CA 19-9 and CA 242 serum levels in the overall population demonstrated a complementarity of CEA with the latter two markers. Conversely, a highly significant correlation was observed, suggesting that the two assays might recognize the same macromolecular complex. CA 242 determination does not seem to offer a particular advantage over CA 19-9, while CEA remains the marker of choice in monitoring colorectal cancer patients."}

As a sole modality, preoperative radiation for rectal carcinoma achieves a local control comparable to that of postoperative radiation plus chemotherapy. Although the addition of chemotherapy to preoperative treatment improves the pathologic complete response rate, there is also a substantial increase in acute and perioperative morbidity. Identification of subsets of patients who are at low or high risk for recurrence can help to optimize treatment. During the period 1977-95, 384 patients received preoperative radiation therapy for localized adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Ages ranged from 19 to 97 years (mean 64.4), and there were 171 females. Preoperative treatment consisted of conventionally fractionated radiation to 3600-5040 cGy (median 4500 cGy) 6-8 weeks before surgery in 293 cases or low doses of <3000 cGy (median 2000 cGy) immediately before surgery in 91 cases. Concurrent preoperative chemotherapy was given to only 14 cases in this study period. Postoperative chemotherapy was delivered to 55 cases. Overall 93 patients have experienced recurrence (including 36 local failures). Local failures were scored if they occurred at any time, not just as first site of failure. For the group as a whole, the actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) freedom from relapse (FFR) and local control (LC) were 74% and 90% respectively at 5 years. Univariate analysis of clinical characteristics demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) adverse effect on both LC and FFR for the following four clinical factors: (1) location <5 cm from the verge, (2) circumferential lesion, (3) near obstruction, (4) tethered or fixed tumor. Size, grade, age, gender, ultrasound stage, CEA, radiation dose, and the use of chemotherapy were not associated with outcome. Background of the surgeon was significantly associated with outcome, colorectal specialists achieving better results than nonspecialist surgeons. We assigned a clinical score of 0 to 2 on the basis of how many of the above four adverse clinical factors were present: 0 for none, 1 for one or two, 2 for three or four. This sorted outcome highly significantly (p < or = 0.002, Tarone Ware), with 5-year LC/FFR of 98%/85% (score 0), 90%/72% (score 1), and 74%/58% (score 2). The scoring system sorts the data for both subgroups of surgeons; however, there are substantial differences in LC on the basis of the surgeon's experience. For colorectal specialists (251 cases), the 5-year LC is 100%, 94%, and 78% for scores of 0, 1, and 2, respectively (p = 0.004). For the more mixed group of nonspecialist surgeons (133 cases), LC is 98%, 80%, and 65% for scores of 0, 1, and 2 (p = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, the clinical score and surgeon's background retained independent predictive value, even when pathologic stage was included. For many patients with rectal cancer, adjuvant treatment can be administered in a well-tolerated sequential fashion-moderate doses of preoperative radiation followed by surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy to address the risk of occult metastatic disease. A clinical scoring system has been presented here that would suggest that the local control is excellent for lesions with a score of 0 or (if the surgeon is experienced) 1, and therefore sequential treatment could be considered. Cases with a clinical score of 2 should be strongly considered for protocols evaluating more aggressive preoperative treatment, such as combined modality preoperative treatment."}

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of pelvic recurrent rectal cancer. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation was performed by placing a LeVeen needle electrode into the tumor. Radiofrequency ablation was performed on three lesions in two patients with pelvic recurrent rectal cancer, where the tumors were unresectable and associated with poorly controllable pain despite local treatment consisting of chemoradiotherapy. There were no major complications during the radiofrequency ablation procedure, although one patient complained of a sensation of warmth in the pelvic region, which was reasonably tolerated. Case 1: Each of two lesions of pelvic recurrence, 3 or 4 cm in diameter, was treated once by radiofrequency ablation with placement of a needle electrode into the tumor mass. After the procedure, magnetic resonance imaging confirmed nearly complete necrosis of the tumors, and there was a sufficient relief of pain enabling discontinuation of an opioid. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen returned to normal and there was no evidence of relapse six months after the treatment. Case 2: Radiofrequency ablation was performed by placing a needle electrode at two sites of a recurrent tumor 6 cm in diameter. Postradiofrequency ablation imaging showed viable tissue remnants along the tumor margin, but the treatment produced relief of pain. The procedure was effective in opioid dosage reduction and pain control within a limited time span. Radiofrequency ablation is a relatively readily maneuverable and safe local treatment for pelvic recurrence in rectal cancer and is considered a procedure worth applying with further accumulation of experience in clinical cases."}

To provide a detailed assessment of micrometastases of colorectal cancer by anatomical mapping of regional lymph nodes (LNs), we analyzed 237 LNs from 11 patients with colorectal cancer by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin 20 as genetic markers. All dissected LNs were mapped anatomically and subjected to detection assays for micrometastases. Immunohistochemical analysis was also performed using anti-pancytokeratin antibody AE1/AE3 to confirm the existence of occult cancer cells. By histological analysis, 20 of 237 LNs contained metastatic cells, and they were all positive by both immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Of the 217 histologically negative LNs, 14 (6.5%) harbored micrometastases by immunohistochemistry, and 57 (26.2%) were positive for at least one of the two genetic markers. Lymphatic mappings of all patients showed that micrometastases were distributed not only at the pericolic LNs but often at distant LNS: Clinical follow-up study showed that two patients developed recurrence within 1 year after surgery, and both of them had RT-PCR-positive micrometastases in not less than 70% of LNs examined. Moreover, both patients had frequent micrometastases at distant LNs, i.e., those around the root or along the inferior mesenteric artery, when compared with patients with no recurrence. Our findings suggest that genetic diagnosis using the RT-PCR method may be clinically useful along with conventional pathological diagnosis, especially when micrometastases spread to distant LNS:"}

The goal was to investigate the prognostic value of various molecular markers like CEA, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, c-Myc, p53, p21ras, Ki-67, CD44, Factor VIII-related antigen, cytokeratin-19, adenoma antigen, and prolactin in patients with Dukes B and Dukes C colorectal adenocarcinoma. These molecular markers were localized immunohistochemically in nonmalignant (n = 36) and malignant (n = 98) diseases of the colorectum. Data were analyzed statistically using the SPSS software program. The patients with colorectal cancer were followed for a period of five years or their death within that period. The expression of carcinoembryonic antigen, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, CD44, cytokeratin-19 and prolactin was significantly higher in malignant diseases (P < 0.05), whereas, p21ras was found to be significantly higher in nonmalignant diseases (P = 0.002) as compared with their respective counterparts. Besides Dukes stage, multivariate analysis indicated a significantly reduced relapse-free survival in patients expressing CD44 and cytokeratin-19 (P < 0.005). Similarly, besides Dukes stage, multivariate analysis indicated a significantly poor overall survival in patients expressing CD44, cytokeratin-19 and prolactin (P < 0.01). In patients with Dukes B disease, only cytokeratin-19 and CD44 expression attained statistical significance (P < 0.05), whereas in patients with Dukes C disease, CD44, p21ras- and c-Myc expression attained statistical significance (P < 0.018). Also, a multivariate analysis in relation to treatment given was performed using CD44 and cytokeratin-19. Besides Dukes stage, multivariate analysis of all the studied molecular markers showed that patients expressing CD44 and cytokeratin-19 had a significantly reduced relapse-free and poor overall survival. Moreover, patients expressing both these markers (CD44 and cytokeratin-19) had the lowest significant relative risk for developing recurrence than patients with both markers negative when treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy as compared with patients treated with surgery alone. Thus, in patients with colorectal cancer, immunohistochemical localization of CD44 and cytokeratin-19 may be included as a part of routine pathologic evaluation along with conventional prognostic factors."}

Despite limited evidence of its effectiveness, most guidelines recommend colorectal cancer survivors undergo posttreatment surveillance care. This article describes the posttreatment use of colon examinations, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing, and metastatic disease testing among a managed care population. Two hundred fifty-one patients with colorectal cancer enrolled in a managed care organization at diagnosis (1/1/90-12/31/95) and treated with curative intent. Patients were identified via a Cancer Registry maintained by a large group practice. Cumulative incidences of service receipt were estimated using actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) survival analyses. Co- Proportional Hazard Models were used to evaluate the relation of patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to service receipt. Average 8-year medical care expenditures were calculated. Within 18 months of treatment, 55% of the cohort received a colon examination, 71% received CEA testing, and 59% received metastatic disease testing. Whites were more likely than minorities to receive CEA testing (RR = 1.47, P = 0.04) and tended to be more likely to receive a colon examination (RR = 1.43, P = 0.09). As the median household income of a patient's zip code of residence increased, so too did the likelihood of colon examination and metastatic disease testing receipt (RR = 1.09, P = 0.03 and RR = 1.12, P <0.01, respectively). Average 8-year medical care expenditures among the cohort were $30,247. Among a population with financial access to care, differences were found in the receipt of colorectal cancer surveillance care by race and income. Additional investigations are needed to understand why minorities and those residing in low-income areas are less likely to receive surveillance care."}

CEA mRNA was measured by means of RT-PCR amplification as an indicator for micrometastatic malignant cells. Seven of twenty-nine respectable gastric cancer patients (24.1%) [EGC: 2/9 (22.2%), AGC IIIa: 1/5 (20.0%), AGC IIIb: 4/15 (26.6%)] were positive for CEA mRNA on the initial test and 10 of 29 patients (34.4%) [EGC: 2/ 9 (22.2%), AGC IIIa: 1/5 (20.0%), AGC IIIb: 7/15 (46.7%)] were positive on a follow-up test. Only in AGC IIIb, the positive rate for CEA mRNA increased about twice and 6 of 7 positive cases (85.7%) relapsed within 2.6+/-2.4 months after the follow-up test.

These results suggest that an early tumor cell dissemination may occur in gastrointestinal tract cancer without subsequent relapse, however, the serial regular examination of CEA mRNA level may contribute to predicting a subsequent relapse in AGC IIIb in gastric cancer."}

There have been contradictory reports on the benefit of CEA and CA 19-9 measurements in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer using palliative chemotherapy. The object of this study was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of monitoring of palliative chemotherapy by means of CEA and CA 19-9. The tumour markers CEA and CA 19-9 were subjected to serial measurement in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (n = 90) using palliative first-line chemotherapy with weekly 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU with FA and were compared with objective response according to WHO criteria. 85 patients could be evaluated. 43 patients (51%) initially had elevated CEA (> or = 10 ng/ml) and 33 patients (39%) elevated CA19-9 (> or = 50 IE/ml). In 24 patients (28%), both markers were initially increased. With CEA positive patients, 143 cycles of chemotherapy were carried out, which showed the following response in the various cycles: 21 episodes with progressions (ePD), 69 episodes with no change (eNC), 53 episodes with partial/complete remission (ePR/eCR). With CA 19-9 positive patients, 100 cycles of chemotherapy were carried out with the following results: 21 episodes with progressions (ePD), 48 episodes with eNC, and 31 episodes with ePR/eCR. A CEA rise by at least 50% differentiated between ePD versus eNC/ePR/eCR with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 90%. With CEA decreases of at least 30% in 99% of these patient episodes (78 of 79), a tumour progression could be excluded. Patients with an initial drop in CEA after the first cycle of chemotherapy of at least 50% of the initial level had a significantly higher probability of achieving an ePR/eCR in further therapy (relative risk 2.9; P = 0.002). With an CA 19-9 increase of at least 30%, a sensitivity progression of 62% and a specifity of 90% could be calculated. A CA 19-9 decrease of at least 60% excludes a progression in 95% of the patient episodes. A CEA or CA 19-9 rise is only conditionally appropriate for recording progressions. A progression however, can be excluded with falling levels with high diagnostic accuracy, in which CEA offers a greater degree of certainty than CA 19-9. With a drop in CEA 79 of 143 (= 55%) of the CT scans could be saved, in which case 78 of 79 patient episodes (99%) were correctly assessed as 'no progression'. In patients with an increased CEA and CA 19-9 the CEA determination is sufficient for the further monitoring. A confirmation of these results by multicenter trials can result in a considerable decrease of monitoring costs for palliative treatment."}

The median interval between colorectal resection and lung resection (disease-free interval [DFI]) was 33 months. Overall, 5-year survival was 48%. Five-year survival was 51% for patients with solitary metastasis (n = 30), 47% for patients with ipsilateral multiple metastases (n = 11), and 50% for patients with bilateral metastases (n = 6), and there were no significant differences.

Five-year survival for 11 patients with normal prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels was 70%, and that for 26 patients with elevated prethoracotomy CEA levels (> 5 ng/mL) was 36% (p < 0.05). Eight patients had extrathoracic disease. The median survival time after pulmonary resection was 18.5 months, and the 5-year survival was 60%. A second resection for recurrent metastases was performed in five patients, and a third resection was done in one patient. All six patients are alive. The median survival of five patients who underwent a second thoracotomy was 22 months (range, 2 to 68 months), and one patient is alive 39 months after the third resection. Pulmonary resection for metastases from colorectal cancer may help prolong survival in selected patients, even with bilateral lesions, recurrent metastasectomy, or extrathoracic disease.

Preoperative serum levels of sialyl Lewis(a) (CA 19-9), sialyl Lewis(x) (SLX), and sialyl Tn (STN) antigens in colorectal cancer patients were examined to establish predictive factors for serum levels of these antigens compared with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). A total of 308 patients who underwent resection for a colorectal cancer were divided into low and high antigen groups (higher or lower than a selected diagnostic-based cutoff value). The cutoff values were 37 U/ml for CA19-9, 38 U/ml for SLX, 45 U/ml for STN, and 2.5 ng/ml for CEA. The American Joint Committee on Cancer Classification and Stage grouping was used to classify the tumors. Statistical tests were conducted using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. For CA19-9, 81 patients (26.3%) were assigned to the high antigen group: for SLX, 39 (12.7%); for STN, 33 (10.7%); and for CEA, 133 (43.2%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that predictive factors associated with high antigen levels were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.78 vs male sex), T4 (OR, 3.26 vs T1/T2), and M1 (OR, 3.35 vs M0) for CA19-9; M1 (OR, 6.40 vs M0) for SLX; mucinous carcinoma (OR, 8.45 vs well differentiated adenocarcinoma) and M1 (OR, 8.24 vs M0) for STN; and mucinous carcinoma (OR, 7.21 vs well differentiated adenocarcinoma), T3/T4 (OR, 3.84/4.18, respectively, vs T1/T2), and M1 (OR, 6.39 vs M0) for CEA. In conclusion, high serum levels of CA19-9, SLX, and STN are strongly associated with distant metastasis. In addition, high serum levels of CA19-9 may be an independent predictor for female gender and T4, and high serum levels of STN may be an independent predictor for mucinous carcinoma."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the most widely used tumor markers worldwide. Its main application is mostly in gastrointestinal cancers, especially in colorectal malignancy. Although in use for almost 30 years, the clinical value of CEA in colorectal cancer is still not clear. The literature relevant to the clinical value of CEA in colorectal cancer was reviewed. Particular attention was paid to studies involving metaanalyses and guidelines issued by Expert Panels. Although of little use in detecting early colorectal cancer, high preoperative concentrations of CEA correlate with adverse prognosis. Serial CEA measurements can detect recurrent colorectal cancer with a sensitivity of approximately 80%, a specificity of approximately 70%, and can provide a lead time of approximately 5 months. CEA is the most frequent indicator of recurrence in asymptomatic patients and currently is the most cost-effective test for the preclinical detection of resectable disease. CEA is most useful for the early detection of liver metastasis in patients with diagnosed colorectal cancer. Overall, however, little evidence is available that monitoring of all patients with diagnosed colorectal cancer leads to enhanced patient outcome or quality of life. Currently, the most useful application of CEA is in the detection of liver metastasis from colorectal cancers. Because of the relative success of surgery in resecting hepatic metastases, serial determinations of the marker are recommended for detecting cancer spread to the liver. In the future, preoperative concentrations of CEA may be included with the standard staging procedures for assessing prognosis."}

Based on documented practice on the part of surgeons, this regimen would be regarded as intensive. Analyses of relapses following adjuvant therapy support an even more aggressive schedule, with the goal of maximizing the proportion of patients who may be operated on with curative intent (currently about 20% of those who relapse). Additional considerations that may influence the approach to such patients include the identification of second primary tumors (2% over 7 years observation), and the known improvement in quality of life and survival associated with early versus delayed initiation of chemotherapy.

This case reports an unusual site of solitary metastasis in colorectal cancer and supports the further investigation of positron emission tomography in follow-up of colorectal cancer."}

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen is used mainly for tumor follow-up to detect recurrence of colonic cancer. However, raised preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels may be helpful for the identification of understaged cases and of patients meriting more intensive preoperative and postoperative diagnostic workup. From a prospectively collected database, the data on 261 patients who had curative colonic carcinoma with a minimal follow-up of five years and who had preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels assessed were retrieved and analyzed. Outcome parameters were local and/or distant recurrence and time to recurrence. These parameters were correlated with Dukes staging and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels. The cumulative disease-free survival of patients with a preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level within the normal range was significantly better than that of those whose carcinoembryonic antigen was 5 ng/ml or more (P = 0.001). No patient with carcinoembryonic antigen levels less than 1 ng/ml developed metastatic recurrence. Twenty-three percent of all patients with a raised carcinoembryonic antigen above 5 ng/ml compared with 2.1 percent of patients with carcinoembryonic antigen below 5 ng/ml developed a metastasis at two years. At five years, these figures were 37.2 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively. Dukes staging and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were found to be directly correlated (P < 0.001) when all patients were included. Carcinoembryonic antigen of more of 15 ng/ml was found to be a significant adverse prognostic indicator for disease-free survival irrespective of Dukes staging (P < 0.02). Raised carcinoembryonic antigen levels predicted distant metastatic recurrence (P < 0.001) but did not predict local recurrence (P = 0.72). High preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels above 15 ng/ml predicted an increased risk of metastatic recurrence in potentially curative colonic cancer and may indicate undetectable disseminated disease. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels predict understaging and the possibility of distant recurrence. Such patients may therefore be selected for adjuvant therapy where indicated. Therefore, carcinoembryonic antigen is complementary to conventional Dukes staging for the prediction of recurrence and survival."}

To determine whether the use of [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) in addition to computed axial tomography (CT) is helpful in managing recurrent colorectal cancer (CRC). There is no consensus on a management algorithm for CRC. However, when recurrence is suspected, CT is generally used for further evaluation and staging of disease. The authors used decision trees based on theoretical models to assess the cost-effectiveness of a CT + FDG PET strategy for the diagnosis and management of recurrent CRC compared with a CT-alone strategy. These theoretical models focus on patients with hepatic recurrence who are potentially curable through surgical hepatic resection. The population entering the decision trees consisted of patients with CRC who had undergone surgical resection of their primary CRC and who were suspected of having recurrence based on elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen. The CT + FDG PET strategy was found to be cost-effective for managing patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels who were candidates for hepatic resection. The CT + FDG PET strategy was higher in mean cost by $429 per patient but resulted in an increase in the mean life expectancy of 9.527 days per patient. These results show, through rigorous decision tree analysis, the potential cost-effectiveness of FDG PET in the management of recurrent CRC. The decision trees can be used to model various features of the management of recurrent CRC, including the cost-effectiveness of other newly emerging technologies."}

After curative resection of hepatic colorectal metastases, 10-20% of patients experience a resectable hepatic recurrence. We wanted to assess the expected risk-to-benefit ratio in comparison to first hepatectomy and to determine the prognostic factors associated with survival. Twenty-nine patients from a group of 152 patients resected for colorectal liver metastases underwent 32 repeat hepatectomies. In-hospital mortality was 3.5% (1/29 patients); the morbidity after repeat hepatectomy was lower than that after first hepatic resection. Combined extrahepatic surgery was performed on 34.5% of repeat hepatectomies vs. 6.9% of first hepatectomies (P = 0.01). Overall actuarial 3-year survival was 35.1%: four patients have survived more than 3 years and one survived for more than 5 years. The number of hepatic metastases and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels were significant prognostic factors on univariate analysis. The synchronous resection of hepatic and extrahepatic disease was not associated with a lower survival rate when compared with that of patients without extrahepatic localization: three patients of the former group are alive and disease-free at more than 2 years. Repeat hepatic resection can provide long-term survival rates similar to those of first liver resection, with comparable mortality and morbidity. The presence of resectable extrahepatic disease must not be an absolute contraindication to synchronous hepatectomy because long-term survival is possible."}

The value of endorectal ultrasound (EUS) in the diagnosis of recurrent rectal cancer is limited by the inability to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. We have prospectively investigated the role of EUS with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in the postoperative follow-up of rectal cancer. Since 1995, patients who had undergone a sphincter-saving operation for rectal cancer (n = 312) were followed-up by a standard program including rectal palpation, carcinoembryonic antigen monitoring, computed tomography, and EUS. Transrectal EUS-guided biopsy of perirectal lesions was performed in 68 patients with perirectal lesions by using a rigid endoprobe with a 10 MHZ multiplane transducer and special targeting device. Overall local recurrence was observed in 36 patients. Intraluminal recurrence was diagnosed by proctoscopy in 12 patients. Transrectal EUS-guided biopsy showed pelvic recurrence in 22 of 68 patients with perirectal lesions. Biopsy specimens with benign histology were obtained from 41 patients, and the procedure failed in 5 cases (accuracy, 92%). There was a strong agreement between transrectal biopsy results and the final diagnosis (kappa = 0.84), the sensitivity and specificity being 91% and 93%, respectively. In contrast, clinical examination (kappa = 0.27), computed tomography (kappa = 0.47), or EUS (kappa = 0.42) showed only a moderate level of agreement with the histopathologic diagnosis, mainly because of the limited specificity of all 3 methods (65% vs 46% vs 57%). EUS-guided biopsy was significantly more accurate than computed tomography and EUS (P <.01). The biopsy results had a considerable impact on the management in 18 of 68 patients (26%). Transrectal EUS-guided biopsy is a safe and efficient method for tissue sampling of perirectal lesions. This minimally invasive and inexpensive technique improves the accuracy of endorectal ultrasound in the diagnosis of recurrent rectal cancer."}

This study investigated the prognostic significance of a preoperative and postoperative APPR in relation to disease-specific mortality rate. Some 202 patients with colorectal cancer were followed for at least 5 years. C-reactive protein concentration, measured before and at 3 months after operation, was used as an index of the APPR. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on a number of potential prognostic factors. Thirty-six per cent of patients had an APPR and this was associated with a higher rate of local tumour invasion, fewer curative resections and a higher carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration. There was no difference in Dukes' stage between patients with or without an APPR. The most important prognostic factor related to both disease-specific and crude survival was Duke's stage (P < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that APPR had prognostic significance only in patients with advanced disease (P = 0.013). An APPR was present in a minority of patients (11 per cent) after operation and was not associated with increased likelihood of tumour recurrence. The APPR is increased in more than a third of patients presenting with colorectal cancer and is associated with more frequent local tumour invasion, fewer curative resections and a higher CEA level. An APPR at 3 months after operation does not have the prognostic significance reported by earlier studies."}

Follow-up consisted of interim history, physical examination, liver ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, chest radiography and colonoscopy. Two hundred and thirteen patients had recurrent disease (median follow-up 43 months). Forty-two patients with recurrence (20 per cent) were treated with curative intent (median survival 38 months; 5-year survival rate 40 per cent).

Our CK19 mRNA assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect one SK-BR-3 cell among 10(6) normal blood cells. The upper limit of CK19 mRNA among controls was exceeded by 14 patients, and 12 patients (86%) developed systemic metastases/recurrence. Significantly elevated CK19 mRNA levels appeared to originate from circulating malignant cells (P<0.0001). Of relevance, the CK19 mRNA level increased with advancing Dukes' stage and correlated directly with the serum CEA level (P=0.016).

It is also present in a variety of benign and non-neoplastic diseases like ulcerative colitis, Adenomatous polyp, Liver cirrhosis and other cancers like GI tract tumors, Cancer of the breast, lung, ovary, pancreas, prostate, hepatoma etc. Elevated CEA levels serve as clinical tool in the diagnosis, monitoring, detecting early any recurrence or metastasis and in prognostication for confirmed colorectal cancers. In order to develop an Enzyme Immuno Assay and immunocytochemical assay for CEA, an MAb designated as CIBCHTB1 has been generated using CEA isolated from a cell line HT115, human adenocarcinoma of the colon, as immunogen by the conventional Hybridoma technology. This MAb of IgG1 isotope was selected by screening of culture supernatents by ELISA and then by its high binding affinity with HT115 cells as revealed by flowcytometric analysis. By ABC method of immunocytochemical assay, this Ab exhibited strong staining of cells in frozen tissue sections of normal colon and malignant colorectal lesions and various other types of human cancers. This MAb has useful application to study the expression of CEA in human cancers. Serum CEA levels of patients with colorectal cancers and other CEA producing cancers and controls determined by EIA using this MAb were in good correlation with the results obtained using commercial kit. The diagnostic potential of this Mab in the management of colorectal cancers is discussed."}

They also considered the dependence of the results of these data analyses on the definition of groups of patients, both with no evidence of disease (NED) and with recurrence of disease (RD). From January 1994 to March 1999 serum levels of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 were determined in the follow-up of 517 patients with colorectal cancer and compared with the retrospectively confirmed clinical status of the patients. CEA and CA19-9 showed comparable sensitivities in the detection of locoregional recurrence of colorectal carcinoma, whilst the sensitivity of CA72-4 was considerably lower. CEA is an optimal marker for detecting distant metastases, in particular liver metastases, since its sensitivity considerably exceeds the sensitivities of the other two monitored markers. Using routine data required detailed analysis and clear definitions of groups of patients with NED and RD. The following conclusions for the evaluation of data were drawn from this analysis: a) Tumor marker cut-off values and sensitivities related to 95% specificity of remission values depended strongly on the given definition of the groups of patients with NED and RD. b) The patient group with NED is best characterized as the group of patients who never developed progression and where all the values which were assessed within a period shorter than six months from the end of therapy and follow-up, or less than six months before progression, death, or before the last marker assessment in the patient, were excluded. c) For the optimal characterisation of the group of patients with RD it is recommended only to consider values obtained during the first progression, after the period of complete post-operative or post-therapeutic remission. d) These conclusions refer not only to routine data, where this correction represents a condition for reliable evaluation, but also to any research done, since they ensure complete homogeneity of the group and mutual comparability of the results."}

Therapy for patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) remains controversial and may be improved by regional oxaliplatin which proved to be effective when administered systemically to patients with advanced CRC. During the current study, which aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the dose-limiting toxicity, and the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin applied as hepatic intra-arterial infusion combined with folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil in patients with hepatic metastases from CRC, serial levels of carcino-embryonic antigen were determined and their relationship to response to therapy was assessed. Toxicity mainly consisted of nausea, pain, mucositis, sensorial neuropathy, diarrhoea, and thrombocytopenia. The results of tumor marker analyses suggest that progressive disease may be detected early by increasing CEA levels and responsive disease may be characterized by low or decreasing values. Further analyses are warranted to determine the role of CEA in the assessment of response as compared to imaging techniques."}

Between 1990 and 1998 follow-up CEA levels of 1,321 patients after curative colorectal cancer resection were prospectively collected in cooperation with family physicians, CEA determinations were made with different assays by various laboratories. The reported findings were adjusted for the different methods used. 306 patients developed recurrent disease following curative cancer resection (23.2% of all patients). Regarding the role of follow-up CEA determination, they were divided into: I. no preoperative CEA determination/insufficient follow-up (N = 47); II. no elevation of CEA with primary cancer, a) elevation with recurrent disease (N = 62), b) no elevation at any time point (N = 53), c) role of CEA not completely elucidated (N = 41); III. elevated CEA levels with primary cancer, a) no increase with recurrent disease (N = 21), b) increase with other symptoms of recurrent disease (N = 45), c) increased levels as early symptom of recurrent disease (N = 37). 30 patients (9.8% of all patients with recurrent disease; 2.3% of all patients) with increased CEA levels at the time of recurrent disease underwent surgical resection with curative intention (R0 resection). Our findings indicate that up to 47% of the patients with recurrent disease and 11% of all patients (N = 144, groups IIa + IIIb + IIIc) could benefit from routine follow-up CEA determinations after curative colorectal cancer resection. Nonetheless, only 2.3% of all patients with elevated CEA levels underwent R0 resection of recurrent disease.

The recommended surgical procedure for resectable colon cancer is an en bloc resection; laparoscopic surgery should be done only in the context of a clinical trial. For patients with stage III disease, 5-FU-based adjuvant therapy is recommended. A patient who has metastatic disease in the liver or lung should be considered for surgical resection if he or she is a candidate for surgery and if surgery can extend survival. Surgery should be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The panel advocates a conservative post-treatment surveillance program for colon and rectal carcinoma patients. Serial CEA determinations are appropriate if the patient is a candidate for aggressive surgical resection, should recurrence be detected. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans should be utilized only when there are clinical indications of possible recurrence. Patients whose disease progresses during 5-FU-based therapy should be treated with irinotecan or encouraged to participate in a phase I or phase II clinical trial."}

It was also of interest to assess whether this test, in combination with standard monitoring procedures used in an intensive surveillance plan, can result in the identification of surgically salvageable patients. Forty consecutive resected Dukes' B and C rectal cancer patients underwent a prospective, single-institution, surveillance trial of physical examination (including digital rectal examination), endoscopy, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, liver ultrasound, chest x-ray, blood CEA, and CEA immunoscintigraphy with arcitumomab (CEA-Scan, Immunomedics, Morris Plains, NJ) every 6 months for the first 2 years and every 12 months for the next 3 years after initial operation. Outcomes were compared with those from a similar group of 69 patients treated previously at the same institution but without CEA imaging. A total of 219 CEA imaging studies were performed without any significant adverse effects or immune responses, and resulted in lesion sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of 94.1%, 97.5%, 97.3%, 76.2%, and 99.5%, respectively. Of the 40 patients, 16 developed 22 surgically confirmed local or distant recurrences, and CEA imaging correctly disclosed 82% of these lesions pre-operatively. All of the patients found to have recurrences had at least one tumor site by CEA imaging; only 6 of 16 had elevated blood CEA titers. On a patient-basis, there was a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 79.2%, an accuracy of 87.5%, and positive and negative predictive values of 76.2% and 100%, respectively. The potential therapeutic benefit of serial arcitumomab imaging is suggested by the fact that 6 of 16 patients (37.5%) with recurrence underwent potentially curative second-look operations, compared with 6 of 69 (8.7%) of a comparable population studied at this institution during an earlier 6-year period, using all of the same tests except CEA imaging. None of the patients in this historic control group survived more than 21 months, although the mean survival of the six patients resected for cure in the study population was 35 months (range 11 to 69 months). During 6 years of followup, three of the six re-resected patients eventually died of cancer recurrence, two died from other causes (and were confirmed by necropsy to be tumor-free), and one patient is still free of disease in the sixth year. CEA scanning appeared to be more predictive of recurrence than blood CEA testing or other diagnostic modalities. Arcitumomab inclusion in intensive surveillance of patients with resected rectal cancer can disclose tumor recurrence at a stage that allowed surgical salvage therapy in 37.5% of the 16 patients with recurrence who had second-look surgery, and in 19% the patients were free of disease during longterm followup. This pilot study suggests that a randomized prospective trial comparing standard surveillance procedures to the use of CEA imaging added thereto should be undertaken."}

From these PS, CEA, number of sites and response to first-line chemotherapy were used to develop a nomogram capable of predicting the probability of survival beyond 2 years for an individual patient. This large study confirmed the relevance of known prognostic factors in metastatic colorectal cancer and demonstrated the importance of response to chemotherapy as an independent factor to predict LS.

Comparisons were made with 57 individuals who had a normal colonoscopy (controls). Serial changes were examined in 27 cases. As IGF-related peptides are age- and sex-dependent, absolute concentrations were converted to standard deviation scores (SDS). Mean IGF-II SDS were elevated in Dukes A (n = 12, P< 0.001) and Dukes B (n = 25, P< 0.001) cases compared with controls, but not in advanced disease.

Furthermore, IGFBP-2 SDS were positively related to tumour size (P = 0.01) and fell significantly in patients following curative resection (P = 0.04), suggesting that circulating levels reflect tumour load. We tested the potential tumour marker characteristics of IGFBP-2 SDS against three endpoints: metastasis alone; local pelvic recurrence alone; and metastasis and recurrence combined. The sensitivities for IGFBP-2 alone (>/= + 2SD) were modest at 55%, 46%, and 52%, but in combination with CEA, increased substantially to 90%, 77% and 86%, respectively. We conclude that the serum IGF-II and IGFBP-2 profiles may provide insights into underlying biological mechanisms, and that serum IGFBP-2 may have an adjunct role in cancer surveillance in patients with colorectal cancer."}

Traditional surgical exploration identified 26 recurrent tumors: 7 hepatic, 8 pelvic, 6 retroperitoneal, 3 colonic, 1 splenic, and 1 anastomotic. Radioimmunoguided surgical exploration confirmed all recurrent tumors and identified additional tumor sites in seven patients that resulted in changing the surgical plan. CEA scans correlated with intraabdominal findings in seven patients. Abdominal pathology did not correlate completely with the scans in three patients, and CEA scan results were undetermined in two patients. Patients with elevated CEA and no other findings should be operated upon without delay, and radioimmunoguided surgery should be used to enhance the surgeon's knowledge of the extent of disease."}

We present herein the case of a sclerosing hemangioma of the liver which was extremely difficult to differentiate from liver metastasis of rectal cancer, in a 67-year-old woman. All the radiological findings were compatible with liver metastasis; however, marginal pooling of the tumor revealed by computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance imaging scans was inconsistent with a diagnosis of liver metastasis. At laparotomy, the tumor was macroscopically unusual in that it was yellowish elastic-hard with a very clear margin, and thus, it did not have the appearance of a metastatic tumor. Mile's operation and a partial hepatectomy were performed, followed by an uneventful postoperative course and no signs of recurrence. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in the peripheral blood was not elevated at any time. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was a rare hepatic tumor, namely, a \"sclerosing hemangioma,\" based on the findings of cellular fibrous stroma containing vascular channels with flattened endothelial cells. Preoperatively differentiating between sclerosing hemangioma and a metastatic liver tumor from colorectal cancer may be very difficult; however, this case demonstrated some interesting characteristics, namely, the serum CEA level was not elevated, marginal pooling of the tumor was found in the enhanced radiological findings, and the tumor was macroscopically unusual. Therefore, the possibility of sclerosing hemangioma should be borne in mind when considering the differential diagnosis of patients suspected of having colorectal liver metastasis. A preoperative biopsy should be carried out and when a laparotomy is performed under the misdiagnosis of colorectal liver metastasis, it is advisable that either an intraoperative needle biopsy or a frozen histological analysis be undertaken to avoid unnecessary extended hepatic resection of this rare benign hepatic tumor."}

The aim of this study was to compare FDG PET with a new monoclonal antibody-based imaging agent that comprises an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody Fab' fragment directly labeled with 99mTc. Twenty-eight patients who were previously treated for colorectal carcinoma and in whom recurrence was suspected were examined with FDG PET and immunoscintigraphy. The most common indications were an elevation of serum CEA (13 patients), suggestive lesions documented by CT (9 patients), sonography (4 patients), and severe constipation (2 patients). Planar imaging and SPECT were performed 4-6 h after intravenous injection of the new imaging agent. Whole-body PET was performed 45-60 min after intravenous injection of FDG. The findings were confirmed by conventional diagnostic modalities, surgery, and histology. Histology confirmed local tumor recurrence in 9 of 28 patients. Clinical follow-up or CT confirmed the presence of liver metastases in 9 patients and lymph node involvement, lung metastases, and bone metastases in 2 patients each. The new agent correctly detected 8 of 9 local recurrences, whereas FDG PET was able to detect all 9 cases and in 1 case was false-positive. Liver metastases were confirmed in 9 patients by FDG PET but in only 1 patient by the new agent. Two cases with lymph node metastases and 2 cases with lung metastases were correctly identified by FDG PET, but none were detected by the new agent. Finally, bone metastases were identified in 1 patient by FDG PET but not with the new agent, whereas bone marrow infiltration (n = 1) was diagnosed by both imaging modalities. These results indicate that FDG PET and 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA Fab' are suitable for the diagnosis of local recurrence of colorectal carcinoma but that FDG PET is clearly superior in the detection of distant metastases (liver, bone, and lung) and lymph node involvement."}

CD26 is an ectoenzyme with dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity expressed on a variety of cell types. Although the function of the high concentration of serum-soluble CD26 (sCD26) is unknown, it may be related to the cleavage of biologically active polypeptides. As CD26 or enzymatic activity levels were previously associated with cancer, we examined the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of preoperative sCD26 measurements by ELISA in colorectal carcinoma patients. We found a highly significant difference between sCD26 levels in healthy donors (mean 559.7 +/- 125.5 microg l(-1)) and cancer patients (mean 261.7 +/- 138.1 microg l(-1)) (P< 0.001). A cut-off at 410 microg l(-1)gave 90% sensitivity with 90% specificity which means that the diagnostic efficiency of sCD26 is higher than that shown by other markers, particularly in patients at early stages. Moreover, sCD26 as a variable is not related with Dukes' stage classification, age, gender, tumour location or degree of differentiation. With a follow-up of 2 years until recurrence, preliminary data show that sCD26 can be managed as a prognostic variable of early carcinoma patients. In addition, the origin of sCD26 is discussed."}

The validity of mass screening using fecal occult blood testing remains controversial. In addition, no controlled clinical study has yet been performed to show the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy. The purpose of the present study was to compare the surgical results achieved in asymptomatic patients with colorectal cancer detected by screening with those in symptomatic individuals. A total of 285 patients underwent a surgical resection of colorectal cancer between 1991 and 1997 at our institution. Among them, 233 patients had complaints related to cancer at the time of diagnosis. In contrast, 52 were asymptomatic. In those 52 patients, colorectal cancer had been suspected based on routine screening including fecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy and/or elevated serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen. Early stage of colorectal cancer was more frequently seen in asymptomatic patients than in symptomatic patients P < 0.01. The survival rates for asymptomatic patients was also superior to those of symptomatic patients P < 0.05. Screening using fecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy and tumor markers is thus considered to be beneficial for the early detection of colorectal carcinoma, which also tends to demonstrate good surgical results."}

Detection of free cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity by RT-PCR using carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a target gene is a more sensitive predictor of peritoneal dissemination than conventional cytology in gastric-cancer patients. Difficulties with this method are the lack of quantitative assessment of free cancer cells and the length of time before completion. To overcome these problems, we have established a rapid and quantitative detection method using a novel real-time fluorescence PCR system (LightCycler). Using this device with hybridization probes as fluorophores, we detected CEA mRNA in peritoneal washes during surgery (within 3 hr) without any post-PCR procedure. This method could reproducibly quantitate 10 to 10(6) CEA-expressing colon carcinoma cells per 10(7) peripheral blood leukocytes, a comparable sensitivity to conventional RT-PCR with a wide dynamic range. Analysis of peritoneal washes from 109 gastric-cancer patients with this assay revealed relative values of CEA transcripts that correlated well with the depth of tumor invasion (p < 0.01). Average values of CEA transcript in peritoneal washes in patients with cytology (-)/RT-PCR(-), cytology (-)/RT-PCR(+) and cytology (+)/RT-PCR(+) results were 0.64, 1,525 and 6,715, respectively. Moreover, CEA transcripts in peritoneal washes in patients with synchronous peritoneal metastasis were more than 50-fold higher than in those without metastasis. These results suggest a positive correlation between CEA mRNA levels in peritoneal washes and prognosis. We conclude that real-time RT-PCR with hybridization probes is a sensitive, quantitative, specific and rapid method to detect free cancer cells in peritoneal washes. This clinically relevant system is a powerful technique to evaluate the risk of peritoneal recurrence in patients with gastric cancer."}

The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of bile carcinoembryonic antigen levels taken at the time of operation in predicting patients with occult hepatic metastases. Bile and serum carcinoembryonic antigen samples were collected from 37 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer, 26 of whose procedures were deemed curative and who were followed up for a median of 63.5 months. Twelve patients were alive with no evidence of recurrent disease, and two had recurrent disease, whereas 12 died of disease. The median (interquartile range) serum carcinoembryonic antigen in the disease-free group was 2.8 (1.1-6.1) ng/ml, and in the recurrent group it was 6.35 (4.3-30) ng/ml (P = 0.006), whereas bile carcinoembryonic antigen in the disease-free group was 7 (5-39) ng/ml as compared with 31 (5-383.7) ng/ml in the recurrent group (P = 0.210). The accuracy of serum carcinoembryonic antigen in predicting occult hepatic metastases was 77 percent compared with 72 percent for bile carcinoembryonic antigen.

During recent years, a discussion about cost-effectiveness and importance of follow-up evaluation after curative resection of large-bowel cancer has developed. It is not known whether the determination of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) plays a crucial role in the early detection of recurrent disease. We conducted an analysis of the prospective follow-up database of 1321 patients after curative resection of colorectal cancer in our institution between 1990 and 1998 to evaluate the role of CEA in the early detection of recurrent disease. Of the 1321 patients included in our study, 306 developed recurrent disease following curative resection (23.2%). These patients with recurrent disease were divided into: Group I. No pre-operative CEA determination/insufficient follow-up (n=47; 15.4%). Group II. No elevation of CEA with primary cancer (n=156; 51.0%): (IIa) elevation with recurrent disease (n=62); (IIb) no elevation at any time point (n=53); and (IIc) role of CEA not completely elucidated (n=41). Thirteen patients of group II underwent curative relapse surgery (8.3%). Group III. Elevated CEA with primary cancer (n=103; 33.7%): (IlIa) no increase with recurrent disease (n=21); (IIIb) increase with other symptoms of recurrent disease (n=45); and (IIIc) increased values as an early symptom of recurrent disease (n=37). Sixteen patients of group III underwent curative relapse surgery (15.5%). In patients after relapse surgery, recurrent disease developed again after a median time of 12 months (mean 17.9+/-3.8 months). Our findings indicate that 2.8% of all patients (12.1% of patients with recurrent disease) who underwent curative resection of colorectal cancer profit from follow-up CEA determinations. With careful observation of CEA kinetics, 6.2% (n=82) of all patients or 26.8% of patients with recurrent disease could profit from routine follow-up CEA determinations. In 9.5% of patients with recurrent disease, curative resection of relapse was achieved and these patients remained disease free for a median time of 12 months. Regular CEA measurements remain an important part of routine patient care after curative resection of colorectal cancer."}

College of American Pathologists Consensus Statement 1999. Under the auspices of the College of American Pathologists, the current state of knowledge regarding pathologic prognostic factors (factors linked to outcome) and predictive factors (factors predicting response to therapy) in colorectal carcinoma was evaluated. A multidisciplinary group of clinical (including the disciplines of medical oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology), pathologic, and statistical experts in colorectal cancer reviewed all relevant medical literature and stratified the reported prognostic factors into categories that reflected the strength of the published evidence demonstrating their prognostic value. Accordingly, the following categories of prognostic factors were defined. Category I includes factors definitively proven to be of prognostic import based on evidence from multiple statistically robust published trials and generally used in patient management. Category IIA includes factors extensively studied biologically and/or clinically and repeatedly shown to have prognostic value for outcome and/or predictive value for therapy that is of sufficient import to be included in the pathology report but that remains to be validated in statistically robust studies. Category IIB includes factors shown to be promising in multiple studies but lacking sufficient data for inclusion in category I or IIA. Category III includes factors not yet sufficiently studied to determine their prognostic value. Category IV includes factors well studied and shown to have no prognostic significance. The medical literature was critically reviewed, and the analysis revealed specific points of variability in approach that prevented direct comparisons among published studies and compromised the quality of the collective data. Categories of variability recognized included the following: (1) methods of analysis, (2) interpretation of findings, (3) reporting of data, and (4) statistical evaluation. Additional points of variability within these categories were defined from the collective experience of the group. Reasons for the assignment of an individual prognostic factor to category I, II, III, or IV (categories defined by the level of scientific validation) were outlined with reference to the specific types of variability associated with the supportive data. For each factor and category of variability related to that factor, detailed recommendations for improvement were made. The recommendations were based on the following aims: (1) to increase the uniformity and completeness of pathologic evaluation of tumor specimens, (2) to enhance the quality of the data needed for definitive evaluation of the prognostic value of individual prognostic factors, and (3) ultimately, to improve patient care. Factors that were determined to merit inclusion in category I were as follows: the local extent of tumor assessed pathologically (the pT category of the TNM staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer [AJCC/UICC]); regional lymph node metastasis (the pN category of the TNM staging system); blood or lymphatic vessel invasion; residual tumor following surgery with curative intent (the R classification of the AJCC/UICC staging system), especially as it relates to positive surgical margins; and preoperative elevation of carcinoembryonic antigen elevation (a factor established by laboratory medicine methods rather than anatomic pathology). Factors in category IIA included the following: tumor grade, radial margin status (for resection specimens with nonperitonealized surfaces), and residual tumor in the resection specimen following neoadjuvant therapy (the ypTNM category of the TNM staging system of the AJCC/UICC).

This study evaluated the vaccine ALVAC-CEA B7.1, a canary pox virus that has been engineered to encode the gene for the tumor-associated antigen carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and B7.1, a T-cell costimulatory molecule. Patients with CEA-expressing tumors were immunized with 2.5 x 10(7) (n = 3), 1.0 x 10(8) (n = 6), and 4.5 x 10(8) (n = 30) plaque-forming units intradermally every other week for 8 weeks. Patients with stable or responding disease received monthly boost injections. Biopsies of vaccine sites were obtained 48 h after vaccination to evaluate leukocytic infiltration and CEA expression. Induction of CEA-specific T-cell precursors was assessed by an ELISPOT assay looking for the production of IFN-gamma. Therapy was well tolerated, without significant toxicity attributable to vaccine. All patients had evidence of leukocytic infiltration and CEA expression in vaccine biopsy sites. Six patients with elevated serum CEA values at baseline had declines in their levels lasting 4-12 weeks. These patients all had stable disease after four vaccinations. After four vaccinations, patients who were HLA-A-2-positive demonstrated increases in their CEA-specific T-cell precursor frequencies to a CEA-A2-binding peptide from baseline. The number of prior chemotherapy regimens was inversely correlated with the ability to generate a T-cell response. ALVAC-CEA B7.1 is safe in patients with advanced, recurrent adenocarcinomas that express CEA, and it is associated with the induction of a CEA-specific T-cell response."}

Stages II and III rectal tumors are known as locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) because they are characterized by a high incidence of local and distant relapses and a low probability of long-term survival. Adjuvant treatments have been advocated to ameliorate overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) without a univocal beneficial trend. The aim of this study was to identify the independent predictive factors of OS, LRFS, and MFS which could best select patients for adjuvant treatment of LARC. Of 153 rectal cancer cases seen consecutively from 1991 to 1998, we studied the main clinical and pathological parameters of 73 LARCs. Clinical and pathological variables were studied by univariate analysis, and independent predictive factors were identified by multivariate analysis. Stages II and III rectal cancer have shown not statistically different rates of OS, LRFS, and MFS. Factors independently associated with increasing OS and MFS were low preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level (CEA), low number of metastatic lymph nodes, low percentage of metastatic lymph nodes out of the total number of lymph nodes excised, and adjuvant treatment. Increased staging and distal resection margins < or =1 cm were shown to be independent detrimental risk factors regarding OS and MFS, respectively. Independent prognostic factors associated with a reduction in LRFS were advanced age, Hartman's resection, distal resection margins < or =1 cm, and fewer than 14 resected nodes. Whereas stage I rectal cancer can be treated with a good probability of cure by surgery alone, avoiding adverse effects of adjuvant regimens, the outcome of LARC appears to be positively influenced by adjuvant therapies. In LARC, an accurate study of risk factors would be useful to identify which subset of patients could be favorably influenced by postoperative radiochemotherapy."}

We studied which factors controlled the tumor growth rate using modern immunohistochemical methods. In 51 patients who underwent extended resection for this condition, paraffin-embedded specimens were examined for 1) tumor angiogenesis by CD31 staining and microvessel counting, 2) apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end-labeling staining, and 3) cellular proliferative activity using anti-proliferative cell nuclear antigen antibody. The results were compared with carcinoembryonic antigen doubling time and survival. The five-year survival rate was 20 percent. The postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen doubling time, which was the strongest predictor of survival, correlated highly with proliferative cell nuclear antigen labeling index, but did not correlate with the apoptotic index or microvessel counts. Our study shows that cancer cell proliferation rather than apoptosis or angiogenesis is a major determinant of tumor growth rate and survival in patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer."}

Sixty of 151 patients enrolled in the Neo2-14 Phase III study for recurrent colorectal cancer were diagnosed with liver metastases based on preoperative CT. In 17/56 patients (30%), RIGS identified at least one tumor site confirmed by pathology (H&E). This resulted in 16 major changes in surgical plan. RIGS performance varied between lymphatic and non-lymphatic tissue, with positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% for non-lymphoid tissue, compared to PPV of 46.5% and NPV of 100% for the lymphoid tissue.

In localizing patients, no RIGS activity in lymph nodes signifies no tumor, while H&E confirmation is needed for decisions based on RIGS activity in the lymph nodes. RIGS provides important staging information, identifying patients for whom surgery may be done with curative intent."}

Anti-CEA-scintigraphy turned out to be very reliable in detecting primary and recurrent colorectal cancer, its overall accuracy being more than 90%. The intraoperative application of this technology should provide similar results when focussing at extrahepatic tumor deposits, for example in lymph nodes, thus allowing accurate staging of the underlying disease. To test this hypothesis we launched the following feasibility study the results of which are compared to those reported in the recent literature. We investigated 20 patients, six with rectum and 14 with colon cancer. 24 hours before surgery they were intravenously given 1 ml of a fab'-fragment-antibody to CEA, labeled with 25 mCi of 99mTc (CEA-Scan). During surgery the radioactivity in lymph glands regional to the tumors was measured and compared to the much lower activity in healthy nodes. For this we used a scintillation probe (C-Trak, Care Wise, Inc., Morgan Hill, CA). All lymph nodes of interest were then excised and submitted to frozen section pathology. In 7 out of 20 cases scintimetry led to an up-staging of the disease. In addition we found metastatic spread to lymph nodes that were basically not regional to the primary tumor (retroperitoneum, renal hilum etc.). Scintimetry can precisely identify even very small tumor deposits. So it leads to accurate staging while surgery is still ongoing. In a further step the concept of sentinel node diagnosis, which is right now being clinically evaluated, may some day be applied in colorectal surgical oncology."}

In pivotal phase III clinical trials for detecting recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer, most patients received a single arcitumomab injection. However, the early detection of postsurgical recurrence or metastases with arcitumomab will necessitate serial studies for surveillance. We present immunogenicity, safety, and imaging data supporting the use of multiple administrations of arcitumomab. Human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response, adverse events, clinical laboratory values, and diagnostic imaging results were evaluated in 44 patients (24 men, 20 women; age range, 2878 y) after repeated arcitumomab administration (44 second and 3 third injections). Most patients initially had Dukes' class B or C colorectal cancer and had known or occult disease recurrence and elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels at the time of the repeated injection. At the repeated injection, in no patient did elevated HAMA titers develop, hematology and serum chemistry changes were clinically insignificant, and only 1 adverse event (eosinophilia) was judged at least possibly related to arcitumomab. Arcitumomab imaging results at the second injection were comparable with those obtained in phase III trials after a single injection of arcitumomab, having a 78% per-lesion concordance with CT in the abdomen and pelvis and a 73% sensitivity and 94% specificity based on 9 patients with cancer confirmed surgically at 11 anatomic sites and excluded at 16 sites. These data indicate that at least 2 injections of arcitumomab can be given safely to patients with colorectal cancer, without increased immunogenicity and with imaging efficacy equivalent to the first administration."}

In radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS), a radiolabeled antibody is given i.v. before surgery and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe is used to locate tumor in the operative field. The rapid blood clearance and good tumor penetration of single-chain Fv antibodies (scFv) offer potential advantages over larger antibody molecules used previously for RIGS. A Phase I clinical trial is reported on RIGS with scFv (MFE-23-his) to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Thirty-four patients undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma (17 primary tumors, 16 liver metastases, and 1 anastomotic recurrence) and 1 patient with liver metastases of pancreatic carcinoma received 125I-labeled MFE-23-his scFv (125I-MFE-23-his) 24, 48, 72, or 96 h before operation. 125I-MFE-23-his showed biexponential blood clearance with alpha and beta half-lives of 0.32 and 10.95 h, respectively. The abdomen was scanned during surgery with a hand-held gamma detecting probe (Neoprobe Corp.). 125I-MFE-23-his showed good tumor localization; comparison with histology showed overall accuracy of 84%. Highest median ratios for tumor:normal tissue and tumor:blood were recorded 72 or 96 h after scFv injection for patients undergoing resection of liver metastases. High levels of radioactivity were found in the kidneys. Five patients had grade 1 fever, and three had a grade 1 rise in blood pressure according to the Common Toxicity Criteria. There was a significant correlation between these ratios and those measured in excised tissues using a laboratory gamma counter (P < 0.001). MFE-23-his scFv antibody localizes in CEA-producing carcinomas. The short interval between injection and operation, the lack of significant toxicity, and the relatively simple production in bacteria make MFE-23-his scFv suitable for RIGS."}

There has been much progress in the understanding of the relationship between the immune system and colorectal cancer. This has led to the use of immunomodulatory therapy in the adjuvant and palliative treatment of the condition. Although attempts at the use of non-specific immunomodulation with agents such as levamisole, cimetidine, alpha interferon and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) have not produced significant clinical benefits when tested in randomized trials in both the adjuvant setting and for metastatic disease, promising results are being obtained with more specific therapy. Edrecolomab [corrected], a murine monoclonal antibody targeting the 17-1A antigen on malignant colorectal cells has produced a reduction in relapse and mortality rates when used as adjuvant treatment following surgery for Dukes' C colon cancer. Active specific therapy with autologous tumour vaccine administered with BCG has produced similar benefits in Dukes' B cancer. Both 3H1 anti-idiotypic antibody against carcinoembryonic antigen and 105AD7 antibody to gp72 glycoprotein have demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo immune activation against tumour. Non-randomized studies postulate prolongation of survival using these antibodies in advanced disease. These agents are all currently being tested in randomized studies powered to detect meaningful survival differences and clinical benefit. Immune therapy offers the potential of low toxicity therapy in colorectal cancer and may have a role as an adjunct to conventional chemotherapy."}

We report a patient with a carcinoembryonic antigen-producing adenocarcinoma arising within a TGC who underwent resection through a combined anterior laparotomy/posterior pelvic approach. Despite complete resection and delayed but complete functional recovery, diffusely metastatic disease was encountered 6 months after resection. Diagnostic, therapeutic, histopathological, and oncological implications of this illustrative case are discussed. It seems possible to use carcinoembryonic antigen measurements for treatment planning and for assessing treatment response for this rare disease. The described outcome also suggests that TGC can develop malignant degeneration and should be resected at the time of diagnosis."}

Diagnostic imaging for suspected tumour recurrence of primary colorectal cancer frequently lacks specificity and sensitivity. The impact of whole body 18F-FDG-positron-emission tomography (PET) on detection of local recurrences and hepatic or pulmonary metastases was evaluated in a prospective study. Results were compared with computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and conventional chest X-ray. The study included 71 patients (77 investigations) with suspected local recurrence, hepatic metastases or unexplained raised level of the tumour marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The results demonstrate that 18F-FDG-PET was clearly superior to CT with regard to detection of hepatic metastases. Sensitivity was 1.0 and specificity 0.98 compared with 0.87 and 0.91 for CT. In four cases, 18F-FDG-PET clarified otherwise unclear local recurrences. In five patients, 18F-FDG-PET showed pulmonary metastases that had previously been unknown. In a total of 16 patients (20.8%), 18F-FDG-PET provided additional information leading to a change of the treatment strategy. 18F-FDG-PET clearly has the ability to detect colorectal tumour recurrence and its metastases in a whole body format. Therefore, it may be applied in the follow-up of patients with primary colorectal cancer. Despite the costs, it is certainly recommended for patients with an otherwise unclear increase of CEA level or with unproven local recurrence."}

The study aims to evaluate the efficiency of a new monoclonal antibody (IOR-CEA1) labeled with technetium-99m in the detection of colorectal carcinoma. Forty colorectal carcinoma patients were examined. They were divided into 2 groups: Group I (9 patients) with untreated primary tumor; and Group II (31 patients) who were suspected of recurrent or residual diseases from 1) equivocal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, or 2) rising serum carcinoembryonic antigen but normal imaging or clinical findings. One milligram of the antibody labeled with 25mCi of technetium-99m was slowly infused intravenously and images were obtained by nuclear medicine techniques. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values were determined. 99mTc-IOR-CEA1 had 86% sensitivity, 71% specificity, 83% accuracy, 94% positive predictive value and 50% negative predictive value for the detection of colorectal cancer in 42 studies (2 patients had repeated studies). Serum carcinoembryonic antigen had only 33% sensitivity for detection of the primary cancer and 58% sensitivity in detection of recurrent diseases. Carcinoembryonic antigen had 100% positive predictive value but only 31.3% negative predictive value for diagnosis of the recurrence of tumor. Fifty-two percent of the antibody scans provided more information than computed tomography scans with clinical impact on further management in group II patients. The 99mTc-IOR-CEA1 scintigraphy is a promising investigative method which is safe and has high accuracy in the detection of recurrent colorectal carcinoma, especially in the patients whose serum carcinoembryonic antigen and computed tomography findings are equivocal for recurrent diseases."}

Local recurrence of rectal cancer after curative surgery appears in 5 to 30 percent of all cases. It is necessary to detect local recurrence in a resectable stage to have an opportunity for curative reintervention or palliative prevention of those symptoms. Because most local recurrences occur extraluminally, conventional follow-up fails to detect them at an early stage. Therefore, a prospective study was performed to assess the diagnostic potential of endorectal and endovaginal ultrasound to detect asymptomatic resectable local recurrence. In 338 patients 721 endoluminal ultrasound examinations were added to routine follow-up of rectal and left colonic cancer, with a mean of 2.1 (range, 1-10) endoluminal ultrasound examinations for each patient. A total of 116 patients (34.3 percent) were shown to have local recurrence, which was suggested by endoluminal ultrasound and proven by endoluminal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy in all cases of unclear pararectal structures that could not be verified by endoscopic biopsy. Digital examination failed to detect local recurrence in 91 patients, endoscopy failed to detect local recurrence in 80 patients, and the levels of tumor markers were normal in 25 patients with confirmed local recurrence. In 33 cases of local recurrence, both digital examination and endoscopy results were normal. Twenty-five patients, in whom carcinoembryonic antigen levels, digital examination, and endoscopy results were normal, underwent potential curative reoperation, with total resection of the local recurrence. All 25 patients were still alive at the end of the study period, and 21 were free from disease. On the other hand, only 6 of 67 patients with local recurrence detectable by conventional follow-up could be operated on with curative intention. Postoperative endoluminal ultrasound is able to detect local recurrence at an earlier and asymptomatic stage and can be verified by endosonography-guided needle biopsy. Routine use in follow-up may raise the ratio of curative retreatment by early detection of extramural local recurrence."}

Some reports have shown that the prognosis for patients with synchronous liver metastases is worse than that for those with metachronous liver metastases. Therefore, determination of the factors that influence outcome after resection of synchronous liver metastases is more important than with metachronous liver metastasis. We studied patients who had been followed for more than 5 years after undergoing resection of synchronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Among the 12 prognostic factors studied (age, gender, adjuvant chemotherapy, tumor site, CEA level, tumor differentiation, tumor size, regional lymph node metastatic status, distribution of liver metastases, number of liver metastases, tumor size and pathological margin), regional lymph node metastatic status and pathological margin were significant prognostic factors by univariate analysis (p = 0.0002 and 0.005, respectively). Regional lymph node metastatic status was a significant prognostic factor by multivariate analysis (p = 0.031). The survival curve of patients with six or more regional lymph node metastases was similar to that of patients with non-resectable liver metastasis. The resection of synchronous liver metastases in patients with six or more regional lymph node metastases is relatively contraindicated. For these patients, other treatment modalities should be considered."}

Upper limit (mean +/- 2SD) of the normal range for CEA in bile was established from samples at surgery for nonneoplastic gallbladder disease. In 11 patients with synchronous liver metastases, biliary CEA levels correlated with the size of hepatic lesions. In 49 patients without evident liver metastases at the time of surgery, elevated biliary CEA levels predicted subsequent emergence of metachronous liver metastases with 75% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and 84% accuracy; serum CEA levels were not a reliable predictor.

Preoperative CEA and CA 19-9 levels have been used in the past as prognostic indicators in colorectal cancer, but Dukes' stage is still considered to be the most important prognostic factor. Recent survival estimates may have been influenced by the fact that in the last decade adjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative irradiation have been included in the routine management of advanced-stage disease. In a heterogeneous Kuwaiti population higher reference levels (95th percentile) of CEA and CA 19-9 have been found than those usually employed. In the present study 62 patients with Dukes' stage B + C could be analyzed for two-year disease-free survival (DFS). Relapse was observed in 19 patients, 28 patients were disease free and 15 patients with censored observations were included. No significant difference in DFS was observed in Dukes' B (69%) versus Dukes' C (48%) patients (p = 0.09). On the other hand, Dukes' stage B + C patients with elevated preoperative levels of CEA or CA 19-9 had a significantly poorer DFS than patients with normal levels. For CEA levels below or above the cutoff the DFS was 74% versus 23% (p = 0.003); for CA 19-9 levels below or above the cutoff the DFS was 71% versus 33% (p = 0.004). In 54 patients with Dukes' stage B + C for whom preoperative levels of both CEA and CA 19-9 were available multivariate analysis revealed a decreasing risk of relapse in the following order: CEA and/or CA 19-9 elevated (chi-square 7.09; p = 0.008), CA 19-9 elevated (chi-square 6.27; p = 0.01), CEA elevated (chi-square 5.47; p = 0.02), and Dukes' C (chi-square 2.08; p = 0.15 n.s.). Hence, novel treatment protocols may have improved the disease-free survival, but the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is of questionable benefit in patients who have elevated levels of CEA and/or CA 19-9 prior to treatment."}

To evaluate retrospectively the long-term results of an approach consisting of performing surgery in every patient in whom radical removal of all metastatic disease was technically feasible. The indications for surgical resection for liver metastases from colorectal cancer remain controversial. Several clinical risk factors have been reported to influence survival. Between March 1980 and December 1997, 235 patients underwent hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. Survival rates and disease-free survival as a function of clinical and pathologic determinants were examined retrospectively with univariate and multivariate analyses. The overall 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 51%, 38%, 26%, and 24%, respectively. The stage of the primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, and multiple nodules were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Disease-free survival was significantly influenced by lymph node metastasis, a short interval between treatment of the primary and metastatic tumors, and a high preoperative level of carcinoembryonic antigen. The 10-year survival rate of patients with four or more nodules (29%) was better than that of patients with two or three nodules (16%), and similar to that of patients with a solitary lesion (32%). Surgical resection is useful for treating liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Although multiple metastases significantly impaired the prognosis, the life expectancy of patients with four or more nodules mandates removal."}

The number of lesions considered highly suspicious for metastatic lesions were determined for each sequence and were compared to the results of surgery. The McNemar test was used to compare the outcomes of the different sequences. MR Imaging was unable to detect small (<5 mm) metastases discovered at surgery. The best non-contrast sequences for detecting metastases were the STIR with 42% sensitivity, 83% specificity and an overall accuracy of 56% and the T1W sequence (sensitivity 38%, specificity 100%, accuracy 57%), which were not significantly different (p 0.4).

For conventional RIT, mice were treated with 96 MBq 131-labeled anti-CEA F(ab')2. Control groups were left untreated. Toxicity and tumor growth were monitored at weekly intervals. Doses used for conventional RIT induced severe toxicity and resulted in death of several treated animals. Nevertheless, all surviving animals treated with 131I-labeled anti-CEA F(ab')2 relapsed shortly after treatment (tumor growth delay = 48+/-13 d). For animals treated with the AES reagents, toxicity varied with the pretargeting time interval and the administered activity. For 20-h pretargeting time, the maximum tolerated dose was 96 MBq. For all AES RIT except 1 (with 48-h pretargeting time interval and growth delay of 82+/-26 d), no tumor growth was observed over a period of 8 mo. Furthermore, based on clinical and histologic criteria, 33% of the treated mice were considered cured. High cure rates of LS174T colon carcinoma were achieved with the AES, and the flexibility of the pretargeting approach allowed the control of hematologic toxicity, which is the main limitation to dose escalation with conventional RIT."}

To assess the outcome of a multi-institutional, national cooperative group study attempting functional preservation of the anorectum for patients with limited, distal rectal cancer. Between September 21, 1989 and November 1, 1992, a Phase II trial of sphincter-sparing therapy was conducted for patients with clinically mobile rectal cancers located below the pelvic peritoneal reflection. Protocol treatment was designed for patients who were, in the judgement of their attending surgeon, unsuitable for anal sphincter conservation in the context of anterior resection, and would have required abdominoperineal resection (APR) as conventional surgical therapy. Primary cancers were estimated to be 4 cm or less in largest clinical diameter, and occupied 40% or less of the rectal circumference. Chest radiography and computerized axial tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis excluded patients with overt lymphatic or hematogenous metastases. Protocol surgery was intended to remove the primary cancer by en-bloc, transmural excision of an ellipse of rectal wall by transanal, transcoccygeal, or trans-sacral technique, while conserving the anal sphincter. Based on tumor size, T classification, grade, and adequacy of surgical margins, patients were allocated to one of three treatment assignments: observation, or adjuvant treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and one of two different dose levels of local-regional radiation. After completion of protocol therapy, patients were observed with follow-up that included periodic general physical and rectal examination, determinations of CEA, abdominopelvic CT, chest radiography, and surveillance endoscopy. Sixty-five eligible and analyzable patients were registered. With minimum follow-up of 5 years and median follow-up of 6.1 years, 11 patients have failed: 3 patients recurred local-regionally only, 3 patients had distant failure alone, and 5 patients manifested local-regional and distant failure. Eight patients died of intercurrent illness. Local-regional failure correlated with T-category revealed: T1 1/27 (4%), T2 4/25 (16%), and T3 3/13 (23%).

Five of 8 patients with local-regional recurrence achieved local-regional control with management including surgery, although 4 of these patients subsequently developed distant dissemination. Three patients (5%) had persistent, uncontrolled, local disease. Actuarial freedom from pelvic relapse at 5 years is 88% based on the entire study population, and 86% for the less favorable patients treated with adjuvant radiation and 5-FU. Conservative, sphincter-sparing therapy is a feasible alternative treatment for selected patients with limited cancer involving the middle and lower rectum. Risk of both local and distant failure appears to escalate with increasing T-category (depth of invasion).

In 1994, a novel sensitive method termed immuno-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of the gastric carcinoma-associated antigen MG7-Ag in the gastric carcinoma cell line KATO III was reported. Compared with the enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay, the single determinant immuno-PCR technique could allow for as few as 20 cells to be detected and was found to show an approximately 10,000-fold enhancement in sensitivity of the detection limit. The current study clinically evaluated the significance of serum MG7-Ag detection in gastric carcinoma patients. The sera of patients were immobilized on wells and a specific DNA molecule, which could be amplified by PCR, was employed as a marker. The biotinylated monoclonal antibody against gastric carcinoma was added to bind the antigen immobilized on the wells. After the biotinylated antibody was bound to the antigen, free avidin was used to attach a biotinylated monoclonal antibody and biotinylated DNA molecule. The biotinylated DNA complexed with antigen-antibody-avidin was amplified by PCR and the PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In the current study this method was used to detect circulating MG7-Ag in the sera of patients with gastric carcinoma and other various malignancies. For comparison, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 50, CA 19-9, and TAG-72 were quantitated by radioimmunoassay and immunoradiometric assay using the relevant commercial kits in the same sera samples from 86 patients with pathologically confirmed gastric carcinoma and 83 patients with relevant benign diseases of the stomach. In addition, the semiquantitative analysis of PCR products among gastric carcinoma patients with or without metastasis was performed to compare the intensity of DNA band amplification. Using the immuno-PCR assay, positive results were obtained in 164 of 198 patients with gastric carcinoma (82.8%). The rates of positivity in other malignancies were 17.4% for esophageal carcinoma (15 of 86 patients), 44.4% for colonic carcinoma (40 of 90 patients), 0% for liver carcinoma (none of 84 patients), 2.2% for ovarian carcinoma (1 of 45 patients), 0% for uterine carcinoma (none of 27 patients), and 6.1% for lung carcinoma (4 of 66 patients). The positive results obtained from those patients with benign diseases were: 7.7% for peptic ulcer (6 of 78 patients), 5.9% for chronic gastritis (7 of 118 patients), 3.3% for chronic colitis (2 of 60 patients), and 0.8% for healthy blood donors (2 of 236 patients). In addition, the semiquantitative analysis of PCR products showed that the intensity of DNA band amplified from the PCR products of those patients with metastasis was much higher than that of patients without metastasis or those with early stage tumors (1.94 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.02). In comparative studies of immuno-PCR and commercial assays for tumor-associated antigens the sensitivity of immuno-PCR was 81.4% and pseudopositivity was lower (8.4% vs. 7.2-12.0% with radioimmunoassay or immunoradiometric assay). The results of the current study demonstrate that introducing PCR into the indirect determination of tumor-associated antigen in the serum can improve the sensitivity of detection greatly. This novel assay also might be used to monitor the circulating amount of tumor-associated antigen after gastrectomy and provide information regarding recurrence or metastasis, as well as for screening elderly patients who have no indications for endoscopy and those with precancerous conditions. The application of immuno-PCR in the serologic diagnosis of carcinoma has significant advantages including ready application in the clinical setting as well as use as a potential screening tool in mass surveys of high risk populations with gastric carcinoma.

To analyze the survival predictors of patients undergoing hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastasis to determine useful indicators for therapy selection. Although recurrence develops in more than two thirds of patients undergoing hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastasis, preoperative characteristics that might predict such recurrence have yet to be clearly identified. Clinicopathologic data of 85 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer who underwent a curative resection of primary lesions and metastatic liver diseases at one institute were analyzed using the multivariate method with respect to both the metastatic state and the primary lesion. Multivariate analysis indicated that the aggressiveness of the primary tumor, early liver metastasis, and a large number of liver metastases were the characteristics that could be detected before hepatectomy and that independently indicated a worse survival. A three-ranked classification based on these coefficients (H-staging) was significantly related to both the recurrence rate within 6 months (7% in H-stage A, 30% in B, and 44% in C) and the 5-year survival rates (55%, 14%, and 0% respectively). An additional scoring system (H'-staging) based on the aggressiveness of the primary tumor and the level of carcinoembryonic antigen 1 to 3 months after hepatectomy was found to be related to the mode of subsequent recurrence and surgical resectability of the recurrent foci. H-staging can provide useful prognostic information for the treatment of liver metastasis. H-staging could also help in predicting the possible mode of recurrence after hepatectomy and in determining the most suitable mode of additional therapy. Further multiinstitutional studies based on a large collective database will confirm the utility of these two staging systems."}

This study examined the prognostic information regarding the risk of postoperative tumor recurrence obtained by simultaneous determination of preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and immunohistochemical expression of p53 protein in tumor tissue from patients with colorectal carcinoma. A retrospective study of 174 patients (AJCC/UICC Stages I, II and III) was conducted. Serum CEA levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. Immunohistochemical expression of nuclear p53 protein was assessed in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded archival tumor tissue. The results of both factors were categorized by clinical and histopathologic variables. The relative prognostic significance of all factors with regard to disease free survival was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The stability of the predictive value of both markers was assessed: 1) by splitting the follow-up into three intervals and performing separate analyses for each period and 2) graphically by plotting the corresponding cumulative hazards ratio along the follow-up. Eighty-two (47%) tumors manifested overexpression of p53 protein and 60 tumors (34.4%) exhibited elevated serum CEA levels (cutoff value of 5 ng/mL). p53 positive immunostaining and elevated CEA levels were associated with low cumulative disease free survival at 60 months' of follow-up, and proved to have independent prognostic significance. Analysis performed in different time periods of follow-up showed that the prognostic effect of both markers was not stable over time. The predictive significance of CEA and p53 changed along the study periods. An elevated preoperative CEA level was an indicator of a high risk of recurrence only during the first 2 years after surgery (hazards ratio, 3.26; 95% confidence interval 95% CI, 1.65-6.42). The presence of p53 immunoreactivity in the primary tumor was an indicator of a high risk of recurrence only after the first year of follow-up (hazards ratio, 4.02; 95% CI, 1.68-9.6). The serum CEA level and expression of p53 protein provide complementary prognostic information. Time-dependency of the prognostic influence of both parameters should be taken into consideration when establishing postoperative predictive estimations."}

Imaging of cancer by radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) following administration of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or fragments has been under development for two decades. Efficacy is a function of many variables: antigen expression on tumor cells relative to normal tissues and body fluids, affinity, specificity, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of the mAb and properties of the radionuclide and imaging techniques. CEA-Scan (a 99mTclabeled Fab' fragment of a mouse mAb directed against CEA) has several advantageous properties, and has been approved for use in colorectal cancer SPECT imaging in North America and Europe, and is also under investigation in Japan. It has been shown to complement CT in detecting recurrent or metastatic disease, even in the liver where 111In mAbs frequently fail. In breast cancer, it provides clearer identification of malignant disease in patients with indiscriminate mammography. Recently, it has also been used intra-operatively in radio-immunoguided surgery in both colorectal and breast cancer patients. These new applications are currently under active investigation and clinical trials are planned. Clinically useful information is obtained in a relatively high percentage of patients, which can alter treatment decisions. In most cases the benefits are in reducing unnecessary surgery or biopsies in inoperable patients, but major benefits (especially in colorectal cancer) would be obtained if new therapies effective against the RIS-detected minimal residual disease were forthcoming."}

A total of 35 gastric, 24 colorectal, 4 esophageal and 4 biliary tract cancer patients and nine normal healthy subjects were studied. No CEA mRNA was detected in the nine normal healthy volunteers. CEA mRNA was detected in 100% (10/10) of metastatic, 33.3% (3/9) of early gastric cancer (EGC), and 18.8% (3/16) resectable gastric cancer patients, respectively. In colorectal cancer, 55.6% (5/9) of metastatic cancers were positive for CEA mRNA, and 26.7% (4/15) Duke stage B/C showed positive. One patient with stage III gastric cancer who was negative CEA mRNA initially and turned positive during follow-up, developed multiple bone metastasis one month later. Another stage III patient, who was positive for CEA mRNA, preoperatively revealed early relapse in two months. These results suggest that the identification of circulating tumor cells using RT-PCR for the detection of CEA mRNA is feasible and this analysis may be a promising tool for early detection of micrometastatic circulating malignant cells in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer."}

Thirty-nine of 86 patients (45.3%) were positive for serum p53 antibodies. However, there was no relation with the cancer progression or clinicopathological findings. The sensitivities of CEA, CA19-9 and AFP were 36.0%, 38.4%, and 8.1% respectively, but there was no relation between serum p53 antibodies and these three markers. When the sensitivity of serum p53 antibodies and CEA was evaluated according to clinical stage, the presence of serum p53 antibodies was more significantly associated with stage 0, I and II colorectal cancer than was CEA. Thirty-three patients who showed preoperative positivity for serum p53 antibodies were followed by serial evaluation of circulating antibodies after resection. Negative conversions after resection were significantly higher in the \"Cur A\" group than in the \"Cur B\" or \"Cur C\" groups. Serum p53 antibodies appear to be a useful tumor marker independent of the other markers, especially in the early stage, and are expected to be useful in the development of a method of early diagnosis for mass screening, and as a postoperative monitoring marker for colorectal cancer."}

The usefulness of determining blood levels of the soluble p53 antigen and CEA was evaluated with respect to the monitoring colon cancer patients. HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) was used to measure serum levels of the soluble 53 kDa protein (s53) after its partial isolation on gel fiberglass affinity chromatography columns. The blood of cancer patients before tumor removal contained a high amount of s53 protein which did not change significantly over several subsequent months (4.5 and 4.7 mg/ml, respectively). The average serum level of CEA was relatively low but with extremely high deviations (48 +/- 128 ng/ml). In patients with recurrent cancer and metastases, the serum concentrations of the s53 protein and CEA remained at high levels and their changes during the period studied were not significant (3.9 +/- 3.5 and 6.1 +/- 2.9 for s53; 56.5 +/- 148.5 and 209.9 +/- 867.3 for CEA). Disease progression was accompanied by slight increase in the serum levels of the s53 protein (3.5 +/- 2.2 and 7.6 +/- 4.6) or CEA (143.3 +/- 98.5 and 244.9 +/- 873.8). Despite the absence of statistically significant changes in the serum levels of the s53 protein in different groups of patients, on an individual basis such changes could be detected and could be of diagnostic value. Findings suggest that HPLC determinations of blood levels of the s53 protein can be a useful means of monitoring cancer patients only if tumor removal is complete and the patient exhibits a subsequent sharp decrease in the p53 protein serum level. In such cases, a following increase in the serum level of the p53 protein reflects the initiation of a new neoplastic formation which can then be detected a few months earlier than by any other available method. However, if the patient's immune system reacts weakly to the operation and the blood concentration of the s53 protein remains high, neither CEA nor s53 levels can be used for monitoring purposes."}

Although clinical staging of neoplastic diseases has long remained the only approach to prognosis and treatment, parameters for stage determination, such as tumor size (T) and lymph-node involvement (N), do not always provide effective indication of optimal treatment. Molecular medicine has also provided useful indications as to an alternative and/or integration to clinical staging. Despite the numerous possibilities afforded by pre-operative staging techniques, failures in defining the real spread of neoplasias into surrounding structures have remained a very important diagnostic problem. The labeling of monoclonal antibodies binding with neoplastic target cells by way of radioactive isotopes introduced the techniques known as immunoscintigraphy and SPECT, which then evolved into radioimmunoguided surgery. Fourty patients suffering from colorectal cancer whose age ranged between 42-82 years were singled out for this study. Before undergoing surgery, they were administered pancoloscopy and macrobiopsies, AP-LL chest x-rays, hepatobiliary ECT, echoendoscopy, abdomen and pelvis CT with nephrostographic phase, and total body bone scintigraphy. They were treated with 125I-B72.3 and 125I-FO23C5 (5% and 95% of patients, respectively). Thyrosuppression was achieved by Lugol solution (15 drops x 3/die) from the 6th day before infusion and until the day of surgical operation. Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) has also been tested on staging and second-look of ovarian tumors. Five years after surgical operation the survival rate of Dukes A patients (15%) was confirmed to amount to 100%, whereas for Dukes B patients (50%) having undergone RIGS-guided exeresis on single unrecognized metastases (2 patients) and on unrecognized n+ (5 patients) the survival rate was found to be 85% after 5 years; 2 patients deceased due to relapse; 1 patient deceased due to e.p.a. Finally, for Dukes C patients; (35%) having undergone RIGS-guided exeresis on unrecognized liver micrometastases (1 patient), on single isolated metastases (2 patients) and in the occurrence of multicentric lymph-node positivity (9 patients), the survival rate after 5 years was found to amount to 64%; 5 patients deceased due to relapse. Out of 19 patients without pre-operative evidence of ovarian tumor as opposed to just 1 patient suspected of pelvic recurrence, after intra-operative surgical radicalization (45%), 1 patient was diagnosed fibrosis (suspicious lesion on CT) and 1 other patient peritoneal MTS (negative CT) by means of RIGS. RIGS has made it possible: to localize primary and/or metastatic lesions; to determine tumor-free margins, loco-regional disease spread; to differentiate suspicious foci on inspection and palpation (biotopic sampling); to detect invisible and impalpable tumor foci (occult sites); to verify radical exeresis; to evaluate lymphatic drainage stations; to enable guided exeresis of liver metastases."}

Between May 1986 and December 1997, 38 patients had an excision for pulmonary metastases for CCR. The mean delay between diagnosis of the metastases and surgical treatment of the CCR was 39 +/- 24 months (0-98). Thirty two patients (84%) had a single pulmonary metastasis.

Fourteen patients had an abnormally elevated level of carcinoembrionic antigen (ACE-CEA) before the pulmonary excision. Five pneumonectomies, 23 lobectomies, 1 bilobectomy and 11 atypical resections were carried out. A lymph node clearance was performed in 25 cases. Six patients (16%) had an associated excision of an hepatic metastasis. The in-hospital mortality was 2.6%. Chemotherapy was associated with a pulmonary excision in 17 patients (46%).

Age, sex, histological stage of the primary tumor, the size and the delay in appearance in the pulmonary metastases, the number of metastases, the preoperative CEA, the operative technique and the perioperative chemotherapy did not influence the levels of survival at five years. At the same time associated excision of an hepatic metastasis did not worsen the prognosis at five years. Complete excision of pulmonary metastases in a colorectal cancer allows for significantly longer survival.

A retrospective review was undertaken of 145 patients undergoing curative surgery for rectal adenocarcinoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer stages II and III) and treated with postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy from January 1994 to February 1997. Patients with known metastatic disease, with gross residual disease after surgery, or without an available postoperative CEA level before adjuvant therapy were not included. All patients were monitored for a minimum of 1 year or until death. The rates of relapse, disease-free survival and overall survival were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analyses for the endpoint time to relapse was carried out for the following potential prognostic factors: age, gender, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, number of lymph nodes, perineural invasion, capillary-like space invasion, margin status, and postoperative CEA level (< or = 4.0 microg/L vs > 4.0 microg/L). A mulitvariate regression analyses was conducted with the Cox proportional hazards model. With a median follow-up of 45 months, the disease-free and overall survival rates at 2 years were 78% and 90% respectively. Eight patients were identified who expressed an elevated postoperative CEA (4.1-10.2 microg/L). Two patients had T3N0 tumors; one tumor was T4N0, four tumors were T3N1, and one was T4N1. The median time to first relapse in these eight patients was 26 months, compared with 69 months for the 137 patients with a postoperative CEA in the normal range (0-4.0 microg/L), (log-rank Chi-squared test = 4.92). As determined by a proportional hazards model, an elevated CEA remained an independent predictor (along with number of positive nodes) for early relapse. Postoperative CEA in patients undergoing curative surgery for rectal cancer provides additional prognostic information in those patients embarking on adjuvant postoperative therapy. An elevated CEA predicts for early relapse and may help define a high-risk subset of patients in whom more aggressive adjuvant therapies should be considered."}

We wanted in our departments to investigate whether a dual-head gamma camera with coincidence detection could serve as a substitute for the dedicated PET scanner. Twenty consecutive PET scans of 18F-FDG were performed by means of an Adac VertexPLUS gamma camera in 14 patients with colorectal cancer and four patients with anal cancer with known or suspected recurrences. Evaluation of the patients were, however, according to the routine in the department. In fourteen patients one or more abnormal foci were detected by PET, nine of these were verified by biopsy and one by renewed CT scan. In the four patients with negative PET the findings were in agreement with later biopsies. In one patient PET was \"falsely\" negative with regards to other processes than a solitary metastasis to be removed, as he six months later revealed dissemination confirmed by biopsy.

The analysis was performed in exons 5-9 by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by direct sequencing. Forty-five percent of tumors showed mutation in p53, and this was observed only in exons 5-8. Mutations at codon positions 167, 196, 204, 213, 245, 281, 282, 286, and 306; deletion of codon 251 and of the first nucleotide of codon 252; and Leu residue (CTC) insertion downstream codon 252 are reported for the first time in colorectal liver metastasis. Mutations at codon positions 163, 248, and 273 have been reported previously. Correlation of p53 status with clinical parameters showed that patients with mutated p53 had a statistically higher number of lesions when compared with patients with wild-type p53 (P<0.050). In particular, of patients with mutated p53, 41% had three or more metastases compared with 14% of patients with wild-type p53. Synchronous metastases were present in 70% of the patients with p53 mutations and in only 29% of patients with wild-type p53 (P<0.025). In addition, patients with p53 mutations are more likely to develop recurrence (73%) compared with patients with wild-type p53 (33%; P<0.001). Other factors considered, including preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, bilobar distribution, and size of the lesion(s), did not show significant correlation with p53 status.

We have been investigating the use of cross-linked divalent (DFM) and trivalent (TFM) versions of the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody A5B7 as possible alternatives to the parent forms (IgG and F(ab')2) which have been used previously in clinical radioimmunotherapy (RIT) studies in colorectal carcinoma. Comparative biodistribution studies of similar sized DFM and F(ab')2 and TFM and IgG, radiolabelled with both 131I and 90Y have been described previously using the human colorectal tumour LS174T nude mouse xenograft model (Casey et al (1996) Br J Cancer 74: 1397-1405). In this study quantitative estimates of radiation distribution and RIT in the xenograft model provided more insight into selecting the most suitable combination for future RIT. Radiation doses were significantly higher in all tissues when antibodies were labelled with 90Y. Major contributing organs were the kidneys, liver and spleen. The extremely high absorbed dose to the kidneys on injection of 90Y-labelled DFM and F(ab')2 as a result of accumulation of the radiometal would result in extremely high toxicity. These combinations are clearly unsuitable for RIT. Cumulative dose of 90Y-TFM to the kidney was 3 times lower than the divalent forms but still twice as high as for 90Y-IgG. TFM clears faster from the blood than IgG, producing higher tumour to blood ratios. Therefore when considering only the tumour to blood ratios of the total absorbed dose, the data suggests that TFM would be the most suitable candidate. However, when corrected for equitoxic blood levels, doses to normal tissues for TFM were approximately twice the level of IgG, producing a two-fold increase in the overall tumour to normal tissue ratio. In addition RIT revealed that for a similar level of toxicity and half the administered activity, 90Y-IgG produced a greater therapeutic response. This suggests that the most promising A5B7 antibody form with the radionuclide 90Y may be IgG. Dosimetry analysis revealed that the tumour to normal tissue ratios were greater for all 131I-labelled antibodies. This suggests that 131I may be a more suitable radionuclide for RIT, in terms of lower toxicity to normal tissues. The highest tumour to blood dose and tumour to normal tissue ratio at equitoxic blood levels was 131I-labelled DFM, suggesting that 131I-DFM may be best combination of antibody and radionuclide for A5B7. The dosimetry estimates were in agreement with RIT results in that twice the activity of 131I-DFM must be administered to produce a similar therapeutic effect as 131I-TFM. The toxicity in this therapy experiment was minimal and further experiments at higher doses are required to observe if there would be any advantage of a higher initial dose rate for 131I-DFM."}

Twenty-eight patients (60 percent) required partial or complete bladder resection with or without adjacent viscera, and all had internal iliac and obturator node dissection. There were four postoperative (within 60 days) deaths, 8 percent in curative groups (5.4 percent overall). Major complications included prolonged intubation (20 percent), sepsis (34 percent), posterior wound infection or flap separation (38 percent). The survival rate in the curative group (49 postoperative survivors) was 31 percent at five years, with 13 patients surviving beyond five years. Seven of these patients survived from 5 to 21 years, whereas six patients recurred again and died within 5.5 to 7.5 years after abdominosacral resection. Disease-free survival rate at five years was 23 percent. Recent reconstruction with large composite myocutaneous gluteal flaps in 5 patients permitted complete sacral wound coverage, resulting in earlier ambulation and reduced hospital stay. Abdominosacral resection permits removal of pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer that is fixed to the sacrum and is associated with long-term survival in 31 percent of patients. Recent technical advances have improved the short-term outcome and have made the procedure more feasible for surgical teams familiar with these techniques."}

We generated an anti-idiotype antibody, designated CeaVac, that is an internal image of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). We previously demonstrated that the majority of patients with advanced colorectal cancer generate specific anti-CEA responses. The purpose of the current study was to treat patients with surgically resected colon cancer with CeaVac to determine the immune response and clinical outcome to treatment with vaccine. We also compared the immune responses between patients treated with fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy regimens plus vaccine versus vaccine alone. Thirty-two patients with resected Dukes' B, C, and D, and incompletely resected Dukes' D disease were treated with 2 mg of CeaVac every other week for four injections and then monthly until tumor recurrence or progression. Fourteen patients were treated concurrently with 5-FU chemotherapy regimens. All 32 patients entered onto this trial generated high-titer immunoglobulin G and T-cell proliferative immune responses against CEA. The 5-FU regimens did not have a qualitative or quantitative effect on the immune response. Three of 15 patients with Dukes' B and C disease progressed at 19, 24, and 35 months. Seven of eight patients with completely resected Dukes' D disease remained on study from 12 to 33 months; one patient with resected Dukes' D disease relapsed at 9 months. One patient with incompletely resected Dukes' D disease remained on study at 14 months without evidence of progression; eight experienced disease progression at 6 to 31 months. CeaVac consistently generated a potent anti-CEA humoral and cellular immune response in all 32 patients entered onto this trial. A number of very high-risk patients continue on study. 5-FU regimens, which are the standard of care for patients with Dukes' C disease, did not affect the immune response. These data warrant a phase III trial for patients with resected colon cancer."}

Isolated organ perfusion with hyperthermia and melphalan with or without tumor necrosis factor-alpha has been effectively used to treat regionally confined, unresectable malignancies of both the limb and liver. Many patients, however, will eventually relapse at distant sites. We used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine whether significant tumor microembolization occurs in patients undergoing isolated limb perfusion (ILP), isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP), or hepatic resection. Primers specific for the human tyrosinase gene or carcinoembryonic antigen gene were designed for RT-PCR to screen melanoma or colon adenocarcinoma, respectively. RNA from human melanoma lines (Pmel and 1286) and human colon adenocarcinoma lines (H508 and HT29) were used to generate positive control cDNA. Normal human blood was inoculated with tumor cells at concentrations that ranged from 10(-2) to 10(5) tumor cells/ml of blood to define the sensitivity. Systemic and perfusate blood samples were drawn from 15 patients (8 patients underwent IHP, 5 patients underwent ILP, and 2 patients underwent resection) before the start of the operation, immediately before and during the perfusion, and postoperatively. Mononuclear cell fractions were separated from the blood samples and RNA was extracted for the RT-PCR assay. Standard primers for human beta-actin were used to confirm that cDNA was generated after the RT reaction. RT-PCR assay sensitivity was determined to be 10 tumor cells/ml of whole blood. Of the 8 IHP patients, 6 had colon metastases and 2 had ocular melanoma metastases to the liver. All 5 ILP patients had in transit melanoma of the extremity. Two patients with colon metastases to the liver were found to have resectable disease. There were no detectable circulating tumor cells in the systemic circulation either preoperatively or postoperatively in all 15 patients that were screened. RT-PCR is a highly sensitive method of detecting tumor cells in perfusate or blood. Manipulation of the limb or liver followed by resection or isolated hyperthermic perfusion does not cause detectable release of circulating tumor cells. The late development of distant metastases observed in many of these patients does not correlate with the ability to measure circulating tumor cells during regional therapy."}

The primary lesion was diagnosed as rectal cancer (Rb), and it was histologically found to be well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The preoperative enhanced CT demonstrated 8 metastatic lesions in bilateral lobes of the liver. Low anterior resection for rectum and open microwave coagulation therapy (MCT) for liver metastasis were synchronously performed. The coagulated areas after MCT revealed no enhancement. The serum CEA levels returned to normal for 9 months. Nine months after the first operation, we detected 6 recurrent lesions in the other sites of the remnant liver. We used second open MCT because the hepatic arterial chemotherapy was ineffective. We performed percutaneous MCT for the next new lesions.

Fifty-seven patients with T3/T4 rectal cancer were divided into the two groups according to the serum CEA status. Angiogenesis was defined as the intratumoral vessel count by immunohistochemical staining using CD31. The CD31 count was significantly higher in the recurrent patients in both groups and the ratio of nodal involvement was significantly higher in the recurrent patients of the CEA-negative group. Local recurrence mainly developed in the CEA-negative group; however, the CD31 count did not predict the sites of recurrence nor the relapse period in the both groups. A multivariate analysis showed a high CD31 count >26) to be a prognostic factor not only for recurrence but also for survival (P = 0.001, 0.043, respectively). These results suggest that a high degree of tumor angiogenesis in sections of T3/T4 rectal cancer may therefore be an important predictor for CEA-negative recurrence."}

At the time of surgery, occult metastases (micrometastases) are present in more than 50% of colorectal cancer patients, and the liver is the most frequent site of apparent metastatic disease. Frequently, adjuvant chemotherapy is unable to prevent tumor recurrence. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are warranted. The aim of this study was to establish a model of human colon cancer metastatic to the liver of nude mice, to assess, in this setting, the therapeutic efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) compared to standard chemotherapy and to evaluate, in a Phase I/II trial, the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of RAIT in colorectal cancer patients with small volume disease metastatic to the liver. Multiple liver metastases of the human colon cancer cell line GW-39 were induced by intrasplenic injection of a 10% tumor cell suspension. Whereas controls were left untreated, therapy was initiated on day 10 or 20 after tumor inoculation with the 131I-labeled, low affinity anticarcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) monoclonal antibody (MAb), F023C5 (Ka = 10(7) liters/mol), or the high-affinity anti-CEA MAb, MN-14 (Ka = 10(9) liters/mol), or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (folinic acid) versus irinotecan) at their respective maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). Twelve colorectal cancer patients with small volume disease metastatic to the liver (all lesions < or = 2.5 cm) were entered into a mCi/m2-based Phase I dose escalation study with 131I-labeled humanized version of MN-14, hMN-14. The patients were given single injections, starting at 50 mCi/m2 and escalating in 10-mCi/m2 increments. The MTD was defined as the dose level at which < or = 1 of 6 patients develop grade 4 myelotoxicity. In the mice, untreated controls died from rapidly progressing hepatic metastases at 6-8 weeks after tumor inoculation. The life span of mice treated with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin was prolonged for only 1-3 weeks, whereas irinotecan led to a 5-8-week prolongation. In contrast, at their respective MTDs, the 131I-labeled low-affinity anti-CEA MAb, F023C5, led to a 20% permanent cure rate, and the high affinity MAb, MN-14, led to an 80% permanent cure rate, when therapy was initiated at 10 days after tumor inoculation. In the 20-day-old tumor stage, although it prolonged life, 131I-F023C5 was unable to achieve cures, whereas 131I-MN-14 was still successful in 20%. Histologically, no remaining viable tumor cells could be demonstrated in these animals surviving > 6 months. In patients, the MTD was reached at 60 mCi/m2 of hMN-14 (at 70 mCi/m2, two of three grade 4 myelotoxicities). Of 11 assessable patients, 2 had partial remissions (corresponding to an objective response rate of 18%), and 5 (45%) had minor/mixed responses or experienced stabilization of previously rapidly progressing disease. These data suggest that in small volume disease, RAIT may be superior to conventional chemotherapy. Antibodies of higher affinity seem to be clearly superior. The clinical response rates in patients with small volume disease are encouraging, being comparable to the response rates of conventional chemotherapeutic regimens but with fewer side effects. Ongoing studies will show whether treatment at the MTD will further improve therapeutic results."}

A whole-body scan followed by SPET imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed 4-6 and 20-24 h after the intravenous infusion of 0.6-1.0 mg of intact anti-CEA monoclonal BW 431/26 antibody labelled with 814-1110 MBq of 99Tcm. The HAMA response and serum CEA levels were determined. Immunoscintigraphic findings were verified by biopsy, radiologically and/or by 2 year follow-up. On an individual patient basis, immunoscintigraphy demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 100%, accuracy of 87%, positive predictive value of 100% and negative predictive value of 60%. Better results were achieved in the pelvic region than in the liver or in the extra-hepatic abdominal region. We evaluated 40 lesions; on an individual lesion basis, immuno-scintigraphy gave a sensitivity of 80% and an accuracy of 80%. SPET images detected significantly more lesions than whole-body planar images (P < 0.05). SPET at 20-24 h detected significantly more 'hot' lesions than at 4-6 h (P < 0.01). No correlation between CEA serum levels and immunoscintigraphy was observed (r = 0.376, P > 0.05). One of nine patients (11%) developed HAMA after immunoscintigraphy. We conclude that immunoscintigraphy with BW 431/26 antibody appears able to differentiate between tumour recurrence and scar tissue, and to evaluate liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. Serum CEA levels appear not to influence the result of immunoscintigraphy and the HAMA response is minimal. A delayed SPET scan should be part of an immunoscintigraphic imaging protocol when 99Tcm-labelled BW 431/26 monoclonal antibody is used."}

The appropriate use of plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the management of patients with colorectal cancer has been debated over the last 30 years. It is clear from the very low sensitivity of this test in normal populations that there is no role for CEA assessment as a screening tool for colon cancer. Although in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer, elevations of CEA generally indicate disease progression, while decreases are indicative of improvement, there is no convincing evidence that CEA monitoring significantly affects either survival or quality of life. The area of most interest for CEA monitoring has been the potential for its use after curative resection. The purpose of postoperative CEA monitoring would be to detect recurrence of cancer at an early, surgically curable stage. There is good evidence that routine CEA monitoring postresection of colon cancer detects metastatic disease on average 5 months before routine follow-up evaluation without CEA monitoring detects recurrence. Also, studies demonstrate that some patients with recurrent cancer detected by CEA monitoring may be cured by surgical resection of metastases. However, the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach is not clear, and convincing definition of the role of postoperative CEA monitoring awaits the results of large randomized clinical trials."}

Clinical, pathologic, and outcome data for 1001 consecutive patients undergoing liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer between July 1985 and October 1998 were examined. These resections included 237 trisegmentectomies, 394 lobectomies, and 370 resections encompassing less than a lobe. The surgical mortality rate was 2.8%. The 5-year survival rate was 37%, and the 10-year survival rate was 22%. Seven factors were found to be significant and independent predictors of poor long-term outcome by multivariate analysis: positive margin (p = 0.004), extrahepatic disease (p = 0.003), node-positive primary (p = 0.02), disease-free interval from primary to metastases <12 months (p = 0.03), number of hepatic tumors >1 (p = 0.0004), largest hepatic tumor >5 cm (p = 0.01), and carcinoembryonic antigen level >200 ng/ml (p = 0.01). When the last five of these criteria were used in a preoperative scoring system, assigning one point for each criterion, the total score was highly predictive of outcome (p < 0.0001). No patient with a score of 5 was a long-term survivor. Resection of hepatic colorectal metastases may produce long-term survival and cure. Long-term outcome can be predicted from five criteria that are readily available for all patients considered for resection. Patients with up to two criteria can have a favorable outcome. Patients with three, four, or five criteria should be considered for experimental adjuvant trials. Studies of preoperative staging techniques or of adjuvant therapies should consider using such a score for stratification of patients."}

Serum p53 antibodies were detected in 30 of 145 patients (21%), mostly in Astler-Coller stage B1 (28% of patients). No association was found between p53 antibody status in stage A+B1+B2 vs stages C1+C2+D (22% vs 19%) i.e. between patients without and with metastases to regional lymph nodes and/or distant metastases. Serum p53 antibodies were detected in 9 of 34 patients (26%) with tumour localised in the right part vs 21 of 109 patients (19%) with tumours in the left part of the colon and in 18 of 96 (19%) of patients with tumours localised in rectosigmoideum vs 12 of 47 (26%) with tumours in the remaining colon. There was no significant correlation between serum anti p53 antibody and CEA statuses. Increased level of serum CEA was seen in 46/145 (32%) patients. Patients with C1+C2+D stage cancers had high serum CEA level more frequently than did patients with A+B1+B2 stage tumours (44% vs 19% respectively, p < 0.001). Of 102 cases with normal CEA level, 19 (19%) were positive for anti p53 antibodies. These results together with the literature data [11, 20] indicate that approximately 27% CEA negative patients may have serum p53 antibodies.

CEA levels were determined in twenty tissue biopsy specimens of colon carcinoma and sixteen normal colonic tissue specimens from India, by immunohistochemistry (IH) and by quantitative enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Serum samples from 62 colon cancer patients and 25 healthy blood donors were analyzed for CEA by EIA. Tissue CEA levels were highest for well differentiated adenocarcinomas (5.2-37 micrograms/g protein) with progressively lower levels seen in moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors, and in normals. The intensity of immunostaining paralleled the levels determined quantitatively. Mean serum CEA levels were 1.5 ng/ml for normals and 4.2, 6.4, 23, and 102 ng/ml for Dukes' A, B, C and D stage tumors, respectively. Preoperative serum CEA levels do not, in themselves, take into account differences in CEA production between individual tumors.

CA 242 shows no advantage in lung cancer as compared to the established markers (CEA, CYFRA 21-1 (EIA Roche Germany) and NSE (EIA Hoffmann LaRoche, Switzerland) and no clearly higher expression in early colorectal cancer.

Preoperative diagnosis based on colonoscopy/barium enema, followed by histology and the imaging methods, in most cases US and/or CT. Patients with postoperative stage Dukes D and after palliative surgery were excluded from the follow-up study (n = 43). The patients were seen every three months (clinical investigation, US, CT, tumor markers, FOBT) within the first two postoperative years and every half a year thereafter. 83 of the 116 patients (16%) developed a recurrent disease and 5 of them could be reoperated with curative intention. In addition to the 19 patients 14 simultaneously admitted patients with recurrence of colorectal cancer (total n = 33) were studied. The results of our study analyzing the sensitivity and specificity of colonoscopy, tumor, markers and the FOBT in the preoperative and postoperative phases as well as in the diagnosis of recurrent disease of colorectal cancer confirms the view that FOBT and tumor markers cannot replace endoscopic and imaging methods. However they support the concept, that diagnosis and follow-up of colorectal cancer should be based on a combination of clinical investigation and imaging methods (US, CT etc. and endoscopic and/or x-ray examination) with supplementation by FOBT and determination of tumor markers, mainly CEA. In the case a patient is asking for prognostic and recurrence information as early and as valid as possible we currently recommend the following procedure for the first two years after surgery: every three months the determination of tumor markers, FOBT as well as ultrasound of the upper abdomen and CT of the lower abdomen and every half year a total colonoscopy. The question of whether this program will also have a therapeutical relevance depends on several factors like the personal experience and concepts of the consulting surgeons and oncologists and also on the tasks and duties which are considered worthy by the patient for his further life if confronted with the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer."}

A review is presented on the role of conventional and molecular tumour markers (TM) in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with biliopancreatic malignancies. For biliopancreatic malignancy, following CEA as more historical and basic TM of gastrointestinal diseases, the mainstay marker is CA 19-9 as monosialo-ganglioside/glycolipid and sialyl derivative of lacto-N-fucopentaose II (sialyl-Lewis(a), hapten of human Lewis(a) bloodgroup determinant). It is detected in serum of healthy individuals at low concentration < 40 U/ml, with lower and often transitional elevation in benign hepatobiliary diseases and with highest levels in excretory ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma (s = 70%-95%, sp = 72%-90%), biliary (s = 55%-79%), hepatocellular and cholangiocellular cancer (s = 22%-51%) besides gastric, colorectal and ovarian cancer and occasionally in lung, breast and uterine cancer. Physiologically elevated concentrations in healthy individuals have to be considered in all sorts of secretions (e.g. sputum, saliva, bronchial/gastric secretions, bile juice) of individuals with Lewis(a)-positive secretor status in contrast with low or lacking serum levels of CA 19-9 in patients with Lewis(a-/b-) status (7%-10% of population). In biliopancreatic malignancies, especially pancreatic cancer, CA 19-9 correlates well with clinical course of disease following surgical, chemo- or radiotherapy by a quick normalisation within 2-4 weeks after complete surgery, a transient decrease with successful palliative therapy and an often anticipated increase (lead time up to 6 months) before clinical detection in case of relapse or progressive disease. From CA 19-9 related TM tests some are detecting in addition to sialyl-Lewis(a) (sialyllacto-N-fucopentaose II) also the non-fucosylated precursor sialyl-Lewis(c) (sialyllacto-N-tetraose: CA 50, CA 242, Span-1) solely detected by the DUPAN-2 test and independent of the Lewis(a) secretor status. Some other markers comprise in addition to sialyl-Lewis(a) partially the non-sialylated Lewis(a) antigen (CA 195, CAM 43, CA 494) or are less related (CAM 17.1). The initial phase of screening and early detection is hoped to be better assessed by using molecular markers detecting gene mutations (p53, K-ras), growth factors (EGF, TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, HB-EGF, a/bFGFs, KGF) and growth factor receptor alterations (EGFr, c-erbB2/3/4). From these, K-ras mutations detected in blood, stool and bile juice of patients at risk for pancreatic cancer seem to be more promising than p53 alterations as a more later step in carcinogenesis, although they are neither yet well established nor standardised by reliable assays. In contrast growth factor and growth factor receptor alterations mainly concerning signal transducing systems seem to reflect increased tumour aggressiveness, thus shorter survival and poorer prognosis thereby contributing in the selection of patients for more aggressive therapy."}

The contribution of carcinoembryonic antigen carcinoembryionic antigen for the effective management of colorectal cancer patients remains a controversial issue. The aim of this study is to attempt to get some valid answers to its function in the diagnosis, prognosis, and overall management of colorectal cancer patients. A retrospective review of colorectal cancer patients managed and prospectively registered by the authors between 1985 and 1998 was performed. Serum carcinoembryionic antigen levels were determined preoperatively in 209 patients with primary colorectal cancer and postoperatively in 196 patients who had undergone curative resection of their tumors, according to a fixed schedule. A maximum value of 5 ng/ml was accepted as being normal. With the exception of endoscopy, all other diagnostic techniques were only used after an abnormal carcinoembryionic antigen result (a raised value found twice consecutively). carcinoembryionic antigen preoperative values were raised only in 40 percent of patients and were related to disease stage, with the highest values found in patients with Stage IV disease. However, an elevated preoperative carcinoembryionic antigen value had a very marked prognostic importance, with a statistically significant difference in survival curves (Kaplan-Meier); the same was valid for curatively resected patients (Stages I, II, and III) and for Stages II and III patients considered separately. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards technique confirmed these results, showing preoperative carcinoembryionic antigen to have an independent prognostic value, with a relative risk of recurrence of 3.74 for patients with raised preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels. In postoperative follow-up, carcinoembryionic antigen elevation was found to be a very accurate marker of recurrence (sensitivity, 77 percent; specificity, 98 percent), mainly in liver metastasis (sensitivity, 100 percent), and the best marker of asymptomatic recurrence (63 percent of cases). However, carcinoembryionic antigen's impact on overall survival was negligible because of the poor results of surgical treatment of recurrences. Preoperative carcinoembryionic antigen is a very important prognostic indicator and should be considered in future trials. Postoperative carcinoembryionic antigen elevation is a very sensitive marker of recurrence and even of asymptomatic recurrence, but its impact on overall survival does not seem to be relevant. Nevertheless, carcinoembryionic antigen should continue to be used in colorectal cancer patients until better methods of diagnosis and treatment of recurrence are developed."}

Thus, from July 1997, he was treated with 5'-DFUR (800 mg/day) + MMC (4 mg/2 weeks). After 3 months of therapy, the chest CT examination showed an extreme reduction of the pulmonary lesion, and at 5 months the lesion was even smaller. Presently, after 7 months of therapy, the lesion remains stable. His CEA level is 1.0-2.6 ng/ml. After 4 months of treatment he had mild anorexia, which was alleviated by reducing the 5'-DFUR to 600 mg/day. No other adverse reaction was observed; the therapy was safely conducted on an outpatient basis."}

Nine patients with bilobular multiple metastases was treated. The number of nodules was 6.0 +/- 3.9 (range: 2-13), and the size was 2.1 +/- 1.0 cm (range: 0.5-4.8 cm) in diameter. RFA was performed using a RF generator operating at 460 kHz with a 15-gauge, 4-prong custom RF needle. Treatment temperature was kept at 90-110 degrees C for 5 min. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was administered by weekly 750-1250 mg/body/5 h as the regimen of HAI. During a 15.2-month follow-up period, 6 of 9 patients survived more than 1 year. Three of the 6 survived more than 2 years. Serum CEA level in 5 patients dropped from 24.5 +/- 9.5 ng/ml to 10.3 +/- 5.5 ng/ml. Local recurrence was observed in 5 patients and new lesions in 4. Extrahepatic recurrence was observed in 5 patients. There were no serious complications but one HAI-related cerebral thrombosis. Combined RFA with HAI would be effective and safe.

Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 are tumor markers expressed by colorectal cancers (CR), particularly in advanced cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of pre-operative elevated CEA and/or CA 19-9 levels for patients with CR. Blood samples were collected from 74 patients. CEA and CA 19-9 were determined by ELISA (normal range: 0-3 ng/ml for CEA and 0-37 U/ml for CA 19-9). All patients were followed-up for at least 30 months or until death. At the time of diagnosis, 42% of the patients had elevated serum levels of CEA and 35% of CA 19-9. Relapse was observed in 33 patients, 73% of whom had elevated CEA and/or CA 19-9 levels. Among patients without relapse, 68% and 73% had normal values of CEA and CA 19-9, respectively. Ninety-three percent of patients, who had CR recurrence during the first year, had an elevated CEA and/or CA 19-9 level, while 67% of the patients with CR after 1 year, had normal tumor markers. Elevated pre-operative serum CEA and CA 19-9 levels were each predictive of increased cancer mortality (p = 0.001 for CEA, p = 0.01 for CA 19-9). Raised CEA and CA 19-9 levels identify patients at high risk for CR and death and may be useful in selecting patients for adjuvant therapy."}

Radiolabeled antibodies and colorectal cancer imaging. Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) is coming into its own as an imaging modality in clinical oncology. Early experience with indium-111-labeled intact murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in colorectal cancer suggested that RIS images hepatic metastases poorly. Moreover, an antimurine immune response was frequently provoked, precluding multiple follow-up RIS studies in individual patients due to reticuloendothelial sequestration of the radioimmunoconjugate before tumor targeting could occur. Recent trials of technetium-99m-labeled antibody fragments and human MoAbs have demonstrated significant improvement in imaging efficacy, and repeated or serial imaging is possible because of the absence of associated immunogenicity. RIS is demonstrably more sensitive than conventional diagnostic modalities (CDM) such as computed tomography (CT) for detection of extrahepatic abdominal and pelvic colorectal carcinoma and is complementary to CDM in imaging liver metastases. In a surgical decision-making analysis comparing CT, RIS (IMMU-4 99mTc-Fab'; CEA-Scan), and CT plus RIS in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer, CT plus RIS improved correct prediction of resectability by 40% and correct prediction of unresectability by 100% compared with CT alone. At the present time, RIS used in combination with CDM contributes an incremental improvement in diagnostic accuracy in colorectal cancer patients with known or suspected recurrent disease. Basic and clinical research currently in progress promises to yield agents and methods that provide rapid high-resolution imaging, high tumor-to-background ratios in all organs at risk for tumor recurrence or metastasis, negligible immunogenicity and toxicity, and a significant further improvement in the accuracy of clinical decision making in oncology patients."}

The outcome of 134 patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal metastasis was studied. Current follow-up was available in 98 per cent of patients, for more than 5 years in 58 patients, and totaling 360 patient-years. Patients (52% male) had an average age of 62 +/- 1 years (standard error of the mean). Time lapse between the primary colon surgery and hepatic resection was a median of 16 months and a mean of 19 +/- 1 months. Thirty-two (24%) were operated on within 6 months for both their primary tumor and hepatic metastasis. Intensive care unit and total hospital length of stay were a median of 1 and 7 days, respectively. Pathology reports demonstrated that on average there were 2.0 +/- 0.1 lesions, with the largest lesion measuring 4.4 +/- 0.2 cm. In 72 per cent of patients, the lesions were found in one lobe only. CEA was elevated in 83 per cent of patients preoperatively and was 60 +/- 11 ng/mL before and 4.0 +/- 0.5 ng/mL after hepatic resection. Patient survival was 81 per cent at 1 year, 50 per cent at 3 years, 36 per cent at 5 years, and 23 per cent at 10 years. Actual 5- and 10-year survival was 22 of 58 (38%) patients and 4 of 21 (19%) patients respectively. Disease-free survival was 58 per cent at 1 year, 27 per cent at 3 years, 16 per cent at 5 years, and 12 per cent at 7 years. Survival was much better for one to four lesions than for five or more lesions (P < 0.01). Several other potential risk factors did not affect survival, including whether the patient received chemotherapy after hepatic resection. There were 36 (43%) patients who recurred with hepatic involvement only, 27 (32%) including hepatic involvement and 21 (25%) with nonhepatic involvement only.

Carcinoembryonic antigen is assumed from the results of several experiments to be associated with invasion of colorectal carcinoma by adhesion or contact inhibition. The patterns and the intensity of carcinoembryonic antigen distribution in colorectal carcinoma were assessed to verify whether they were correlated with malignant potential from those biologic characteristics. Carcinoembryonic antigen distribution was tested in the archival samples of 149 colorectal carcinomas by immunohistochemistry, using three characterized anti-carcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibodies: T84.66, PR1A3, and PR3B10. The distribution patterns in neoplastic tissue were categorized into unstained, apicoluminal, and diffuse cytoplasmic patterns. Tumor, invasive tumor margin, and tissue surrounding the tumor were examined. Although all three antibodies revealed a positive correlation, T84.66 showed better discrimination than the others. Although none of the negative staining of the tumor or invasive tumor margin showed recurrence, the apicoluminal pattern showed recurrence, and the diffuse pattern showed the most frequent recurrence (P < 0.01). Recurrence was also associated with staining intensity in the apicoluminal pattern in both the tumor and invasive tumor margin (P < 0.05). Infiltrative tumor growth and lymph node metastasis were more frequent in cases of positive staining in tissue surrounding the tumor. Patients with the apicoluminal pattern achieved longer survival than patients with the diffuse-cytoplasmic pattern in the invasive tumor margin (P = 0.024) by a multivariate analysis including tumor stage and histologic differentiation. The distribution of carcinoembryonic antigen in tumors and surrounding tissue seems to be closely correlated with invasiveness and metastatic behavior in colorectal carcinoma. Carcinoembryonic antigen immune staining can be considered as an efficient tool to determine groups with risk of recurrence."}

The purpose of this study was to examine the prognostic factors of patients undergoing curative hepatic resection for colorectal metastases. Between April 1984 and September 1997, 168 patients underwent curative hepatic resection for colorectal metastases. The clinicopathologic factors studied for prognostic value were gender, age, primary site, nodal status of primary tumor, time of metastases, preoperative serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen, hepatic tumor size and distribution, number of metastases, type of hepatic resection, resection margin, presence of micrometastases in resected specimen and microscopic fibrous pseudocapsule between the hepatic tumor and surrounding hepatic parenchyma, nodal status of hepatoduodenal ligament, adjuvant regional chemotherapy, and perioperative transfusion. The overall survival was 42 percent at three years and 26 percent at five years, including a 3.5 percent 60-day surgical mortality rate. Thirty-one percent of patients had micrometastases located at a median distance of 3 mm from the metastatic tumor edge. Presence of microscopic fibrous pseudocapsule was observed in 28 percent of patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that significant prognostic factors for survival were nodal status of primary tumor, number of metastases, resection margin, microscopic fibrous pseudocapsule, and adjuvant regional chemotherapy. We conclude that 1) hepatic resection is effective in select patients with colorectal metastases; 2) adequate resection margin and adjuvant regional chemotherapy can improve outcome; and 3) microscopic fibrous pseudocapsule may offer additional postoperative information as an independent prognostic factor."}

The histological examination of the atrial tumor disclosed areas of highly vascularized myxoid stroma with cells strongly reactive for vimentin. Multiple mucoid spaces lined by a single layer of goblet cells were scattered among those typical areas of myxoma. No nuclear atypia was observed. Cytoplasm of the glandular cells was immunoreactive for epithelial antisera (keratin, EMA), CEA and CA19.9. Two years later, the patient was doing well, with no local recurrence of the cardiac myxoma and no secondary location of the colonic adenocarcinoma. The histological characteristics, the absence of atypia, the absence of tumoral extension or neoplastic lymphatic vascular thrombi in the pedicle or in the interatrial septum, and the finding of typical myxomatous areas supported the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma with glandular component. To our knowledge, 21 cases of myxoma with glandular mucinous component, focal or prominent, have been previously published in the literature. These myxoma were generally sporadic cases with the same clinical features and prognosis as typical myxoma. Immunoreactivity of these glandular structures was constant for epithelial markers.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a new therapeutic method for management of solid tumors. We report here our experience in the use of this technique for management of primary and secondary unresectable liver cancers. Thirty-five patients with liver cancers were considered not suitable for curative resection at presentation: 8 with primary hepatocellular carcinoma ([HCC] 6 HCC and 2 fibrolamellar); 27 with metastatic liver cancer (17 colorectal carcinoma and 10 others). They were treated either with radiofrequency heat ablation (Radionics Europe N.V., Wettdren, Belgium) alone percutaneously and/or intraoperatively or in conjunction with surgical resections. The quality of RFA was based on the subjective feeling of whether the tumor was completely destroyed or not. The effectiveness of RFA was assessed according to clinical findings, radiographic images, and tumor markers at follow-up. In 8 primary liver cases, 4 patients with a high level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) benefited from the RFA with a 83.3% to 99.7% reduction of AFP. One with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma died 2 months after an incomplete percutaneous RFA from recurrence. The rest all had stable disease at the time of follow-up (mean 10.4 months). In patients with colorectal liver metastases, there were 4 deaths: 1 patient died postoperatively on the 30th day from a severe chest infection having shown a considerable reduction of carcinoembryonic antigen level (CEA, 8 versus 36 microg/L); 3 died from local and systemic disease, 1 at 12 months and 2 at 1 month, having had an incomplete RFA. The others had stable disease at follow-up (mean 7.6 months). Five patients underwent liver resections successfully with the application of RFA for residual lesions in the remaining contralateral lobe. In 10 patients with other liver tumors, 7 patients had stable disease at follow-up (mean 13.4 months); 1 patient had evidence of local and systemic recurrence 10 months after surgical resections with the intraoperative RFA and 2 patients died of systemic recurrence of disease 3 and 6 months after RFA alone. Two patients had liver resections in conjunction with the intraoperative RFA. The mean follow-up in our series was 8.5 months. Radiofrequency heat ablation is useful as a primary treatment for unresectable liver cancers. The procedure can be used to treat the small residual tumor load in the contralateral lobe following liver resection in those considered unresectable at the first presentation. This new therapeutic strategy seems to increase surgical resectability in patients judged unresectable."}

All inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician/supplier Medicare claims from 6 months after diagnosis through 1994 were examined for follow-up procedures of interest. Procedure use during follow-up was compared across patient groups using both bivariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 5716 patients were identified, with 1.3% found to have developed subsequent primary tumors of the colon or rectum, and 74% surviving through 1994. One or more procedures of interest were performed in 88% of patients; the most commonly performed tests were liver enzymes, chest X-rays, colonoscopy, and computed tomography scans. Lower rates of testing generally were observed with older age groups, patients with fewer comorbidities, and patients who did not survive through the follow-up period. Among all procedures studied, there also was significant variation in the rates of testing across the 9 SEER areas, varying from 1.5-fold to 3.6-fold.

In this study, we have compared the profiles of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) subsets and serum cytokine levels of healthy individuals with those of patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma before starting regional chemoimmunotherapy. Since the therapeutic responses are limited only to a subset of patients, we hypothesize that the initial status of immunity and individual immune response to a tumor might be significant to the therapeutic outcome. Cellular and humoral immunological parameters were compared between 10 patients with colorectal cancer metastases to the liver responding and non-responding to regional intra-arterial chemo-immunotherapy, and 5 healty individuals. Analyses included a flow cytometric immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD25, CD28, CD56, CD57, CD80 and HLA.DR), estimation of serum cytokine levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and other immunological parameters are soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), gastrointestinal cancer-associated antigen (CA 19-9), and C-reactive acute phase protein (CRP). A significantly lower proportion of CD8 lymphocytes and a trend for decreased CD19, CD28 and CD80 was detected among colorectal cancer patients before liver-directed chemotherapy compared to healthy controls. The cancer patients showed a significantly increased population of peripheral NK cells as detected by both CD56+ and CD57+ phenotypes. Elevated serum levels of CRP, IL-4 and TNF-alpha, sIL-2R, but not IL-2, were also demonstrated in cancer patients as compared to controls. Activated CD25+ lymphocytes correlated negatively with CD28+ lymphocytes (r = -0.68, p < 0.01) and less significantly with CD4+ lymphocytes (r = -0.56, p < 0.05). The CD8+ cytotoxic cell subset might be negatively influenced by serum IL-4 (r = -0.57, p < 0.05). Positive correlation was found between sIL-2R and CRP (r = -0.78, p < 0.01), and between sIL-2R and TNF-alpha (r = 0.64, p < 0.05) serum levels in patients with progressive disease during the course of therapy, the initial proportions of CD4+, CD19+ and CD28+ lymphocytes were significantly lower than those among responders. Among humoral parameters, only sIL-2R showed a marginal correlation with therapeutic response, being more elevated among non-responding patients. Pre-treatment serum levels of CEA and CA 19-9 showed correlation with neither therapeutic response nor with any of the cellular or humoral immunological parameters analyzed. The results may serve as an initial guideline to open a discussion on the rationale of such a panel of tests, hopefully leading to standardized laboratory pre-selection and monitoring of patients treated with regional chemoimmunotherapy."}

Multivariate Cox analysis including serum YKL-40, serum CEA, Dukes' stage, age and gender showed that high YKL-40 was an independent prognostic variable for short survival (HR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.8, P = 0.007). These results suggest that YKL-40 may play an important role in tumour invasion."}

Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) is being used increasingly as a new investigation in the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer. This study assessed the efficacy of 99mTc-radiolabelled PR1A3 scanning in a cohort of patients with possible recurrent colorectal cancer and the effects of scan interpretation on subsequent clinical management. The scans and case notes of patients scanned over a 3-year period were reviewed. Forty-seven scans in 40 patients were available for analysis. In 39 instances in which scan interpretation could be verified accurately, sensitivity for recurrent colorectal cancer was 22 of 23 (96 per cent), specificity for recurrent colorectal cancer was eight of 16 (50 per cent), positive predictive value for recurrence was 22 of 30 (73 per cent) and negative predictive value for recurrence was eight of nine (89 per cent). In 16 of the 40 patients, scan interpretation strengthened a management decision or altered management. This was beneficial to ten patients and possibly detrimental to six. This study demonstrated that RIS is sensitive in the detection of recurrent colorectal cancer and benefited the patient in one-quarter of cases. For the majority of patients, accurate detection of recurrent disease cannot be followed by curative therapy, but there is an important subgroup of patients in whom RIS alters management beneficially. However, a randomized prospective study is needed to confirm this."}

This retrospective review aimed to assess the incidence of local recurrence at the cryosite, hepatic and extrahepatic recurrence and the corresponding disease-free intervals. Prognostic indicators following hepatic cryotherapy were also identified. Eighty-five patients underwent complete cryotreatment of colorectal liver metastases between April 1990 and May 1997. Possible prognostic indicators were tested for their impact on the disease-free interval at the cryosite, liver disease-free survival and overall disease-free survival with univariate and multivariate analysis. At a median follow-up of 22 months 66 patients developed tumour recurrence: 18 in the liver only; 15 in the liver and lung; 22 in the liver and extrapulmonary areas; and 11 at extrahepatic sites only. Local recurrence at the cryosite occurred in 28 patients. Cryotreated metastases larger than 3 cm were associated with a shorter disease-free interval at the cryosite and liver disease-free survival; persistently raised serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels after operation were associated with shorter liver disease-free and overall disease-free intervals in multivariate analysis. Improvements in probe placement and monitoring of the freezing process are required to allow successful treatment of large liver metastases. A failure in complete postoperative CEA response indicates that hepatic or extrahepatic disease was not detected before operation, which may be avoided with better staging procedures."}

This combination therapy was safely carried out on an outpatient basis. The degrees of recovery of the left lower limb pain and edema, and of serum CEA reduction were comparable to those in high-dose chemotherapy alone. No significant adverse effects were encountered in the thermo-chemotherapy attempted. Since hyperthermic treatment enhances the cytotoxic effects of CPT-11 in vitro, topical hyperthermia with low-dose CPT-11 therapy may produce a response comparable to that in high-dose CPT-11 chemotherapy alone. However, an optimal dose and comparative study with other chemotherapeutic agents would be needed.

This multicenter, Phase II trial was performed to evaluate the antitumor activity and toxicity of irinotecan (CPT-11) in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma that had recurred or progressed after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. CPT-11 was given as a 90-minute intravenous infusion in repeated 6-week (42-day) courses comprising weekly treatment for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest. Tumor measurements were obtained after every second course of therapy. Toxicity was assessed weekly using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. A total of 166 patients were entered into the trial. The first 64 patients received a starting dose of 125 mg/m2. An additional 102 patients were enrolled at a starting dose of 100 mg/m2 to determine whether a reduction in the starting dose would result in lower toxicity without sacrificing efficacy. Objective responses to CPT-11 were observed in 18 patients (1 complete response and 17 partial responses) (response rate [RR] = 10.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1-15.6%). An additional 67 patients (40.4%) had stable disease as their best response. At the 125 mg/m2 starting dose, the RR was 14.1% (9 of 64 patients; 95% CI, 5.5-22.6%). Among patients given a starting dose of 100 mg/m2, the RR was 8.8% (9 of 102 patients; 95% CI, 3.3-14.3%). The overall median survival was 9.9 months (range, 0.3-36.8 months). The most frequently observed Grade 3/4 toxicities were gastrointestinal events (i.e., diarrhea [27.1%], nausea [15.1%], emesis [9.6%], abdominal cramping [22.2%], and neutropenia [19.9%]). There were no significant differences in the frequencies of Grade 3/4 toxicities between the 125 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 starting dose levels except for Grade 3/4 emesis (21.9% vs. 2%; P < 0.001). Patients age > or = 65 years were twice as likely (38.6% vs. 18.8%; P < 0.008) to develop Grade 3/4 diarrhea compared with younger patients when all courses of therapy were evaluated. However, older age did not significantly predict for a higher incidence of first-course diarrhea (25.0% vs. 14.7%; P = 0.106). CPT-11 can induce tumor regression in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma that has progressed during or shortly after 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Gastrointestinal events and neutropenia were the most common serious toxicities. Given the trend toward a higher response rate without substantially greater toxicity, 125 mg/m2 has been selected as the preferred starting dose for further studies. Careful attention to appropriate CPT-11 dose modification and early intervention with loperamide may be especially important in elderly patients."}

A 10-year, retrospective analysis of 131 patients who underwent exploration with curative intent for local recurrence after radical resection of rectal carcinomas, in a single referral institution, was performed. Preoperative and pathological factors were examined for their ability to predict postresection survival rates and resectability. The overall 5-year survival rate for patients who underwent exploration with curative intent was 24%. Resection of recurrent disease was possible for 103 of 131 (79%) patients, with a resulting 5-year survival rate of 31%. Patients who were treated initially with abdomino-perineal resection (n = 35) presented later and were less likely to have resectable tumors than were those treated initially with some form of sphincter-preserving resection (n = 96). Among patients who could undergo resection, normal carcinoembryonic antigen levels and recurrent disease limited to the bowel wall were both favorable features. Surgical salvage of local recurrence after radical resection of rectal carcinoma can be performed safely and can result in substantial long-term survival benefits for selected patients."}

In 103 patients, the discordances between FDG-PET and CDM results were identified and related to the final diagnosis obtained by histopathology or clinical follow-up (> 1 year). All FDG-PET studies were reviewed with full knowledge of the CDM findings. In a region-based analysis, discordances between CDM and FDG-PET findings were found in 40 of 412 regions (10%). In these, FDG-PET had additional diagnostic value in 14 of 16 locoregional, six of seven hepatic, seven of eight abdominal, and eight of nine extra-abdominal regions. In a patient-based analysis, CDM categorized a subgroup of 60 patients as having resectable recurrent disease limited to the liver (n = 37) or locoregional region (n = 23). In 13 of these patients, there were discordant FDG-PET findings, detecting additional tumor sites in nine patients and excluding disease in three patients and yielding an additional diagnostic value in 20% of the patients. A second subgroup consisted of 13 patients with inconclusive CDM findings (n = 5) or with elevated plasma carcinoembryonic antigen levels and an otherwise negative conventional work-up (n = 8). In these patients, FDG-PET results were correct in eight of nine discordances, yielding a positive additional diagnostic value in 62% of the patients.

The role of carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) in monitoring early detection of recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer, and its impact on resectability rate and patient survival remains controversial. Our objective was to determine any association between the preoperative level of CEA and prognosis, and the resectability and survival by method of diagnosis of colorectal hepatic metastases. We analyzed patients who underwent exploration for hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer over a 15-year period. The patient population consisted of those patients who had undergone primary colon or rectal resection and were followed up with serial CEA levels and of patients who were followed up with physical examination, liver function tests (LFTs) or computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis that led to the diagnosis of liver metastases. Also included in the study were patients who were diagnosed with liver metastases at the time of the primary colon or rectal resection and underwent planned hepatic resection at a later time. Three hundred and one (301) patients who underwent a total of 345 planned hepatic resections for metastatic colorectal cancer between January 1978 and December 1993 were included in this analysis. The median preoperative CEA level was 24.8 ng/mL in the resected group, 53.0 ng/mL in the incomplete resection group, and 49.1 ng/mL in the nonresected group (P = 0.02). More of the patients who had a preoperative CEA < or =30 ng/mL were in the resected group, while those who had a preoperative CEA >30 ng/mL were likely to be in the nonresected group (P = 0.002). The median survival was 25 months for patients with a preoperative CEA level < or =30 ng/mL and 17 months for patients with a preoperative CEA >30 ng/mL (P = 0.0005). The resectability rate and the survival of patients by method of diagnosing liver metastases-rising CEA versus history and physical, elevated LFTs, CT scan versus diagnosis at the time of primary resection-was not significant (P = 0.06 and P = 0.19, respectively). Given the nonstandardized retrospective nature of the study cohort and relative small groups of patients, the power to detect small differences in survival by method of diagnosis is limited. In the complete resection group of patients with unilobar liver disease (5-year survival of 28.8%) there was no difference in survival between those patients who had normal preoperative CEA and those who had elevated preoperative CEA, and approximately 90% of them had an abnormal preoperative serum CEA level. CEA is useful in the preoperative evaluation of patients with hepatic colorectal metastases for assessing prognosis and is complimentary to history and physical examination in the diagnosis of liver metastases. Patients with colorectal liver metastases and preoperative CEA < or =30 ng/mL are more likely to be resectable, and they have the longest survival."}

Marimastat is a specific inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases that has been shown to be effective in cancer models. A pilot, escalating-dose study of oral marimastat was performed in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer, in whom evaluation of serological response was made by measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of 4 weeks administration of marimastat, and determined a dose range producing detectable serological effects. Patients were recruited with a serum CEA level greater than 5 ng ml(-1), and rising by more than 25% over a 4-week screening period. Patients were treated for 28 days and entered into a continuation protocol if a serological response or clinical benefit was observed. Pharmacokinetic and safety data determined that groups of patients were recruited sequentially at 25 mg and 50 mg twice daily, and, thereafter, 10 mg twice daily, 10 mg once daily, 5 mg once daily and 20 mg once daily. A biological effect (BE) was defined as a CEA value on day 28 no greater than on day 0; a partial biological effect (PBE) was defined as a rise in CEA over the 28-day treatment period of less than 25%. Of 70 patients recruited, 63 completed the 28-day treatment period, and 55 were eligible for cancer antigen analysis. Examination of the dose-effect relationships provides evidence for a causal relationship between marimastat and biological effects: the proportion of patients with BE or PBE was higher with twice daily dosing (16 out of 25, 64%) than with once daily dosing (11 out of 30, 37%) (P = 0.043, chi2 test). Furthermore, the median rates of rise of CEA fell markedly during treatment compared with the screening period for patients receiving twice daily marimastat (P<0.0001), but not for patients receiving marimastat once daily (P = 0.25). Musculoskeletal adverse events emerged as the principal drug-related toxicity of marimastat, occurring in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. It was concluded that marimastat was associated with dose-dependent biological effects in cancer patients. The occurrence of musculoskeletal side-effects define 25 mg twice daily as the upper limit of the dose range for continuous use in further studies. Therefore, a dose range of 20 mg once daily to 25 mg twice daily seems appropriate for further studies, which should aim to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in terms of conventional clinical end points and describe the long-term tolerability of this novel agent."}

The onset of immunological reaction against colorectal carcinoma is based on superficial changes in the malignant cell components following the formation of antigen structures. This explains the interest in the issue and defines the aim of the study. Over a 5-year period, in the Emergency Surgery Clinic, 86 patients with histologically diagnosed colorectal carcinoma (46 men and 40 women) are examined prior to surgery, and 107 patients (55 men and 52 women)--after the operation. The tumor markers CEA, CA 19-9, AFP and immunoglobulin IgA are tested using ELISA and RIA methods. Conventional ultrasound, scintigraphic and CT studies are carried out to detect liver metastases. The obtained results undergo statistical processing with correlation analysis and sensitivity and specificity coefficients. Among those examined preoperatively elevated CEA levels (CEA > 2.5 ng/ml) are recorded in 42 cases (48.9%), and for CA 19-9 (CA 19-9 > 37 E/ml)--in 40 (46.5%). From the patients with complicated colorectal carcinoma in the postoperative period 83 are clinically healthy (77.6%); of the latter marker-positive are 16 (19.3%), and marker-negative--67 (80.7%). Relapses and metastases are registered in 24 cases (22.4%) of which marker-positive--19 (79.2%). Liver and abdominal lymph node metastases are detected by US, scintigraphy and CT study. All three imaging methods contribute to diagnose liver metastases in 14 patients (13%). In 32 patients (18 men and 14 women) postsurgical monitoring of immunological IgA levels and tumor markers is done over period ranging from 7-10 days to 2 years postoperatively. Correlative dependences between IgA and CEA (R = +0.99), and between IgA and CA 19-9 (R = +0.97) are also documented. The sensitivity of both markers (CEA and CA 19-9) is low, varying between 38 and 51 per cent, with specificity amounting to 61-67 per cent. The paradoxically high elevation of tumor markers prior to operation shows a constant decrease at 3 months after surgery. 1. The sensitivity of both markers (CEA and CA 19-9) is low (38-51%), and that is why their use in screening examinations lacks clinical relevance. 2. CEA specificity is by no means high (61-67%), and it may become positive in a number of nononcological diseases (liver cirrhosis and hepatitis, inflammation diseases of GIT and lungs). 3. Plasma CEA and CA 19-9 levels correlate well with the neoplastic process progression/regression. 4. Preoperative CEA level has a prognostic value for postsurgical relapses. 5. High IgA levels are indicators for relapses or metastases from colorectal carcinoma. 6. Tumor histological verification correlates also with the high CEA levels and with the depth of tumor infiltration into the intestinal wall. 7. The dynamic assessment of tumor markers postoperatively has a high informative value in all colorectal carcinoma patients. 8. Pre- and postoperative high CEA levels are observed in patients assigned to the poor prognosis group, and should be given adjuvant therapy."}

The results revealed increased preoperative CEA in only 24% of the subjects, and that this increment was correlated with subsequent more advanced tumor stage and a higher recurrence rate (P < 0.01). The postoperative CEA level exceeded the threshold in 71% of the patients affected by recurrence, 94.4% of whom developed liver metastases and 50%, nonhepatic recurrence. This marker showed elevated sensitivity for liver metastases (99%), whereas the sensitivity was lower for nonhepatic recurrence of the disease (94%). Thus, we concluded that CEA monitoring can be useful for preoperative colorectal tumor grading, even if its validity in the early diagnosis of recurrence is problematic, especially in terms of radical repeated surgery and survival."}

All the additional RIGS-detected tumor sites were locoregional recurrences resectable for cure; conversely, no diagnostic improvements were shown in patients with liver metastases. Resection for cure was obtained by this approach in 9 of 16 patients (56.2%). Two patients without disease at the exploratory laparotomy recurred within 2 months at sites away from the abdomen. RIGS improved the results of colorectal cancer CEA-guided second-look procedures in asymptomatic patients by recruiting one-third of patients to curative resections."}

Thirty-four patients (Group B) were given monoclonal antibody FO23C5, an F(ab')2 which reacts with the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The use of F(ab')2 antibodies ensured a lower time interval from the preoperative injection of the radiolabeled MAb to surgery. This interval was 22.7 days for Group A patients and 10.9 days for Group B patients. The correct RIGS identification of tumor sites occurred in 80.4% of Group A patients and in 92.6% of Group B patients. Additional information capable of modifying surgical strategy was obtained in 23.3% of Group A patients and in 8.8% of Group B patients. This difference was due to the different patterns of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the two MAbs. Although FO23C5 yields an improved diagnostic resolution for macroscopic tumor sites, we believe that B72.3 or other whole IgG1 should be the first choice for RIGS in recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer patients."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was first described more than three decades ago, when its presence was demonstrated in fetal gut tissue and in tumors from the gastrointestinal tract. Subsequently, CEA was detected in the circulation of patients and recognized as a serum marker for colorectal cancer. In the early diagnosis of disease recurrence following surgical resection, a serial increase in CEA level is the first evidence of tumor. In patients with disseminated tumors, serial determinations are useful for monitoring response to therapy. Carcinoembryonic antigen values decrease with effective treatment, while they increase with disease refractory to therapy or progressive metastases, yet the utility of CEA in the management of patients with advanced colorectal cancer remains controversial."}

The ability of computed tomographic and HumaSPECT-Tc imaging to define the extent of disease and to predict resectability was evaluated based on surgical and histopathologic results. In patients with recurrent or metastatic disease (170 evaluable patients), the accuracy of predicting nonresectability of disease was significantly greater (P < 0.001) for HumaSPECT-Tc than for computed tomography (60 vs 29 percent). Computed tomography understaged 41 percent of patients believed to have resectable disease compared with 27 percent for HumaSPECT-Tc (P < 0.001). In occult disease patients (29 computed tomographic and 28 HumaSPECT-Tc evaluable patients), the overall accuracy of predicting resectability/nonresectability was 6 percent for HumaSPECT-Tc compared with 24 percent from computed tomography. Administration of HumaSPECT-Tc had no effect on monoclonal antibody-based in vitro diagnostic assays. Only a single patient demonstrated an anti-antibody response (90 ng/ml) at nine weeks postinfusion.

Hepatic cryotherapy has been used as a treatment of nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer in almost 1000 patients worldwide, and its safety and efficacy are well established. However, tumor eventually recurs in most patients and they die of their disease. The knowledge of prognostic factors would allow the selection of patients who are more likely to benefit from this treatment and patients who may need additional treatment. Between April 1990 and May 1997, 195 patients were treated with hepatic cryotherapy. Out of this group, the authors identified 116 patients with colorectal cancer who received cryotherapy for ablation of liver metastases. Survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, using the log-rank test for univariate analysis for significance of possible prognostic factors. For multivariate analysis, a Cox regression was used. One patient (0.9%) died of postoperative myocardial infarction. The total perioperative morbidity rate was 27.6%. Median survival and the 5-year survival rate were 26 months and 13.4%. The following factors were identified as independently associated with a favorable outcome: low presurgical serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), small (< or =3 cm) diameter of cryoablated metastases, absence of untreated extrahepatic disease at laparotomy, absence of nodal involvement at primary resection, complete cryotreatment, synchronous development of liver metastases, and good or moderate differentiation of the primary tumor. Although univariate analysis suggested a favorable prognosis in patients who did not receive blood transfusion during surgery and patients younger than 51 years, this was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. In addition, normalization of the serum CEA level after treatment was an important prognostic marker in the subgroup of patients with elevated serum CEA levels before surgery. Hepatic cryotherapy is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer, with promising results regarding survival. The prognostic factors established in this series may allow better patient selection to improve the outcome in suitable patients."}

Follow-up testing was performed according to protocol guidelines, with the cost of each test equal to 1995 Medicare reimbursement. Follow-up was defined as the time to recurrence for the 421 patients in whom disease recurred (mean 18.6 months) or up to 5 years for the additional 930 patients in whom disease did not recur (mean 38.6 months). Patients were divided into three categories: nonrecurrent, recurrent but not resectable, and recurrent but resectable with curative intent.

Currently CEA is the most accurate tumor marker for colorectal cancer. Preoperative determination of this marker can assist staging, treatment planning and in particular postoperative follow-up of colorectal cancer. Postoperative CEA monitoring should be performed every 3 months. Further evaluation for local recurrence or metastatic disease is mandatory if elevated or increasing CEA levels occur after radical surgery. However, present data do not justify using CEA alone for postoperative follow-up and monitoring of adjuvant therapy. Molecular genetic techniques are now increasingly performed to detect genetic alterations that can be used as prognostic markers. In the future, identification and quantification of these genes may even be valuable in defining the susceptibility of healthy individuals for colorectal cancer."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been widely accepted as a tumor marker useful in the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer. When CEA levels are positive in gastric cancer patients, they could be useful prognostic indicators. However, the value of CEA as a tumor marker for gastric cancer remains a matter of controversy. We measured preoperative serum CEA levels in 196 patients with resectable gastric cancer between May 1986 and April 1996 and then evaluated the correlation between serum CEA levels, clinicopathologic features, and prognostic information. Serum levels of CEA were above the normal range in 29 of 196 (14.8%) surgically resected patients (range, 5.2-570 ng/mL). Among 100 early gastric cancers confined to the submucosal layer, only 7 patients (7.0%) had positive CEA levels, but among 96 advanced cancers, 22 patients (22.9%) had high CEA levels. The CEA positive patients had more macroscopically infiltrative tumors, a more prominent serosal invasion, more frequent lymph nodes involvement, and a more advanced stage than did the CEA negative patients. The 3- and 5-year cumulative disease-specific survival rates of patients positive for serum CEA were 39.6% and 31.7%, respectively; these rates for patients negative for CEA were 83.0% and 77.3%, respectively (p < 0.0001 for comparison of survival curves). In various clinicopathologic parameters, nine parameters (tumor size, macroscopic type, type and time of operation, Laur\u00e9n classification, depth of invasion, lymph node involvement, CEA, alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], and carbohydrate antigen [CA] 19-9) showed statistically significant differences in the cumulative survival rates. Of these nine parameters, independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis were depth of invasion (T1, 2 versus T3, 4, p < 0.0001), serum CEA levels (negative versus positive, p = 0.0003), and lymph node metastasis (negative versus positive, p = 0.0005). Preoperative serum CEA levels provide a predictive value in determining tumor stage and prognostic information for patients with potentially resectable gastric cancer during the preoperative period."}

E7010 is a novel sulfonamide which was discovered using slow-growing colon 38 carcinoma cells as a screening model. E7010 exhibits a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against human tumor xenografts. The mechanism of action is by arresting the progression of cells in M phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximum allowable dose (MAD), toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of single or 5-day repeated doses of E7010. In the single-dose study, E7010 was administered orally to 16 patients at doses ranging from 80 to 480 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy at a dose of 480 mg/m2. Hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities were mild. In the 5-day repeated-dose study, 41 patients were given E7010 at doses ranging from 30 to 240 mg/m2 per day. The dose-limiting toxicities were peripheral neuropathy and intestinal paralysis. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-dependent but not severe. Hematological toxicity was not dose-dependent. Pharmacokinetic analysis in the single-dose study showed a rapid increase in the plasma levels of the drug after administration, followed by disappearance with a t1/2 of 4.4-16.6 h. The variation in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) between the patients was small and increased in a dose-dependent manner. Total drug recovery in urine 72 h after administration was 77.8+/-11.4%, indicating that E7010 has favorable absorption and elimination profiles. The changes in the plasma levels of E7010 on day 5 in the 5-day repeated-dose study were almost the same as those on day 1, indicating that the drug did not accumulate. In the single-dose study, spinal cord metastasis exhibited a 74% reduction in a patient with uterine sarcoma and a minor response (MR) was observed in a pulmonary adenocarcinoma patient. In the 5-day repeated-dose study decreases in the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) were observed in a patient with stomach cancer and in a patient with recurrent uterine cervical carcinoma, respectively. The recommended phase II doses are 320 mg/m2 for a single-dose study and 200 mg/m2 per day for a 5-day repeated-dose study. Since the activity of E7010 is time-dependent, i.e. a certain concentration of E7010 is required for more than 12 h to suppress the growth of P388 leukemia cells, it is recommended that subsequent phase I/II studies be conducted using a divided dose schedule in order to maintain the blood level of E7010."}

A North American multi-institutional trial comparing postoperative chemotherapy plus follow-up with follow-up alone. 1247 patients with resected stage II and stage III colon cancer. The protocol mandated follow-up testing that could be supplemented at the discretion of treating physicians. Indications of recurrent disease were documented. Recurrence, resectable recurrence, surgical mortality, and survival were studied. 548 patients had recurrence of colon cancer. Salvage surgery was attempted in 222 patients (41%). In 109 patients (20%), curative-intent surgery was done for hepatic recurrence (28 patients), pulmonary metastasis (20 patients), local recurrence (24 patients), or recurrence at other sites (37 patients). Most curative-intent surgical procedures were motivated by follow-up testing (36 patients), elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level (41 patients), or symptoms (27 patients). The median follow-up time after curative-intent surgery exceeded 5 years; the estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate was 23%. A solitary lesion was a favorable prognostic factor. The surgical mortality rate was 2%. Curative-intent resections were done in 15 patients with second primary colorectal cancer; 12 of these patients have survived disease-free.

There were weak but significant correlations found between serum ELAM-1 and carcinoembryonic antigen or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Moreover, serum ELAM-1 increased before detecting the recurrence by imaging in five of seven recurrent colon cancer patients. These findings suggest that serum ELAM-1 could be a useful tumor marker for colon cancer, especially in synchronous and metaclonous metastasis."}

Early detection of recurrence after curative resection for primary colorectal cancer should improve patients' prognosis. However, the usefulness of postoperative surveillance programs has not been clarified yet. The present cohort study was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of systematic follow-up in patients with colorectal cancer who were operated on for cure, regarding both rate of tumor recurrence amenable to curative-intent surgery and rate of survival. One hundred ninety-nine colorectal cancer patients who underwent radical primary surgery were followed according a well-defined postoperative surveillance program, which consisted of laboratory studies (including serum carcinoembryonic antigen assay) every three months, physical examination and abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography every six months, and chest radiograph and total colonoscopy once per year. Cohorts were defined according to patients' compliance with the proposed follow-up program. A multivariate regression model was constructed to predict survival. One hundred forty patients were considered to be compliant with the surveillance program, whereas the remaining 59 patients occasionally attended follow-up investigations or did not comply at all. Although there were no differences in the overall recurrence rate (38 vs. 41 percent; P = 0.52), curative-intent reoperation was possible in 18 patients (34 percent) of those with tumor recurrence in the compliant cohort but in only 3 patients (12 percent) in the noncompliant cohort (P = 0.05). Similarly, the probability of survival was higher in the compliant cohort, both regarding overall (63 vs. 37 percent at 5 years; P < 0.001) and cancer-related (69 vs. 49 percent at 5 years; P < 0.02) rates. Cox regression analysis disclosed that only a more advanced TNM stage (odds ratio, 8.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.13-59.29) and noncompliance with the postoperative surveillance program (odds ratio, 2.32; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.50-3.60) had an independent negative impact on survival.

The aim a follow-up programme in patients with cancer is to detect relapse or metastases in an early asymptomatic stage. This is only useful if the diagnosis of recurrence has implications for treatment and if early treatment of recurrence leads to an improved prognosis. This is certainly the case for liver metastases of colon cancer. Surgical resection of localised liver metastases has a 25-30% 5-year survival. Early chemotherapy for non-resectable metastatic disease improves the survival and prolongs the symptom-free period in comparison with chemotherapy starting at the onset of symptoms. Follow-up for colorectal cancer should be offered to patients with the highest risk of recurrence and should consist of clinical examination, CEA monitoring, ultrasound of the liver, chest X-ray and periodic colonoscopy. Issues for further research are the determination of a follow-up programme with the highest sensitivity, the determination of the periodicity of follow-up, the search for prognostic factors for recurrence, cost issues and the final proof of a survival benefit in a large follow-up programme. Indirect evidence supports the need for a good follow-up programme for colorectal cancer focussing on the detection of liver metastases."}

To assess the risk of recurrence and accurately determine the spread of tumor cells, we examined lymph node micrometastases in a series of colorectal cancer patients. We examined 202 lymph nodes obtained from 13 colorectal cancer patients who underwent curative operation and were histologically diagnosed to be node-negative, using RT-PCR to amplify mRNAs for two epithelial markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 20 (CK-20). All the cases, including early stage patients, had micrometastases. A total of 102 among 202 lymph nodes (50.5%) were positive for either CEA or CK-20, or both (47.0, 40.1, and 36.6% respectively). Positive lymph nodes were spread along the courses of vascular trunks as well as being located in more distant regions. Even in histologically negative lymph nodes, there is a considerable possibility that micrometastases may exist. Their detection by RT-PCR may improve clinical staging and indications for cancer therapy. We should also take care in the choice of surgical approach."}

The nature of 'local recurrence' of rectal cancer remains unclear. Fifty-nine patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer who underwent extended repeat resections including total pelvic exenteration (39) and sacrectomy (43) were reviewed. Twelve patients had distant metastases before or at the time of repeat resection. The 5-year survival rate was 25 per cent. A second recurrence occurred in 45 patients including five of the eight 5-year survivors. Thirty-six of these recurrences had locoregional manifestations and 29 had distant metastases. Of 18 prognostic factors examined, the most significant determinant was the postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen doubling time (CEADT), followed by the preoperative CEADT, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and occurrence of distant metastases, in decreasing order. Late onset of first recurrence was also a favourable indicator. Thus, the growth rate of the tumour had a more profound impact on survival than the current extent of tumour progression. After operation the CEADT was reduced in patients with second recurrence (P = 0.05). Locally recurrent rectal cancer is a manifestation of disseminated disease spreading locoregionally and often to distant organs with a low probability of long-term cure. However, survival varies widely depending on the tumour growth rate, which is biologically predetermined and is also influenced by surgery."}

CEA doubling times were determined from semilogarithmic plots of CEA concentration time courses in 20 patients with recurrent gastric cancer and 17 with recurrent colorectal cancer. Gastric and colorectal carcinomas showed mean CEA doubling times of 229 days and 85 days, respectively. There were no significant differences with regard to patient age, tumor size, gross appearance and histological differentiation. However, women had shorter CEA doubling times than did men. Flow cytometric analysis showed that tumors with a higher proportion of cells in S-phase (> or = 15%) had significantly shorter CEA doubling times than those with a lower S-phase fraction (< 15%). There was a significant correlation between the CEA doubling time and the length of survival after the initial CEA concentration increase in patients with recurrent gastric and colorectal carcinomas. CEA doubling time predicts life expectancy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Differences in survival time are closely associated with variations in the biological aggressiveness of individual tumors."}

Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors. After 7 years of follow-up evaluation, treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .01; log-rank, P=.01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .04; log-rank, P=.07).

While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox's proportional hazard, P=.004; log-rank, P=.004), local relapses were not (Cox's proportional hazard, P=.65; log-rank, P=.52). This differential effect of 17-1A antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival. The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients. The therapeutic effect is maintained after 7 years of follow-up evaluation."}

The following 10 prognostic factors were correlated with recurrence and tumor-related mortality: patient factors: age, gender, and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level; tumor factors: location from the anal verge (< 6 cm vs. > or = 6 cm), T stage (T1 vs. T2), intratumoral blood vessel invasion (BVI), intratumoral lymphatic vessel invasion, presence of tumor ulceration, and histologic differentiation; and treatment-related factors: extent of surgical resection--abdominal perineal resection versus low anterior resection. Univariate analysis of the effect of the prognostic factors on recurrence and tumor-related mortality were performed by the method of Kaplan-Meier and log rank test. Independent prognostic factors were determined by a multivariate analysis performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The overall 5-year actuarial recurrence was 12% and tumor-related mortality was 10%. Independent predictors of recurrence were male gender and BVI. Independent predictors of tumor-related mortality were male gender, BVI, and poorly differentiated tumors.

Surgical therapy for colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the liver is the only potentially curable treatment. Careful patient selection of those with resectable liver-only metastatic disease is crucial to the success of surgical therapy. Two hundred forty-four consecutive patients undergoing curative hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively. Variables examined included sex, stage of primary lesion, size of liver lesion(s), number of lesions, disease-free interval, ploidy, differentiation, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, and operative factors such as resection margin, use of cryotherapy, intraoperative ultrasound, and blood loss. Surgical margin, number of lesions, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels significantly control prognosis. Patients with only one or two liver lesions, a 1-cm surgical margin, and low CEA levels have a 5-year disease-free survival rate of more than 30%. Disease-free interval, original stage, bilobar involvement, size of metastasis, differentiation, and ploidy were not significant predictors of recurrence. The pattern of failure correlates with surgical margin. Routine use of intraoperative ultrasound resulted in an increased incidence of negative surgical margin during the period examined. Surgical resection or cryotherapy of hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer is safe and curable in appropriately selected patients. Biologic factors, such as number of lesions and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, determine potential curability, and surgical margin governs the patterns of failure and outcome in potentially curable patients. Optimization of selection criteria and surgical resection margins will improve outcome."}

The study contained herein was undertaken to review and summarize the current literature on diagnostic and therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies in colorectal cancer. Limitations of traditional imaging techniques have encouraged development of targeted imaging strategies using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Diagnostic immunoscintigraphy can detect lesions not identified by conventional imaging modalities, although it has not proven useful in the management of primary colorectal cancers and in hepatic metastases. Immunoscintigraphy shows promise in cases of local recurrence and rising carcinoembryonic antigen values; however, the impact of immunoscintigraphy on clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness remains unproven. Radioimmunoguided surgery has been advocated as a method of more accurately detecting tumor extension and accomplishing radical resection. The technique remains controversial, and its use is not widespread. With respect to therapeutic applications, immunotherapy has most often been investigated in the setting of advanced stage disease. Results in this setting have been poor. In contrast, adjuvant immunotherapy after resection of Dukes C carcinoma has achieved convincing results, with improvements in survival comparable with that of adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant trials are now under way to examine the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies in the postoperative treatment of early-stage (II) tumors and the combination of monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy in advanced-stage (III) tumors. Bispecific antibodies, or immunoconjugates with cytokines or toxins, represent additional areas of interest and future investigations. At present, immunoscintigraphy is not sufficient to determine, by itself, resectability of colorectal tumor and has limited usefulness in select cases of recurrent cancer and possibly in cases of rising carcinoembryonic antigen values.

One approach to development of specific cancer immunotherapy relies on the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Induction of TAA-specific CTL could be used towards the eradication of established tumors, or to prevent their dissemination or recurrence after primary treatment. The present study identifies a set of CTL epitopes from TAA frequently found on solid epithelial tumors such as breast, lung and gastro-intestinal tumors. Specifically, HLA-A2.1 binding peptides from the MAGE2, MAGE3, HER-2/neu and CEA antigens were tested for their capacity to elicit in vitro anti-tumor CTL using lymphocytes from normal volunteers and autologous dendritic cells as antigen-presenting cells. A total of 6 new epitopes (MAGE2[10(157)], MAGE3[9(112)], CEA[9(691)], CEA[9(24)], HER2[9(435)] and HER2[9(5)]) were identified which were capable of specifically recognizing tumor cell lines lines expressing HLA-A2.1 and the corresponding TAA. In one case (CEA[9(24)]), induction of vigorous anti-tumor CTL responses required epitope engineering to increase HLA-A2.1 binding affinity. Finally, most of the newly identified epitopes (5 out of 6) were found to be highly crossreactive with other common HLA alleles of the A2 supertype (A2.2, A2.3, A2.6 and A6802), thus demonstrating their potential in providing broad and non-ethnically biased population coverage. The results are discussed in the context of the development of multi-epitope-based therapies with broad applicability for patients suffering from commonly found tumors."}

To assess the potential role of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in patients with unexplained rising carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels after the treatment of colorectal cancer. A rising CEA level after the resection of colorectal cancer is an early indicator of tumor recurrence. However, conventional imaging techniques have limited sensitivity for detecting recurrent disease in such patients. Especially after surgical intervention, FDG-PET is rapidly gaining an important role in establishing the extent of disease in the oncology patient. Twenty-two patients with abnormal CEA levels and normal results of conventional methods of tumor detection were studied with FDG-PET. The PET results were compared with pathologic findings (n = 9) and long-term radiologic and clinical follow-up (n = 13). FDG-PET was abnormal in 17 of 22 patients. Tissue sampling was available in 7 of these 17 patients; all of these had recurrent disease. Definitive curative surgical intervention was performed in four patients. Subsequent dedicated imaging findings and clinical course confirmed the presence of extensive disease in 8 of the remaining 10 patients; the PET results in the other 2 patients were considered falsely positive. FDG-PET was negative in 5 of 22 patients. No disease was found by tissue sampling (n = 2) and clinical follow-up (n = 3). Overall, the positive-predictive value for PET was 89%, (15 of 17) and the negative-predictive value was 100% (5 of 5). When conventional examinations are normal, FDG-PET is a valuable imaging tool in patients who have a rising CEA level after colorectal surgery."}

The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze survival and prognostic factors in 111 consecutive patients undergoing curative resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. In addition, the time periods 1971-1984 and 1985-1995 were compared; criteria for first liver resection did not change with time, whereas the attitude toward re-resection was more aggressive during the latter period. Operative mortality was 6% during 1971-1984 and 0% during 1985-1995 (3.6% for all patients). The crude 5-year actuarial survivals were 19% and 35% for patients operated during 1971-1984 and 1985-1995, respectively (25% for the whole period). Relapse at any site was observed in 52 patients (81%) operated during the first period and in 29 patients (67%) operated during the second period; re-resection was performed in 12 (23%) and 15 (52%) of these patients, respectively. Five-year survival after hepatic re-resection was 29% (no operative mortality). In the univariate analysis, significant determinants for long-term survival were, in descending order, a clear resection margin, high degree of fibrosis around the tumor, absence of extrahepatic metastases (including metastases to the liver hilum), use of an ultrasound dissector, low preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, year of resection (1985-1995), and low/moderate grade of liver tumor. There were no 5-year survivors when extrahepatic metastases were present, the liver tumor(s) had a low differentiation or satellites, or the resection margin was involved with tumor. In the multivariate analysis, the determinants were grade of liver tumor, absence of extrahepatic tumor, few intraoperative blood transfusions, low preoperative serum CEA level, and year of resection (1985-1995). It is concluded that: (1) an increased rate of hepatic re-resection was partly responsible for the improved outcome after liver resection for colorectal metastases during recent years; (2) patients with extrahepatic metastases did not benefit from liver resection; and (3) surgery should be performed with a clear resection margin and minimal blood loss."}

Twenty patients with bilobar disease confined to the liver (median 3; range 2-8 lesions) were treated in this way. Seventeen patients also received regional chemotherapy postoperatively. Morbidity was high, but there were no procedure-related deaths and only one patient's hospital stay exceeded 24 days.

A total of 406 lymph nodes obtained from 65 patients were analyzed by both histologic and molecular examination of CEA-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Peripheral blood samples from another 102 patients were also analyzed by CEA-specific RT-PCR. Patients were followed up prospectively for 24 +/- 12 months. Of 406 lymph nodes, the positive detection rate increased from 20% by histologic examination to 60% by RT-PCR examination. The recurrence rate was 40% in 15 cases showing positive results in both examinations, 14% in 29 cases showing histologically negative but RT-PCR positive results, and none in 21 cases showing negative results in both examinations. The positive detection rate for CEA mRNA in peripheral blood samples increased with advancing stage of disease. With respect to 62 curatively operated cases, CEA mRNA was detected in 12 cases. Four of these 12 cases developed metastatic disease after surgery whereas none of 50 cases negative by RT-PCR developed metastasis. It has been shown that RT-PCR is a powerful tool to detect CEA mRNA in the lymph nodes or the peripheral blood. This is potentially very useful to determine high-risk patients for metastasis. Serial analysis is warranted to assess the long-term significance of this method and its therapeutic and prognostic implications."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is expressed in a wide variety of adenocarcinomas, and it is well recognized that cancer patients are immunologically \"tolerant\" to CEA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether we could break immune tolerance to CEA by vaccinating patients with a monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody that is the internal image of CEA and to determine what impact this might have on patient survival. Twenty-four patients with advanced CEA-positive colorectal cancer who failed standard therapies except for two were entered into this Phase Ib trial. One patient was considered not assessable, because on the day of entering into the study, she was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia. Patients were treated with 1, 2, or 4 mg of aluminum hydroxide-precipitated 3H1 anti-idiotype antibody every other week for four injections and then monthly until tumor progression was observed. Immunological monitoring included humoral and cellular idiotypic and CEA responses, and all patients were evaluated for toxicity, response, and survival. Hyperimmune sera from 17 of 23 patients demonstrated an anti-anti-idiotypic Ab3 response, and 13 of these responses were demonstrated to be true anti-CEA responses (Ab1'). The antibody response was polyclonal, and 11 mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Ten patients had idiotypic T-cell responses, and five had specific T-cell responses to CEA. None of the patients had objective clinical responses, but overall median survival for the 23 evaluable patients was 11.3 months, with 44% 1-year survival (95% confidence interval, 23-64%). Toxicity was limited to local swelling and minimal pain. Anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody 3H1 that mimics CEA was able to break immune tolerance in the majority of treated patients. Overall survival of 11.3 months was comparable to other phase II data with advanced colorectal cancer patients treated with a variety of chemotherapy agents, including irinotecan, with considerably less toxicity. Although it is not clear that the vaccine itself had an impact on survival, this should be determined in a Phase III randomized trial."}

A local recurrence appeared in 26 patients (10.9%), a distant metastasis in 41 (17.1%), while in seven (2.9%) local and distant recurrences appeared simultaneously. Local recurrence was detected because of an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level in 15 patients (57.7%), during a scheduled endoscopy in four (15.4%) and because of symptoms in seven (26.9%). In seven patients (26.9%) a radical resection was possible.

The study was performed on 44 patients treated for advanced colorectal carcinoma by a weekly 8 h continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (1300 mg/m2) plus bolus injection of L-folinic acid (100 mg/m2). TSA, CEA and CA 19-9 levels were measured before and after 3 months of treatment and their variations analysed as a function of the response to the treatment. TSA levels of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma before treatment (959 +/- 265 mg/l) were significantly higher than those of 32 healthy people (584 +/- 99 mg/l). The percentage of patients with TSA concentration above the cut-off level (782 mg/l) was 73% before treatment and 23% after. All patients who experienced an objective response to the treatment (complete, partial or minor response) (n = 29) had a significant decrease of TSA levels (t = 5.96; P < 0.001). When the disease was considered as stabilised (n = 10), TSA changed slightly, but it increased with progressive disease (4 out of 5 patients). Changes in CEA and CA 19-9 did not correlate as well as TSA to the treatment efficacy. Initial levels of TSA did not permit prediction of the efficacy of the treatment since they were not significantly different between the five response groups. TSA seems to be more likely involved in tumour changes than in tumour volume. Its determination could provide useful information about the spreading and metastatic properties of the tumour. TSA normalisation is an indicator of probable tumour growth arrest and its elevation could be a marker of relapse."}

Ninety percent of the serum from treated patients without recurrence have normal serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels. We concluded that the sensitivity of carcinoembryonic antigen is lower in the diagnosis as described in others studies, mostly in patients with better prognosis. In the monitoring, patients with normal serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, probably have no recurrence of the disease.

In this study, the cost-effectiveness of this programme was addressed employing Norwegian cost data and data from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Clinical data from the existing English language literature was used in the analysis. The basic cost of the NGICG recommended programme was 1,232 Pounds per patient. Including extended investigation due to suspected relapse in 45% of cases, the figure raised to 1,943 Pounds per patient. The cost per life year saved was indicated to 9,525 Pounds-16,192 Pounds.

The efficacy of standardized follow-up examinations after surgery for colorectal carcinoma has been repeatedly questioned. Although many studies have assessed the value of different diagnostic tools none of these procedures proved to have a predictive value high enough to accurately predict the recurrence of disease and to justify its regular use in these patients. Even a combined diagnostic approach provided a benefit only for a minority of these patients (3.5 to 4.5%). Considering the physical and psychological strain imposed by this approach risk-adapted follow-up schemes are urgently needed. Prognostic parameters indicating the individual risk for disease recurrence can be deduced from increasing CEA values as well as from classification and grading of the primary tumor. Colonoscopy is an effective procedure for early detection of intraluminal relapse or metachronous tumors with potential impact on survival of the patient. An abdominal ultrasound study appears to be the method of choice for detection of metastasis of the liver due to its high sensitivity and low invasiveness. Other imaging procedures are not indicated in routine follow-up for colorectal carcinoma. It remains to be demonstrated whether molecular biology or new scintigraphic techniques will be helpful in follow-up examinations of patients with colorectal carcinomas."}

The contributions of nuclear imaging tests to the management of cancer are expanding, especially in terms of detection (staging and recurrence), diagnosis, and qualification of patients for certain forms of therapy, and particularly with regard to the tests' ability to identify tumors on a functional basis. This article is a selective review of the advances and clinical management applications of cancer imaging with radiolabeled antibodies (radioimmunodetection or immunoscintigraphy), with the objective of demonstrating how this new imaging technology can contribute to oncologic practice. The contribution of another functional imaging modality, positron emission tomography (PET), also is discussed. Radioimmunodetection and PET imaging have shown particular management contributions in patients with colorectal, breast, or lung carcinoma, as well as in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Two antibody imaging agents, OncoScint and CEA-Scan, currently are available for the detection of colorectal carcinoma, and have shown particular application for disease staging and disclosure of occult lesions. Each of these agents has different characteristics and potential applications. Recent results with CEA-Scan in patients with mammary carcinoma suggest that it may be a useful complementary tool to screening mammography by adding very high specificity. In patients with lung carcinoma, technetium-99m-labeled NR-LU-10 antibody has been shown to be useful in preoperative staging. LymphoScan is under investigation as a staging agent and for revealing residual disease in patients with NHL; it also provides, with a different radioisotope attached and in a humanized antibody form, a therapeutic option for patients with NHL. Similar results can be shown for PET, but this method may not provide the specificity of an antibody-based functional imaging agent, although PET may have a higher lesion sensitivity. Both radioimmunodetection and PET provide new exciting opportunities for earlier and more sensitive functional imaging tests for cancer. In contrast to PET, antibody agents also can serve to qualify a patient as a candidate for an antibody-based therapy."}

The objective was to determine the role of arcitumomab (CEA-Scan; Immunomedics, Morris Plains, NJ), an anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) Fab' labeled with technetium-99m, in the presurgical evaluation of patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Surgical resection is the only method known to cure recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinoma. The location and extent of disease must be determined before surgery. The role of antibody imaging, a new cancer detection modality, in preoperative evaluation for resection of locally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer has not been established, either alone or in combination with standard diagnostic modalities. In a blinded analysis of 209 patients with known or suspected colorectal cancer, the accuracy of arcitumomab, alone and combined with computed tomography (CT), was compared to that of CT for predicting abdominopelvic tumor resectability by correlating the results with surgical and histopathologic findings. Arcitumomab alone or combined with CT was found to be significantly more accurate for predicting surgical outcome than CT alone. When the results of CT and arcitumomab were concordant for abdominopelvic resectability, nonresectability, or absence of disease, the prediction was accurate in 67%, 100%, and 64%, respectively. Thus, the concordance for nonresectability (100% correct) may obviate the need for other diagnostic modalities or exploratory surgery. When the two tests were discordant, arcitumomab was correct substantially more often than CT. Because the liver is the most common site of distant metastasis in colorectal cancer, a subset of patients with hepatic disease was also analyzed; findings were similar to the overall resectability results. The product's safety profile was excellent: the incidence of induction of an immune response against arcitumomab was <1% and that of potentially adverse events was 1.2%. The accuracy of arcitumomab for assessing resectability status is greater than that of CT, both in all patients undergoing evaluation for curative abdominopelvic resection of colorectal cancer and in the subset of patients with suspected or proven liver metastases. The additional use of arcitumomab with CT potentially doubles the number of patients who could be saved the cost, morbidity, and mortality of unnecessary abdominopelvic surgery and increases those who are potentially resectable for cure by 40%."}

The patient was a 72-year-old woman who had undergone sigmoidectomy and partial hepatectomy on March 9, 1995, for advanced sigmoid cancer with liver metastasis. In December 1995, new foci were detected in the remaining liver. Intraoperative echography during reoperation revealed 6 foci in the right lobe, 2 in the left lobe and 1 in the caudate lobe. During reoperation, we performed partial hepatectomy at the left lobe metastases and microwave coagulation in the caudate lobe. A catheter was inserted into the right hepatic artery, and the right hepatic artery was ligated with the catheter. From 2 weeks after operation, CDDP (20 mg) and 5-FU (1,500 mg) were given weekly by infusion from the arterial root.

The imaging techniques used to follow-up patients submitted to surgery for colorectal cancers are presented as are their advantages and disadvantages. The sensitivity of ultrasonography (US) for postoperative surveillance of the liver varies considerably according to whether the absence or presence of metastases is sought (83%) or their exact number (53-82%). US is recommended by French clinicians as the standard follow-up examination whereas, American clinicians tend to discuss CT-Scan or MRI for the same purpose. Some authors advocate Doppler ultrasonography for the detection of liver metastases. Spiral CT-Scan offers better results than conventional CT and is now considered second in rank to US for follow-up studies. Its sensitivity exceeds 90% for metastases greater than 1 cm. IRM and arterial CT-scan are not applicable for follow-up but are sometimes indicated for difficult cases before hepatectomy. US is also an appropriate technique for postoperative exploration of the abdominal cavity. When the CEA level and the US examination are normal, this technique is sufficient. However, in dubious clinical or biological cases, US should be associated with a spiral CT-Scan. Most clinicians recommend a reference CT-Scan, two to four months after the resection and every 6 months for 2 years and then annually. The same follow-up strategy is advocated after abdominoperineal resection and for surveillance of the pelvis. The sensitivity of CT-Scan is between 69 and 88% but it is unable to differentiate recurrence from fibrosis. IRM, with a sensitivity of 90%, is the best method for overcoming with problems related to the differential diagnosis and particularly novel fast acquisition imaging and contrast agents. Ultrasonoendoscopy, repeated every 4 to 6 months after anterior resection, is also a useful examination for surveillance of the pelvis. PET-Scan has produced encouraging results for the detection of metastases and for the differential diagnosis between local recurrence and fibrosis. When available, this technique could become the \"gold standard\" for the surveillance of patients following surgery for colorectal cancers."}

The purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate the contribution of follow-up in resected colorectal cancer. One-thousand patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who underwent radial resection from January 1975 to January 1990 were prospectively divided into two groups: the first group (n = 442, 42%) entered a 5-year follow-up protocol and the second group (n = 558, 56%) was free to make unscheduled visits in case of symptoms. Recurrence was found in 31.5% of the patients in the first group compared with 33% in the second group. Chorioembryonic antigen was the most accurate test detecting recurrence: 77% of the cases (97% for hepatic metastasis). Surgical resection of recurrent tumors was performed in 37% of the group 1 patients (curative resection in 15%) and in 9% (curative resection in 1.5%) of the group 2 patients (p < 0.001). 5-year survival after recurrence in group 1 was 11.5% versus 1% in group 2 (p < 0.01).

Many immunohistochemical studies have investigated the relationship between immunohistochemical characteristics and histopathological findings in colorectal tumors. One of the most extensively studied markers has been tissue CEA, although the prognostic significance of this and other antigens is still uncertain. The authors report results relative to three tumoral antigens (carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA; tissue polypeptide antigen. TPA, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, CA 19-9) determined by immunohistochemical methods in tissue samples of 52 colorectal carcinomas. The relationship between the immunohistochemical characteristics of the neoplasms and the clinicopathologic parameters, as well as their influence on the prognosis of the patients, were examined. Positive CEA reaction has a significant relationship with grade of differentiation of the tumor while diffuse cellular expression of this antigen often indicates neoplasms extending beyond the intestinal wall and invading the lymph vessels. The number of tissue antigens expressed is significantly related to the extent of tumor spread through the intestinal wall. A greater incidence of recurrence and shorter disease-free interval and survival were observed in neoplasms that expressed tissue TPA antigen or more than one tissue antigens. In the present study the latter parameter has demonstrated to have independent prognostic significance for the disease-free interval. Immunohistochemical evaluation of antigens in colorectal carcinoma tissue shows a possible independent prognostic value of the antigenic heterogeneity of tumors, which could be related to their different biological behavior."}

Two-thirds of the patients undergo potentially curative surgery and almost half of them develop local or distant metastases. The follow-up of colorectal cancer patients involves four strategies: Educating the patients about the disease, symptoms of relapse, and risk of hereditariness; Early diagnosis of relapse, to make curative re-surgery possible; Diagnosis of metachronous/synchronous cancer(s); Recording the results of current surgical techniques. The Norwegian Gastrointestinal Cancer Group recommend a four-year follow-up programme (every third month for two years and then twice a year) of colorectal cancer patients. It is suggested that patients treated with low anterior resection are followed regularly by means of rectoscopy and local examination (digital or by ultrasound) undertaken by specialist (surgeon or gastroenterologist). The others should be followed up mainly by general practitioners. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-monitoring is suggested every third month for two years, and then every sixth month. Colonoscopy is recommended at one and four year follow-up. Patients with normal CEA levels prior to surgery should be evaluated by ultrasound of the liver every sixth month for four years."}

The diagnosis of colorectal cancer must be considered in the presence of suggestive symptoms and must be endoscopy. Assessment of operability, including chest x-ray, is completed by CEA determination and x-rays of the colon, looking for a synchronous lesion. Complementary assessments must answer 3 questions: what operation needs to be performed, is any preoperative adjuvant treatment indicated, do any prognostic factors need to be identified before the operation. The treatment of cancer of the colon is now clearly defined; intraoperative hepatic ultrasonography and histological examination of the resection specimen provide all of the necessary data in the majority of the cases. In the presence of a cancer of the rectum, various therapeutic alternatives are available according to the site and stage of the tumour. The complementary assessment includes biopsy to confirm the malignant nature of the lesion, and measurement of the distance of the lower pole from the anal margin (digital rectal examination, endoscopy). A more precise preoperative staging by ultrasonography, computed axial tomography or magnetic resonance is required when the clinician considers that the invasive nature of the lesion justifies preoperative radiotherapy. This precise staging is fully justified in the presence of a small rectal tumour amenable to local resection. Although infiltration of the rectal wall is now very clearly defined, formal identification of metastatic lymphadenopathy still remains hazardous. Finally, the search for distant metastases by invasive and/or expensive techniques is indicated when looking for contraindications to surgery (high-risk patients, surgery for recurrence and metastases). In other cases, the presence of metastases does not contraindicate a palliative colonic resection and intraoperative exploration allows reliable identification of any liver metastasis."}

To test this hypothesis we lauched the following feasibility-study the results of which are compared to those reported in the recent literature. We investigated 20 patients-six with rectum-, 14 with colon cancer, 24 hours before surgery they were intravenously given 1 ml of an fab-fragment-antibody to CEA, labeled with 25mCi of 99mTc (CEA-Scan). During surgery the radioactivity in lymph glands regionary for the tumors was measured and compared to the-much lower-activity in healthy nodes. For this we used a scintillation-probe (C-Trak). All lymph nodes of interest were-then excised and submitted to frozen section pathology. In 7/20 cases scintimetry led to an up-staging of the disease. In addition we found metastatic spread to lymph nodes that were basically not regionary for the primary tumor. Our results are confirmed by those of other investigators. Scintimetry can precisely identify even very small tumor deposits. So it leads to accurate staging when surgery is still on-going. In a next step the concept of sentinel-node-diagnosis, which is right now being clinically evaluated, may be applied is colorectal surgical oncology."}

Although no serological tumor marker has yet been shown to be sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used in screening for colorectal, gastric, or pancreatic cancers, elevated pre-operative levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 correlate with advances stages of disease and a poorer clinical outcome. Monitoring of serum carcinoembryonic antigen after primary resection of colorectal cancer may identify a small percentage of asymptomatic patients with recurrent disease who are amenable to a second surgical procedure with curative intent. A new class of tumor markers that recognize cytokeratins, which comprise the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeletons of epithelial cells, is being evaluated as a prognostic factor in colorectal and gastric cancer. Elevated mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in tumor tissue compared with normal intestinal mucosa predicts for a poor prognosis after primary management of colorectal cancer. CA 19-9, CA 72-4, and CYFRA 21-1 may convey prognostic information in gastric cancer. CA 19-9 appears to be the best overall tumor marker for pancreatic cancer, and a subsequent rise after postoperative normalization may precede clinical detection of recurrent disease. CAM 17.1 is a new marker that has similar sensitivity but better specificity than CA 19-9 in pancreatic cancer. The utility of serial monitoring of these tumor markers in patients with advanced disease is less well established but may become helpful if more effective systemic therapy is developed."}

There is little information to indicate whether frequent visits to the doctor's office or frequent testing improves survival or quality of life. Ninety-eight patients with resected stage B2, B3 or C (modified Astler-Coller) colon cancer who developed recurrent disease while enrolled in prospective adjuvant trials at Mayo Clinic sponsored by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group were studied to evaluate the utility of follow-up tests to detect the first recurrence of colon cancer and the outcome following various interventions for these recurrences.

Bowel evaluation was done at 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter. In addition, a minority of patients had carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing, and radioisotope liver scans at various intervals. Symptoms signaled the diagnosis of recurrent disease in 55 patients, physical examination in 4 patients, and abnormalities in chest x-ray in 18 patients. An elevated CEA was the initial abnormal test in 5 patients, abnormal liver scans in 5 patients, elevated liver function tests in 6 patients and laparotomy for other reasons in 2 patients. Hemoglobin, barium enema, and fecal blood testing were useful in 1 patient each. Thirty-one percent of recurrences were diagnosed between scheduled visits. In our series, histories, physical examinations, and chest x-rays led to the detection of 79% of the recurrences while liver function tests, liver scans and CEAs led to the detection of 16% of recurrences. Sixteen patients underwent resection for cure for their first recurrence; the diagnosis of recurrence was signaled by symptoms in 6 patients, chest x-ray in 6 patients and abnormal liver function tests, CEA, hemoglobin, and laparotomy for colostomy closure in 1 patient each. The majority of tumor recurrences were detected by symptoms, physical examinations and chest x-rays. Testing for asymptomatic tumor recurrences during the 1st follow-up year is likely to be much less fruitful for detecting resectable recurrences than testing patients in the 2nd through 4th follow-up years. Patients who had a disease recurrence in the 1st postoperative year were less likely to be candidates for curative intent surgery. Lower tumor grade at initial diagnosis correlated both with likelihood of undergoing secondary surgical resection and the chance of doing well following this. These data may be helpful for defining more appropriate follow-up test for detection of tumor recurrence in patients with resected colon cancer."}

We analyzed a large cohort of node-negative colon cancer patients from a single institution to determine prognostic factors that predict which patients with node-negative colon cancer might experience recurrence and can benefit from postoperative chemotherapy. A review of the prospective database for colorectal cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between 1985 and 1993 identified 572 patients who underwent curative resection for node-negative colon cancer (T(1,2,3,4)N0M0). Demographic, serum, and pathologic factors were analyzed for prognostic significance. Survival was calculated by the method of Kaplan-Meier and compared by log rank test. Multivariate analysis was calculated by the Cox proportional hazard model. Median follow-up was 35 months. Factors predictive of survival by univariate analysis include tumor stage, overall stage, and preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) elevation. By multivariate analysis, overall stage and preoperative serum CEA level predicted survival. Routine histologic and demographic factors do not predict outcome in node-negative colon cancer patients. Preoperative CEA and overall stage predict survival by multivariate analysis. Preoperative CEA elevation in node-negative patients identifies a group of patients that has a poor prognosis and defines a subset of patients who may benefit from postoperative chemotherapy."}

Lesion-based sensitivity of IS was 94%, diagnostic accuracy 92%, both being unrelated to the CEA-serum level. When CT and IS were concordant regarding resectability, this estimate was correct in all instances. But in case of discordance the results of IS were verified operatively in 88% of cases. In no patient was there measurable immune reaction with formation of human-mouse-antibodies (HAMA). These results indicate that IS together with SPECT can achieve reliable and sensitive localisation of tumour lesions.

The assessment of both the serum CA19-9 and the serum CEA concentration is important in the clinical management of patients with colorectal cancer."}

Detection of p53 antibodies in serum might be an effective indirect procedure to detect alterations of the p53 gene. To assess the prevalence and the variation under treatment of p53 antibodies in patients with colorectal cancer. Fifty four patients with colorectal cancer (26 men and 28 women, mean age 65, range 33-90 years) and 24 patients with non-malignant digestive disease were tested for p53 antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and for the carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19.9. Immunohistochemical detection of p53 protein tumour overexpression was performed in 38 cases. Fourteen patients (26%) with colorectal cancer but none of those with non-malignant disease displayed p53 antibodies. Overexpression of p53 was shown by immunohistochemistry in 22 patients (58%), 10 of whom also had p53 antibodies. The antibodies were present in four patients with high carcinoembryonic antigen and three patients with high carbohydrate antigen 19.9 concentrations, but also in 10 patients (33.3%) with normal values of these markers. The ratio of p53 antibodies decreased in 11 of 13 patients after tumour resection. In two patients variations in p53 ratio strongly correlated with tumour relapse or progression. Testing for serum p53 antibodies constitutes a useful technique for assessing alterations in p53 and may help physicians to follow up patients with colorectal cancer."}

The use of a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies in intraoperative radioimmunodetection of colorectal tumour has been evaluated in 14 patients. Eight patients had primary and six recurrent colorectal cancer. Three different monoclonal antibodies were used included B72.3, recognizing TAG72 antigen, FO23C3 and FO23C5 directed against two epitopes of CEA. The antibodies were labeled with 125I. During surgery the radioactive emission of tumour and normal tissue was evaluated by a gamma detecting probe. Ten patients showed positive intraoperative results and in particular 6 (75%) of the 8 patients with primary tumour and 4 (67%) of the 6 patients with recurrence, with a mean tumour to normal tissue ratio of 2.2. Intraoperative radioimmunodetection was instrumental in modifying the therapeutic approach in two patients with recurrent cancer but in none of the patients with a primary presentation. Immunohistochemical analysis, to evaluate TAG72 and CEA antigen expression, was performed in 13 cases. CEA antigen was expressed in 8/13 cases and TAG72 in 5/13. Thus the sensitivity was 38.5% and 61.5% with B72.3 and anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies respectively, while in combination the sensitivity was 71.4%. The use of a cocktail of different antibodies improved the sensitivity of intraoperative radioimmunodetection of colorectal tumours, when compared with a single antibody injection. This approach might improve the clinical use of radioimmunodetection."}

Eighteen patients were evaluated for possible local recurrence of rectal carcinoma following abdominoperineal resection. The clinical presentation included rising carcinoembryonic antigen levels (n = 5), increasing size of a presacral mass on computed tomography or magnetic resonance (n = 13), or local symptoms (n = 3). Axial PET images of the pelvis were obtained following an injection of 10 mCi of FDG prior to biopsy. Quantitative analysis was performed by calculation of a standardized uptake ratio (SUR), and the images were interpreted by two radiologists in consensus. FDG-PET findings were correlated with histological or cytological findings and with the clinical outcome. Recurrent malignancy was confirmed in 13 patients by surgery (n = 8) or percutaneous biopsy (n = 5). Benign lesions were confirmed in five patients by surgery (n = 1), biopsy (n = 3), or clinical follow up (n = 1).

Pelvic recurrence is a significant problem following curative resection for rectal cancer. Although treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or any combination of these, the role of surgery remains controversial in management of these patients. In this study, we have attempted to define the patient with pelvic recurrence following curative rectal surgery who may benefit from reresection. A review of the prospective colorectal database at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between 1983 and 1991 identified 25 patients who had pelvic recurrence following a curative resection for rectal cancer and 52 patients who had their initial rectal surgery at an outside institution (OI) and their pelvic recurrence treated at MSKCC. Survival was calculated from time of recurrence by the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival comparisons were made by log-rank analysis. There were no differences between the two groups related to age, gender, type of initial surgery, stage, or use of adjuvant therapy. For the MSKCC group, median time to initial recurrence was 18 months, and median survival was 40 months. Recurrence was symptomatic in 17 patients and asymptomatic in 8 patients. Pain and bleeding accounted for more than one-half of symptomatic recurrences. Of the 17 symptomatic recurrences, 11 (65 percent) had relief of preoperative symptoms. There were no clinical or pathologic factors identified of the primary tumor or recurrence that predicted improved survival following salvage therapy. It was not possible to preoperatively determine which patients could undergo curative reresection. For the OI group, median time to recurrence was 13.7 months, and median survival from time of initial recurrence was 31 months. Curative reresection was the only factor that predicted for improved survival compared with noncurative treatment (P = 0.02). A comparison of the two groups revealed that pelvic recurrence was more likely to be reresected for cure in the OI group vs. the MSKCC group (34/51 vs. 9/25; P < 0.02). There was no survival difference between the two groups when comparing curative with noncurative management of these patients. Symptoms from recurrent rectal cancer can be palliated with surgery. The only patients who had a survival benefit were those patients in the OI group whose disease could be completely resected. These differences in reresection rates may be attributable to the presence or absence of available planes for dissection around the recurrence in the OI group, as determined by the method of initial curative resection."}

Cellular proliferative activity is a useful indicator of biologic aggressiveness in colorectal carcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) has important advantages of maintaining tissue architecture and technical simplicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between proliferative activity and malignancy potential in colorectal carcinomas to determine whether proliferative index of cancer cells has prognostic significance using immunohistochemical technique. Proliferation index at the invasive tumor margin of 86 paraffin sections of advanced colorectal carcinomas was assessed by immunohistochemical study using a mouse monoclonal antibody to PCNA (PC-10) and was compared with conventional clinicopathologic factors and other possible prognostic parameters, including p53 overexpression, tissue carcinoembryonic antigen immunoreactivity pattern, and flow cytometric DNA ploidy. In addition, recurrence and survival were analyzed in accordance with degree of PCNA expression. PCNA labeling index (PCNA-LI) increased significantly as the Astler-Coller stage advanced (P = 0.0001). Strong correlations were observed between PCNA-LI and various pathologic parameters, including histologic differentiation (P = 0.0027), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.0001), vascular invasion (P = 0.0001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0001), and liver metastasis (P = 0.0036). Mean PCNA-LI was also significantly higher in tumors with DNA aneuploidy (P = 0.0006) and negative and cytoplasmic patterns of carcinoembryonic antigen immunoreactivity (P = 0.01). Linear relationships were demonstrated between PCNA-LI and clinical outcomes; recurrence rate was significantly greater in the group with higher than the mean PCNA-LI, who underwent curative resection (P < 0.01), and four-year survival rates for both overall and curative cases with higher than the mean PCNA-LI were significantly poorer than those with lower than mean PCNA-LI (P < 0.005 and P < 0.01, respectively). Evaluation of PCNA-LI at the invasive tumor margin in colorectal carcinomas is suggested to be valuable in predicting those people with a higher potential for metastasis and recurrence after surgery; thus, the evaluation is helpful in planning reasonable adjuvant therapy, even in the earlier stages."}

Ninety-four patients who underwent curative surgery were enrolled and 24 patients (25.5%) had recurrence during the follow-up period (median: 30 months, range: 2-69 months). T1/2 of CEA for all patients ranged from 1.2 days to 88.1 days, with a median of 4.4 days. T1/2 of CEA (mean +/- standard deviation) was 11.7 +/- 17.9 days in recurrent patients, whereas it was 6.2 +/- 4.9 days in patients without recurrence (p = 0.0224). The patients' age, gender, size of the tumor, location of the tumor, pre-, and postoperative CEA level, pathologic type of the tumor and Dukes stage had no significance in recurrence. The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 95.1%, 81.1%, and 73.8% in patients with postoperative CEA levels less than 5 ng/ml (n = 62), respectively, and 71.4%, 64.8%, and 64.8% in patients with postoperative CEA levels higher than or equal to 5 ng/ml (n = 32), respectively (p = 0.04).

In conclusion, the disease-free survival of colorectal cancer patients was prolonged in patients who had a short T1/2 of CEA or a low level of postoperative CEA. In high-risk colorectal cancer patients with an abnormally high level of preoperative CEA, recurrence may be predicted by checking an early postoperative CEA level and/or by a simple calculation of the actual half life of CEA."}

The early diagnosis of rectum cancer recurrence is the first step towards the favourable issue of treatment. Surgical treatment of loco-regional recurrences of rectum cancer can be curative when it is possible to perform a total resection of the recurrences and of the infiltrated structures, without microscopic residuals of disease, or palliative, aiming to reset the intestinal and urinary functions or to reduce pain. At the Department of Surgery of the University of Perugia, from January 1984 to December 1983, 153 patients with rectal cancer-79 males (52%) and 74 females (48%)-were treated.

A total of 32 patients who had undergone resection for colorectal carcinoma were followed for a median period of 24 months (range, 6-36 months). Every 3 months, laminin, PIP, and PIIIP were measured in the sera together with the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). Twenty-one patients (Group 1) had no signs of recurrence, whereas the remaining 11 (Group 2) developed hepatic (n = 7) or pulmonary (n = 4) metastases. No variations were observed in either group for laminin, CEA, CA 19-9, or TPA, whereas significant increases in PIP and PIIIP were observed in both groups 3 months after surgery. The increase in PIP and PIIIP at the 3-month follow-up was significantly greater in Group 1 than in Group 2. The difference between values at 3 months and basal values enabled a discrimination between Group 1 and Group 2, with a sensitivity of 36% and 91% and a specificity of 71% and 71% for PIP and PIIIP, respectively.

The quantitative analyses of the CEA DT as related to various host and tumor characteristics, modes of recurrence, and life expectancy. The mean CEA DTs for gastric and colorectal carcinomas were 229 days and 86 days, respectively. Although there were no significant differences with regard to patient age, tumor size, gross appearance, and histological differentiation, women had shorter CEA DT than did men. Flow cytometric analysis showed that tumors with a higher proportion of cells in S phase (> or = 15%) had significantly shorter CEA DT than those with a lower S-phase fraction (< 15%). There was a significant correlation between the CEA DT and the length of survival after the initial CEA concentration increase in patients with recurrent gastric and colorectal carcinomas. In the multiple regression analysis of patients who had been treated with curative surgery and chemotherapy, CEA DT proved to be a major independent prognostic factor. Carcinoembryonic antigen DT predicts life expectancy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract.

Recurrence in the liver following hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma is a predictable phenomenon, occurring in about two-thirds of patients who develop recurrence. There are few data, however, about the value of repeated hepatic resection in patients who have a recurrence in the liver following initial resection of their hepatic metastases. We have reviewed our experience with 10 patients (of whom 9 were evaluable), culled from a series of 74 patients who had an initial hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. There were seven men and two women, mean age 52 (range 34-75 years). Duke's stages of the primary cancer were B1 in two patients, B2 in one patient, and C2 in six patients. Most of the patients had elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and constitutional symptoms as indications for the second-look procedure. There was one surgical death due to hepatic failure in a patient who required a trisegmentectomy. The average interval between the first and second hepatic resections was 21 months. The estimated 1- and 5-year actuarial survivals from the second liver resection were 78% and 23%, respectively. The median survival was 41 months from the first resection (range 14-100 months) and 16 months from the second resection (range 0-92 months).

Safer techniques of hepatic resection have allowed surgeons to consider repeat hepatectomy for colorectal metastases in an increasing number of patients. However, higher operative bleeding and increased morbidity have been reported after repeat hepatectomies, and the long-term benefit of these procedures needs to be evaluated. Sixty-four patients from a group of 243 patients resected for colorectal liver metastases were submitted to 83 repeat hepatectomies (64 second, 15 third, and 4 fourth hepatectomies). Combined extrahepatic surgery was performed in 21 (25%) of these 83 repeat hepatectomies. There was no intraoperative or postoperative mortality. Operative bleeding was not significantly increased in repeat hepatectomies as compared to first resections. Morbidity and duration of hospital stay were comparable to first hepatectomies. Overall and disease-free survival after a second hepatectomy were 60% and 42%, respectively, at 3 years and 41% and 26%, respectively, at 5 years. Factors of prognostic value on univariate analysis included the curative nature of first and second hepatectomies (p = 0.04 and p = 0.002, respectively), an interval between the two procedures of more than 1 year (p = 0.003), the number of recurrent tumors (p = 0.002), serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (p = 0.03), and the presence of extrahepatic disease (p = 0.03). Only the curative nature of the second hepatectomy and an interval of more than 1 year between the two procedures were independently related to survival on multivariate analysis. Repeat hepatectomies can provide long-term survival rates similar to those of first hepatectomies, with no mortality and comparable morbidity. Combined extrahepatic surgery can be required to achieve tumor eradication. Repeat hepatectomies appear worthwhile when potentially curative."}

In the univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with decreased crude survival: Presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p = 0.0001), poor grading of the primary tumor (p = 0.008), synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p = 0.004), satellite metastases (p < 0.0001), an increasing metastasis diameter (p < 0.0001), preoperative CEA elevation (p = 0.0002), a resection margin of less than 1 cm (p = 0.018), extrahepatic disease (p = 0.02), non-anatomical procedures (p = 0.008), and an operative blood loss exceeding 2.000 ml (p = 0.02).

Multiplicity and bilobar involvement did not affect prognosis. Similarly, no significant predictive value of an increasing number of metastases (1-3 vs > or = 4) on either overall (p = 0.35) or disease free survival (p = 0.55) was found after a radical excision of all detectable disease. Using Cox's multivariate regression analysis, presence of satellite metastases, anatomical vs non-anatomical approach, primary tumor grade and diameter of the largest metastasis all independently affected both crude and tumor-free survival (p < 0.05). With respect to survival, this was complemented by the margin of clearance (0.05 < p < 0.1), while for disease-free survival primary tumor site and time of metastasis diagnosis had some additional influence. Twenty-six patients with R0-reresection of the liver, and 32 patients with radical excision of extrahepatic recurrent disease had a subsequent 5-year survival of 57 +/- 15 percent and 32 +/- 12 percent, respectively. This confirms the effectiveness of a close follow-up policy."}

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network. In summary, the committee believes that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the management of the patient with colorectal cancer. The committee endorses the concept that treatment of patients on a clinical trial has priority over standard or accepted therapy. The recommended surgical procedure for managing resectable colon cancer is an en bloc resection; laparoscopic surgery should be done only in the context of a clinical trial. For patients with stage III disease, 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended. A patient who has metastatic disease in the liver or lung should be considered for surgical resection if he or she is a candidate for surgery and if surgery can extend survival. The committee advocates a conservative post-treatment surveillance program for colon and rectal cancer patients. A determination of CEA should be done only if CEA was elevated at baseline and decreased following primary resection. Abdominal and pelvic CT scans should be utilized only when there are clinical indications of possible recurrence. Patients whose disease progresses during 5-FU-based therapy should be considered for treatment with irinotecan or encouraged to participate in a phase I or II clinical trial."}

The monoclonal anti-CEA antibody, A5B7, has previously been administered to patients for radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Long circulation time and the formation of an immune response have limited therapeutic success in the clinic. Antibody fragments can be used to reduce the in vivo circulation time, but the best combination of fragment and radioisotope to use for therapy is far from clear. In this study we have compared the biodistribution of A5B7 IgG and F(ab')2 with chemically cross-linked divalent (DFM) and trivalent (TFM) A5B7 Fab' fragments in nude mice bearing human colorectal tumour xenografts. The cross-linkers were designed to allow site-specific labelling using yttrium 90 (90Y), a high-energy beta-emitter. We have also compared the above antibody forms conjugated to both 131I and 90Y. Both DFM and TFM were fully immunoreactive and remained intact after radiolabelling and incubation in serum at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Biodistribution results showed similar tumour uptake levels and an identical blood clearance pattern for F(ab')2 and DFM with high tumour-blood ratios generated in each case. However, unacceptably high kidney accumulation for both F(ab')2 and DFM and elevated splenic uptake of DFM labelled with 90Y was observed. Kinetic analysis of antigen binding revealed that DFM had the fastest association rate (kass = 1.6 x 10(5) Ms-1) of the antibody forms, perhaps owing to increased flexibility of the cross-linker. This advantage implies that DFM may be more suitable than F(ab')2 radiolabelled with 131I for RIT. TFM cleared from the blood significantly faster than A5B7 IgG when labelled with both 131I and 90Y, producing an improved therapeutic tumour-blood ratio. Kidney accumulation was not observed for [90Y]TFM, but a slightly higher splenic uptake was observed that may indicate reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake. Overall, tumour uptake was higher for 90Y-labelled antibodies than for 131I-labelled antibodies. Because of the faster clearance, it should be possible to administer a higher total dose of 90Y-labelled TFM than IgG, which is attractive for RIT. Both A5B7 DFM and TFM, therefore, show favourable properties compared with their parent antibody forms."}

Toxicity studies were carried out on guinea pigs and Swiss mice injected with a dose proportionally 100 times greater than that used in human studies. Clinical studies were performed in patients with clinically and/or biologically suspected adenocarcinoma recurrences. No immunoconjugate-induced toxicity was found. The biodistribution studies in mice gave better visualization of tumour sites with 111In-F6-SCN and 111In-F6-4-ICE than with 111In-F6-DTPA. Ten patients were included in the clinical protocol. 111In-F6-SCN and 111In-F6-4-ICE effectively visualized adenocarcinoma recurrences. However, in this small series, 111In-F6-4-ICE performed somewhat better than 111In-F6-SCN.

The authors evaluate the effectiveness of routine colonoscopy and marker evaluation in diagnosis of intraluminal recurrent cancer. Chart review was conducted on 481 patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer between 1980 and 1990. Clinical visits were scheduled and carcinoembryonic antigen evaluation was performed every three months, and colonoscopy was performed preoperatively, 12 to 15 months after surgical treatment, and then with intervals of 12 to 24 months or when symptoms appeared. About 10 percent of patients developed intraluminal recurrences. More than one-half of metachronous lesions arose within the first 24 months, and median time to diagnosis was 25 months. Patients with left-sited tumors in the advanced stage had a higher risk of developing recurrent intraluminal disease. Twenty-nine patients underwent a second surgical operation, of which 17 cases were radical. In this group, the five-year survival was 70.6 percent, although no nonradically treated or nonresected patients survived longer than 31 months. Twenty-two patients were asymptomatic at time of diagnosis of recurrence, and of these, 12 patients underwent radical operation; on the other hand, of the 24 symptomatic patients, only 5 were treated radically. Carcinoembryonic antigen was the first sign of recurrence in eight cases. Colonoscopy must be performed within the first 12 to 15 months after operation, whereas an interval of 24 months between examinations seems sufficient to guarantee early detection of metachronous lesions. Serial tumor marker evaluation is of help in earlier diagnosis of local recurrences. Asymptomatic patients more frequently undergo another operation for cure and thus have a better survival rate."}

The main rationale for follow-up of colorectal cancer patients resected for \"cure\" is that early detection and treatment of recurrence and metachronous disease should result in improved survival. Our purpose was to assess in a prospective fashion the impact on survival of a follow-up program versus that of undergoing nonscheduled visits. Within the 14-year period from 1975 through 1988, a prospective study was carried out on 800 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma radically resected with no evidence of synchronous cancers of the colon and rectum or in other organs, of whom 322 patients were to attend a 5-year follow-up, and 478 patients were free to make nonscheduled visits on account of symptoms. Asymptomatic recurrence was found at follow-up in 92 (28%) of 322 patients, whereas 175 (36%) of 478 patients had a symptomatic recurrence detected at a nonscheduled visit. Diagnosis of resectable recurrence was established within a median time of 21.5 months. Surgical resection of recurrence was performed in 30 (32%) of 92 and in 13 (7%) of 175 patients (32 vs. 7%; p < 0.001). Resection was curative in 13 (14%) of 92 and in two (1%) of 175. Five-year survival of resected recurrence was 10% in 30 of 92 patients and 0.8% in 13 of 175 (10 vs. 0.8%; p < 0.01). Two patients are alive with no evidence of disease or two (2%) of 92. Metachronous colorectal lesions were treated for cure in 63 (19.5%) of 322 patients. The effectiveness of scheduled follow-up was 4% (13 of 322 patients).

From January 01, 1985 to December 31, 1993 515 patients with primary rectal cancer underwent operative treatment at the hospital of general and abdominal surgery of the university of Mainz. In 294 patients with conventional surgical treatment and R0-resection of the tumor we investigated the influence of tumor-, patient- and therapeutic factors on local tumor recurrence. At a univariate analysis the following factors were significant: UICC-staging (p = 0.001), pT-classification (p = 0.001), pN-classification (p = 0.013) and localisation of the tumor (p = 0.013). These results could be verified for the pT-classification and pN-classification in a multivariate analysis. The significant influence of operative treatment (p = 0.034), blood transfusion (p = 0.018) and preoperative raised CEA (p = 0.026) depended on significant differences of UICC - staging and tumor - localisation of the different groups. Grading, sex and age had no influence. Inspite of a shift of local resurrence from 13% to 50% (0% to 42.9% for resections, respectively 6.7% to 55.4% for exstirpations) we could not find a significant influence of the surgeon. This fact depended on the dividing of a small number of cases on a lot of surgeons. In our opinion the influence of the surgeon or of different hospitals on local recurrence should be investigated in further studies."}

The Radioimmunoguided Surgery (RIGS) system was developed, in part, to detect occult tumor in patients with recurrent colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, however, patients are sometimes found to have unresectable peritoneal metastasis. For these patients, intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion (IPHP) with mitomycin C (MMC) was used as a novel treatment method. Thirty-six intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusions with MMC were given over the course of several studies. A preliminary study delineated two groups as possible candidates for this treatment: patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei and patients with peritoneal metastasis < 0.5 cm. Intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion (IPHP) was conducted for 1 hour after achieving an abdominal temperature of 41 degrees C. A dose of 30 mg MMC in 31 Plasmalyte was injected followed by a second 30 mg dose given at 30 minutes. Plasma pharmacokinetics of IPHP with MMC indicate an advantage in the range of 100-fold enhancement of exposure compared with delivery in plasma. The method was found to be safe when flow was observed and dosage decisions were made during perfusion according to flow. A clinical study group consisting of 15 patients underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by IPHP. The majority of them had either gastrointestinal or urologic anastomoses. There were no complications. In every patient the CEA level decreased after surgery and IPHP, with a median response of 6 months. RIGS technology aided in the selection of IPHP as a treatment choice by demonstrating the presence of an occult tumor burden in those patients whose traditional explorations were deceiving. This chapter includes technical details and suggestions for improving and modifying the use of IPHP."}

We evaluated 24 patients prospectively who had rising serum CEA 6-19 months after initial surgery for colorectal carcinoma. Ten patients had lesions confirmed by computed tomography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic examination or barium enema. Fourteen patients had negative findings on one or more of the above studies, but were suspected of having occult disease from their rising serum CEA. All patients were scheduled for surgery for restaging during a \"second look' procedure. Planar and single photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging was performed in all patients. All scintigraphic findings were correlated with surgical and histopathological results. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 81, 90 and 86% respectively when analysed by lesion, and 95, 60 and 88% respectively when analysed by patient. Ten of 14 (71%) patients with occult disease were correctly diagnosed as having recurrent disease. The SPET images were shown to have superior detectability (80%) compared with the planar images (35%). The surgeon judged the study to have had a neutral impact in 75% of the patients, but to have been helpful in 25%. We conclude that this antibody is potentially useful in detecting recurrent colorectal carcinoma in patients with rising serum CEA, especially when conventional imaging is negative or equivocal. It can also be helpful in altering planned surgery."}

Factors relating to operative technique.", "content": "Local and regional recurrence of carcinoma of the colon and rectum: II. Factors relating to operative technique. Despite many recent advances in the field of radiation therapy, chemotherapy and even immunotherapy, surgical resection remains the mainstay of curative treatment for carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Locoregional recurrence is a recognized type of failure, and it is the most direct measurement of the relevance of surgery to cancer control. Factors that influence relapse rates and sites deserve in-depth and periodical review. Local or locoregional (LR) recurrence implies the reappearance of carcinoma after an intended complete removal of the tumour. It is usually defined as tumour regrowth at the anastomosis or immediately within or contiguous to the operative area. For rectal cancer, the adjacent organs include the perineum, bladder and vagina; and LR failure includes perineal or pelvic lesions. Many reports studied only patients with colon or rectal cancers, while others presented their data of the colon and rectum together. In this review, I shall use colon, rectum and colorectum to designate the composition of each patient population. Published results from all available English sources were reviewed, concentrating on reports of the last 10 years. Data analysed by statistical methods are emphasized, and a probability of occurrence of one in 20 or less (P < 0.05) is considered significant. Various clinicopathological factors of the tumour and host, and adjuvant radiotherapy that affected the LR recurrence rates have been presented in another paper (part 1, 283 - 293). Technical details and issues relating to performance of the operation will be discussed in this paper (part II). Quantitative information presented here predate the wide use of laparoscopic or minimal invasive surgery in treating the primary tumour, and the polar practice of periodic colonoscopy, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or computed tomography as regular follow-up tests. Thus, these baseline data will be useful to study the changes in rates and sites of recurrence in the future."}
{"id": "8831736", "title": "[Diagnosis and therapy for metastatic liver cancer].", "content": "[Diagnosis and therapy for metastatic liver cancer]. Hepatic metastases occur frequently in patients with colorectal cancer. Patients with advanced cancer should be followed carefully after curative resection of the primary lesions for the early detection of the recurrence. If hepatic metastasis is suspected on the basis of rising CEA levels, more sophisticated imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and hepatic angiography should be employed for the diagnosis. However, these tests are not cost-effective and not warranted on a routine follow-up basis. To be more cost-effective, a relatively simple and sensitive test or group of tests should be used. The authors have proposed that the basement membrane producibility of the primary lesion yields the most important information predicting a liver metastasis; the basement membrane producing cancer highly metastasizes to the liver. In contrast, more than 90% of non-producing cancer does not metastasize to the liver. The basement membrane producibility is easily examined by laminin staining. In the treatment of hepatic metastases, hepatic resection is the preferred approach when the metastases are located in a resectable segment or can be encompassed by as many as five wedge resections, but these scenarios are relatively uncommon. For unresectable disease, chemotherapy and intravenous and/or intra-arterial embolization are viable alternatives. Loco-regional treatment may offer a pharmacological advantage since a liver metastasis is almost exclusively fed by the hepatic artery. A pilot study we conducted on hepatic infusion chemotherapy combined with interleukin-2 (IL-2.MF) revealed very encouraging results (response rate: 76%), and further study in a prospective randomized trial confirmed this high response rate. Adjuvant IL-2.MF infusion therapy after curative resection of liver metastases is also effective for the prevention of recurrence in the residual liver. Based on the data, we conclude that multimodal treatments of hepatic resection and loco-regional infusion of immuno-chemotherapy (IL-2.MF) make it possible to control both resectable and unresectable liver metastases."}

Liver metastasis from colorectal carcinoma is an important problem in surgical treatment and profoundly affects the prognosis of patients. If it were possible to identify characteristic features in the primary lesion strongly related to liver metastasis, these could be used as prognostic markers for liver metastasis. To search for such features, the primary lesions of patients with colorectal carcinoma with liver metastasis were investigated. Three groups of colorectal carcinoma were examined: Group A with synchronous liver metastases; Group B with only lymph node metastases without recurrence for 5 years; and Group C with recurrence of liver metastases. Groups A and B included 24 cases and Group C, 20. We focused on cancer cell morphology at the invasive front and expression of sialyl Lewis X (sialyl Lex) in the primary cancer. At the invasive front in Group A it was frequently found that polygonal, not columnar, cancer cells with a single or solitary trabecular form with indistinct polarity, showed an infiltrative growth pattern. This type of morphology was termed \"focal dedifferentiation\" and graded four levels. Eleven of 24 cases (46%) had severe focal dedifferentiation in Group A, 1 of 24 (4%) in Group B, and 6 of 20 (30%) in Group C. Sialyl Lex staining was positive in 12 of 24 cases (50%) in Group A, in 3 of 24 cases (13%) in Group B, and in 7 of 20 cases (35%) in Group C in the primary carcinoma. In respect to the staining of (sialyl Lex) at focal dedifferentiation, it was positive in 17 of 24 cases (71%) in Group A, in 4 of 24 cases (17%) in Group B and in 11 of 20 cases (55%) in Group C. Focal dedifferentiation and sialyl Lex staining in the primary cancer showed a significant difference between Groups A and B. Sialyl Lex staining at focal dedifferentiation showed a significant difference between Groups A and B and Groups B and C. Other adhesion related molecules, sialyl LeA and CEA, showed no difference among Groups A, B, and C. Both focal dedifferentiation and expression of sialyl Lex antigen in the primary lesion are considered good markers for assessing the metastatic proclivity of colorectal cancer."}

None of the 12 patients with biliary CEA concentrations within the reference range has developed recurrent tumour. Biliary CEA concentrations do not predict the presence of occult liver metastases if bile samples are taken during resection of the primary tumour.

An immunocytochemical study of patients with stomach or colorectal carcinoma]. The tumor spread and the radicality of surgical resection are the most important facts in a patient's prognosis. In spite of curative tumor resection many patients die from metastases or local tumor recurrence. One possible reason is early dissemination of tumor cells which cannot be detected with clinical methods of examination. For this reason the aim of our study was to examine both bone marrow and peritoneal lavage for disseminated tumor cells with an immunocytochemical technique in patients with a gastrointestinal carcinoma. We also wanted to find out whether there was any correlation between the incidence of tumor cell detection and the TNM classification, staging and tumor grading and whether disseminated tumor cells have any prognostic significance. Our study included 54 patients who underwent surgery in our clinic for a carcinoma of the stomach (20 patients) or the colorectum (34 patients) from November 1993 to December 1994. At the beginning of the operation bone marrow had been taken from the iliac spine, and the abdomen was irrigated with 1000 ml saline solution immediately after laparotomy or laparoscopy. After cell separation with Ficoll density centrifugation 5 x 10(5) cells were applied per slide by a cytospin technique. For detection of the tumor cells we used the APAAP technique and the following monoclonal antibodies: KL1, CK2, anti-CEA, 17-1A (bone marrow) and Ber-EP4, B72.3, anti-CEA and 17-1A (peritoneal lavage). Altogether 77% of all patients had tumor cells in the bone marrow and 69% in peritoneal lavage fluid. It was possible to detect tumor cells in bone marrow (67%) and peritoneal lavage fluid (25%) even of patients with T1 tumors. The percentage increased with depth of wall infiltration. There was a marked difference in bone marrow aspirates between patients with lymph-node-negative tumors (N0) and those with lymph-node-positive tumors (N+): 65% had tumor cells in N0 and 85% in N+ stages. This trend was also seen in patients with (M1) and without (M0) metastases, in both bone marrow aspirates and peritoneal lavage fluid. In bone marrow there was a good correlation of tumor cells with staging, but in peritoneal lavage fluid this was not so. Finally, we detected tumor cells more often in bone marrow and peritoneal lavage fluid of patients with poorly differentiated tumors (G3) or diffuse Lauren type than in patients with moderately differentiated tumors (G2) or intestinal Lauren type. After a median follow-up period of 12.5 months patients with disseminated tumor cells had a lower survival rate than patients without tumor cells."}

The patient have been followed throughout the diagnostic period with various methods. It has been the will of the authors, who have presented their protocol of reference, to put under comparison the various controlling methods in order to visualize their reliability, specificity and the indication of each one of them. The CEA is the most sensible haemanalysis for lifting the doubt of recidivation. As for the TAC and ultrasound it has been reserved the job of formulating a correct diagnosis; the results of both diagnostics through imagery have been more or less the same. However, the ultrasound examination have shown more false positives than the TAC. The research of the blood occult in the stool is a rapid and economic detection in the case of intramural recidivations, even if we cannot disregard the share of false positives. A high specificity for the study of intramural recidivations has been offered by the endoscopic scan particularly when associated by a brushing and biopsy."}

The Immunomedics Study Group. To assess the performance and the potential clinical impact of a new antibody imaging agent, CEA-Scan (Immunomedics Inc, Morris Plains, NJ), in 210 presurgical patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic colorectal carcinomas. CEA-Scan, an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) Fab antibody fragment labeled with technetium-99m-pertechnetate (99mTc), was injected intravenously (IV), and external scintigraphy was performed 2 to 5 and 18 to 24 hours later. Imaging with conventional diagnostic modalities (CDM) was also performed, and findings were confirmed by surgery and histology. The sensitivity of CEA-Scan was superior to that of CDM in the extrahepatic abdomen (55% v 32%; P = .007) and pelvis (69% v 48%; P = .005), and CEA-Scan findings complemented those of CDM in the liver. Among 122 patients with known disease, the positive predictive value was significantly higher when both modalities were positive (98%) compared with each alone (68% to 70%), potentially obviating the need for histologic confirmation when both tests are positive. Imaging accuracy also was significantly improved by adding CEA-Scan to CDM. In 88 patients with occult cancer, imaging accuracy was enhanced significantly by CEA-Scan combined with CDM (61% v 33%). Potential clinical benefit from CEA-Scan was demonstrated in 89 of 210 patients. Only two patients developed human antimouse antibodies (HAMA) to CEA-Scan after a single injection, and none of 19 assessable patients after two injections. CEA-Scan affords high-quality, same-day imaging, uses an inexpensive and readily available radio-nuclide, adds clinically significant information in assessing extent and location of disease in colorectal cancer patients, and only rarely induces a HAMA response."}

Immunohistochemical studies showed that TAG-72 is expressed in more than 80% of colorectal carcinomas, but is rarely expressed in normal epithelium and benign diseases. TAG-72 can also be found in the body fluids of patients with adenocarcinomas, and its direct measurement can be used in conjunction with immunocytochemical analysis to help in discriminating benign from malignant effusions. The evaluation of TAG-72 in serum of colorectal carcinoma patients showed a sensitivity of approximately 40%, comparable to that of the widely used CEA. TAG-72 serum levels correlate with the stage of disease, suggesting its utility in discriminating between early-stage versus late-stage colon carcinoma. Longitudinal studies demonstrated that TAG-72 serum levels may be used as a predictive marker of recurrences. Moreover, the simultaneous measurement of TAG-72 and CEA serum markers improves the monitoring of recurrent disease. Therefore, these data suggest that TAG-72 is a well suitable marker for colorectal cancer."}

Our work was aimed at assessing the accuracy of CT and MRI in the early identification of postoperative recurrences of rectosigmoid cancer, quantifying false positive and false negative ratios and questionable findings. A homogeneous series of 50 patients submitted to surgery for primary rectosigmoid carcinoma was studied with both CT and MRI and followed-up for up to 2 years: local recurrences were observed in 15 patients (30%) which occurred within the first year of surgery in 67% of cases and were in extraluminal site in 86% of cases. CT appeared to be a reliable and highly sensitive screening method, with 82% sensitivity: only 2 false negatives were observed, which were nevertheless followed-up because CT had yielded questionable, and not negative, findings. In contrast, CT had only 78% specificity, being unable to differentiate fibrosis, displaced normal structures and recurrences in 7 cases; its positive predictive value (PPV) was 66%, with 89% negative predictive value (NPV) and 80% accuracy. MRI had a complementary role to CT, because of its capabilities in discriminating all the questionable CT cases and in identifying all CT false positives, thanks to its higher specificity (100%). MRI had 74% sensitivity, which was lower than that of CT; MRI yielded 2 false negatives which, however, had been previously diagnosed with CT. MRI had 100% PPV, 89% NPV and 92% accuracy. Therefore, for the early detection of rectal cancer recurrences, the following diagnostic protocol is suggested: CT should be performed first, as a screening method, within 2-4 months of surgery, and repeated every 6-8 months during the first 2 years-together with CEA values monitoring. MRI should be reserved to the patients in whom CT findings were positive, questionable, or in disagreement with clinical symptoms and/or with increasing CEA values. If MRI fails to solve the diagnostic doubt, a CT-guided biopsy of the mass should be performed."}

Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, a frequent neoplasia in industrialized countries, permits curative surgery. In this study we assessed the clinical role of serum tumor markers determination in diagnosing, staging, and grading colorectal cancer; the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) and CA 72-4 in colorectal cancer follow-up was also assessed. In 114 patients with colorectal cancer, the oncofetal antigen CEA was compared with the membrane-associated glycoproteins CA 19-9, CA 242, and CA 72-4 and with the cytokeratins TPA, tissue polypeptide-specific antigen (TPS) and tissue polypeptide monoclonal antigen (TPM). Overall, the most sensitive indices were TPA and TPS (67% and 70%, respectively). Tumor stage influenced the levels of CEA, CA 19-9, and TPA, but not those of TPS, while tumor grade influenced CEA and TPS, but not CA 72-4, TPA, and TPM. TPA was the most sensitive index in identifying early or well-differentiated colorectal cancers. The sensitivity was enhanced when this marker was determined in combination with CEA, in diagnosing both advanced and early colorectal tumors. Seventy-seven patients were followed up after therapy for at least 18 months. CEA was the most sensitive index of recurrence (58%); however, this sensitivity is too low to consider tumor markers useful in colorectal cancer follow-up."}

Serial serum samples were available for analysis in 67 patients with subsequent recurrence, of which 36 patients had been treated for colonic and 31 patients for rectal cancer. Liver metastases were found in 32 patients, local recurrences in 18 patients, lung metastases in 11 patients and other distant metastases in 6 patients. The same serum samples were used in quantitating the serum levels of both CA 242 and CEA. At the time of clinical recurrence an elevated CA 242 level was found in 41 patients and an elevated CEA level in 49 patients. Thirty-six patients (54%) showed an elevation of both CA 242 and CEA, five patients (7%) had increased CA 242 alone and 13 patients (19%) increased CEA alone. Altogether, 54 patients (81%) showed an elevation of either or both markers at the time of clinical recurrence. Initially CA 242 alone began to rise in 14 patients (21%) and CEA alone in 16 patients (24%). The lead time was calculated from 28 patients that had four or more serum samples available during follow-up. CA 242 increased in median 5,7 months and CEA in median 3,4 months before clinical recurrence (p=0.34). CA 242 was more sensitive for lung metastases (64%) than CEA (45%), whereas CEA was superior to CA 242 in liver metastases (88% versus 72%, respectively) and in local recurrences (56% versus 39%, respectively). Both CA 242 and CEA seem to be useful in early diagnosis of a recurrence in the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer."}

Technetium-99m labelled BW431/26, a monoclonal antibody against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), was used. The study included 73 patients (31 females and 42 males). Sixty-eight patients were suspected of having recurrent colorectal adenocarcinoma while another five were suspected to have primary colorectal cancer. Images were acquired at 10 min and 4 and 24 h following the injection of radioantibody. The efficacy of RIS in tumour detection was evaluated by the findings at surgery, histological investigation and/or other diagnostic modalities and clinical follow-up. Four of five patients with suspected primary colorectal cancer gave true-positive results (three at primary sites, one at the site of a metastatic lesion) while one was false-positive. The overall accuracy of RIS in the diagnosis of recurrent colorectal cancer was 87%. Its sensitivity in the detection of locoregional or abdominal recurrence and liver metastases was 97% and 89% respectively. RIS was more accurate than computed tomography (CT) scan in the detection of pelvic recurrence and liver metastases while CT scan was far superior to RIS in detecting lung metastases. RIS proved most useful in patents who had rising CEA levels on clinical follow-up but in whom other work-up, including CT scan, was negative. The advantages of RIS include the ability to detect tumour recurrence prior to other investigations and to identify tumour recurrence in areas such as the pelvis, where CT and magnetic resonance imaging have their greatest weaknesses in diagnosing recurrent disease. The imaging accuracy is significantly increased when combined CT and antibody imaging is performed."}

An analysis was performed to evaluate early patterns of recurrence and survival in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for primary colorectal cancer. Thirty-nine patients are available with a minimum of 24 months postoperative follow-up. The techniques and expected surgical outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopically assisted colectomies are slowly being defined as these procedures become more common and more widely available. One of the areas of greatest concern is the use of laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for the surgical treatment of patients with primary colorectal cancer. There are anecdotal reports in the literature describing both port site recurrence and wound recurrence in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for colorectal cancer. This raises concerns about whether these recurrences are more common in patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures and whether overall survival is compromised. Wound recurrences and laparoscopic port site recurrences have been described with numerous other intra-abdominal tumors, but the precise incidence remains unknown. The authors reviewed data from 39 patients to determine early patterns of recurrence and overall survival. Two-hundred thirty-eight laparoscopic-assisted colectomies were performed by the Norfolk Surgical Group between June 1992 and September 1995. Thirty-nine of the patients who underwent resection for colorectal cancer between June 1992 and September 1993 currently are available for at least a 2-year follow-up. Preoperative evaluation included physical examination, liver function studies, carcinoembryonic antigen, chest x-ray, computed tomography scans, and endoscopies with biopsy. Postoperative follow-up data consisted of physical examination, liver function tests, CEA, chest X-ray, computed tomography scan of the abdomen, and endoscopy of the colon. No patients have been lost to follow-up. Survival rates and patterns of recurrence were compared between node-negative and node-positive patients and compared with conventional data after open surgery. There were 22 men and 17 women ranging in age from 33 to 89 years. Mean follow-up was 30 months, with a range of 24 to 40 months. There were three patients with recurrence and nine deaths. Recurrence and tumor-related death rates, respectively, for each Dukes' stage were 0/1 and 0/1 for stage A, 0/7 and 0/7 for stage B-1, 1/16 and 2/16 for stage B-2, 0/1 and 0/1 for stage C-1, and 2/8 and 1/8 for Stage C-2. All six patients with Dukes' stage D disease died of metastatic colorectal cancer within 4 to 14 months of surgery. There were two patients with anastomotic recurrence. No unusual patterns of recurrent disease were noted, and there were no wound or port site recurrences. In this group of patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for primary colorectal malignancy, no adverse patterns of recurrence or decreased survival has been noted at 2-year follow-up when compared with standard open colorectal cancer surgery statistics. Prospective randomized studies with long-term follow-up will be required to better define the potential benefits and adverse effects of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal malignancy."}

The authors addressed whether a repeat hepatic operation is warranted in patients with recurrent isolated hepatic metastases. Are the results as good after second operation as after first hepatic operation? Five-year survival after initial hepatic operation for colorectal metastases is approximately 33%. Because available alternative methods of treatment provide inferior results, hepatic resection for isolated colorectal metastasis currently is well accepted as the best treatment option. However, the main cause of death after liver resection for colorectal metastasis is tumor recurrence. Records of 95 patients undergoing initial hepatic operation and 10 patients undergoing repeat operation for isolated hepatic metastases were reviewed for operative morbidity and mortality, survival, disease-free survival, and pattern of failure. The literature on repeat hepatic resection for colorectal metastases was reviewed. The mean interval between the initial colon operation and first hepatic resection was 14 months. The mean interval between the first and second hepatic operation was 17 months. Operative mortality was 0%. At a mean follow-up of 33 +/- 27 months, survival in these ten patients was 100% at 1 year and 88% +/- 12% at 2 years. Disease-free survival at 1 and 3 years was 60% +/- 16% and 45% +/- 17%, respectively. After second hepatic operation, recurrence has been identified in 60% of patients at a mean of 24 +/- 30 months (median 9 months). Two of these ten patients had a third hepatic resection. Survival and disease-free survival for the 10 patients compared favorably with the 95 patients who underwent initial hepatic resection. Repeat hepatic operation for recurrent colorectal metastasis to the liver yields comparable results to first hepatic operations in terms of operative mortality and morbidity, survival, disease-free survival, and pattern of recurrence. This work helps to establish that repeat hepatic operation is the most successful form of treatment for isolated recurrent colorectal metastases."}

In a blinded fashion, radiolabeled B72.3 was investigated in operative cases of recurrent colorectal cancer to determine if diagnostic accuracy would be improved to ultimately maximize curability and minimize interventional morbidities. Study patients underwent conventional evaluation including history, physical examination, abdominal/pelvic computed tomographic scan (CT), colon examination, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) determination, with select magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonographic imaging as indicated. Murine monoclonal antibody B72.3 was labeled with indium-111 (111In-CYT-103 provided by Cytogen) and scans obtained at 48 hours and, selectively, at 72 and 96 hours. Unlike previous studies, the operating surgeon was blinded to 111In-CYT-103 abdominal scan results until surgical exploration was complete. Of 15 study patients (10 male; 5 female), average age was 57 years, and average CEA was 10 ng/ml (with eight elevated CEA levels). A single patient did not undergo surgery because of presence of pulmonary metastases identified on CT scan but not identified on a 111In-CYT-103 scan. Laparotomies included resection and intraoperative radiation (10), resection alone (1), and biopsy only (3). CT and 111In-CYT-103 scans were compared with operative findings. CT scans had an accuracy and positive predictive value of 47 and 100 percent, respectively, whereas those of 111In-CYT-103 scan were 60 and 82 percent, respectively. Contribution of the scan to diagnosis and management was graded by the surgeon as no effect (67 percent), beneficial effect (13 percent), or negative effect (20 percent). 111In-CYT-103 was more accurate compared with CT scan, but when value of the scan was examined with respect to its potential contribution to patient management, it was beneficial in only 13 percent of patients.

Five-year survival rates after resection of liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma are close to 25%. Recurrences occur in two-thirds of the patients after surgery. Selection of patients likely to benefit from surgery remains controversial and subjective. Data from 1568 patients with resected liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma were collected. The prognostic value of different factors was studied through uni- and multivariate analyses. A scoring system was developed including the most relevant factors. Two- and 5-year survival rates were 64% and 28%, respectively, and were affected by: age; size of largest metastasis or CEA level; stage of the primary tumor; disease free interval; number of liver nodules; and resection margin. Giving one point to each factor, the population was divided into three risk groups three risk groups with different 2-year survival rates: 0-2 (79%), 3-4 (60%), 5-7 (43%). A simple prognostic scoring system was proposed to evaluate the chances for cure of patients after resection of liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma. The comparison between expected survival and estimated operative risk can help determine on an objective basis whether surgery is worthwhile. This system needs further prospective validation."}

The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of CEA and imaging techniques-directed SLO. Seven hundred fifty-six patients with Dukes Stages B and C, who had undergone curative resection, were monitored postoperatively using CEA and imaging techniques. An SLO was performed on any potentially resectable recurrence, and in addition, an SLO was done when a persistently rising CEA value was detected. Recurrence developed in 18.8 percent (142/756) of patients, and 90.8 percent (129/142) of the recurrences were detected within the first three years following curative resection. When comparing carcinomas of the colon with that of the rectum, the former were associated with significantly more hepatic and intraabdominal recurrences, whereas the latter had significantly more locoregional and pulmonary recurrences. Seventy-two patients underwent SLO. Of these patients, 54.2 percent (39/72) had all of their disease resected, and 1.4 percent (1/72) had no detectable disease at the SLO. Among the 142 patients with recurrence, 71 (50 percent) patients underwent SLO. The resectable group at SLO carried a significantly better survival than the unresectable recurrence group (41.3 vs. 5.2 percent; P<0.01).

Several serum tumor markers have been studied in different types of epithelial cell-associated cancer. The application of these markers in clinical oncologic practice is hampered by insufficient sensitivity and specificity in most primary tumors. It is important to define which markers contribute to patient management. Prostate-specific antigen can be used in prostate cancer patients for screening and monitoring advanced disease. Cancer antigen 125 is primarily used for the monitoring of combined chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients. In breast cancer patients preoperative levels of cancer antigen 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, and tissue polypeptide antigen specific do not contribute in prognosis, but changes in the levels of these markers predict the clinical outcome in the treatment of advanced disease better than UICC criteria. Carcinoembryonic antigen and tissue polypeptide antigen specific can detect recurrence in colorectal cancer patients earlier than imaging methods. Tissue polypeptide antigen specific is sensitive in measuring response to combined chemotherapy in advanced gastrointestinal cancer. In bladder cancer, urine levels of cytokeratins are sensitive in indicating advanced disease. In small-cell lung cancer neuron-specific enolase is a good indicator of chemotherapy response. In non-small-cell lung cancers, cytokeratins may also predict response in chemotherapy treatment. Clinical application of tumor markers in the correct circumstances can omit more invasive and costly procedures and will contribute to better patient care."}

This report is part of a prospective multicenter clinical trial initiated by the International Atomic Energy Agency to evaluate the role of this antibody in radioimmunoimaging of patients with suspected disease recurrence. A group of 31 consecutive patients underwent radioimmunoimaging with Tc-99m-BW 431/26 after resection of their primary CRC. Patient referral was based on either a persistent rise in serum CEA levels of unknown origin and/or questionable findings by other imaging studies. Whole-body planar scans and single photon emission computed tomography scans of selected body regions (e.g., chest, abdomen) were performed up to 24 hours after the intravenous antibody injection. Pathologic antibody concentration localizations by radioimmunoimaging were correlated with surgical, clinical, and other imaging modality findings to validate the accuracy of radioimmunoimaging in detecting CRC recurrence. A total of 75 detected tumoral lesions was evaluated: 26 of 75 were of known origin (36%), and 49 of 75 were of unknown origin (65%). There were four true-negative lesions, one false-negative lesion, and no false-positive lesions; all others were true-positive lesions. Sensitivity was 96.8%, specificity 100%, and accuracy 98.6%. The study was easy to perform, without untoward side effects on patients after antibody administration. Anti-CEA antibody radioimmunoimaging is a highly reliable diagnostic procedure in detecting CRC recurrence and is useful especially for the diagnosis of patients with rising CEA blood levels of unknown origin, thereby significantly affecting patient management. Radioimmunoimaging should become part of the diagnostic workup of patients suspected of having CRC recurrence."}

In seven European countries a multicenter trial with the 99mTc-labelled monoclonal anti-CEA antibody BW 431/26 was conducted in 730 patients. The antibody is used for the immunoscintigraphic visualisation of CEA-expressing tumours. Investigated were in particular colorectal tumours, bladder and breast carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of the lung and gastric carcinoma. The main area of use is the detection of recurrences and screening for foci in patients with rising serum CEA. The sensitivity amounts to at least 80% in case of primary colorectal tumours (n = 129) and their abdominal or pelvic metastases (n = 33) and to 90% for their recurrences (n = 107). HAMAs were detectable in less than 15% of patients investigated for the first time. In 17% of the patients examined, immunoscintigraphy was the only technique to visualize the lesion whereas all other diagnostic methods had failed. The procedure yielded additional information in 24-51% of cases."}

The optimal regimen to monitor for recurrences and new primary tumors remains unknown. The nationwide cost impact of wide practice variation is also unknown. The 1,070 members of The Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) were surveyed using a detailed questionnaire to measure the practice patterns of surgical experts nationwide. Respondents were asked how often they use nine separate methodologies in follow-up during years 1-5 postsurgery for TNM stage I, II, and III patients. Costs were estimated for representative less and more intensive strategies. Evaluable responses were received from 349 members (33%). Office visit and carcinoembryonic antigen analysis were performed most frequently. SSO members generally see patients every 3 months in years 1-2, every 6 months in years 3-4, and annually thereafter. There was wide variability in test ordering patterns and moderate variation between SSO and previously surveyed American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons members. The charge differential between representative less and more intensive follow-up strategies for each annual U.S. patient cohort is approximately $800 million. Actual practice patterns vary widely, indicating lack of consensus regarding optimal follow-up. The enormous cost differential associated with such variation is difficult to justify because there is no proven benefit of more intensive follow-up."}

This paper focuses on metastatic recurrences and their surgical treatment, comparing the outcome of resective therapy with the natural history of metastases. Results of alternative methods (alcoholization and trans-arterial chemo-embolization), are evaluated through the analysis of indications, complications and real benefit. Between January 1980 and Jan 1995, 163 patients with hepatic metastases were operated on in our Department. In 132 cases, metastases originated from colorectal cancer: 105 were submitted to hepatic resection, 3 were treated by selective ischemia, 5 by chemotherapy through an infusaid catheter, 5 by alcoholization under ultrasonographic control, 14 by a new phase II trial of schedule oriented biochemical modulation of FUra bolus by MTX and B interferon and FUra continuous infusion by leucovorin. Out of 76 metachronous metastases operated on, 10 were metastatic hepatic recurrences surgically treated by second resection. The average time-interval intercurring between the two hepatic resections was 15 months. The average follow-up and survival period after repeated resection was 27 months (range 2-129). Through the analysis of these ten cases, we sorted out the segmentary localization of hepatic metastases, the type of operation performed, the disease free interval, serum CEA patterns, morbidity and survival."}

We performed SPECT and MRT within 8 hours on the same day. Glucagon intravenously was used to reduce artefacts due to intestinal motility.

By means of a clinical example we present anatomic concordant superimposition and explain the findings and the clinical value of our technique. This system and technique are equally applicable to other digital imaging investigations. By IF, on the basis of the certain evidence of the tracer depot of a pathological lesion diagnosed by MRT and the reliability of the anatomical assignment of a focal lesion diagnosed by SPECT, early detection of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal cancer, the correct localisation of recurrent disease and its distinction from non-malignant tissue becomes possible.

To determine if pre-operative radiation therapy induces a local response in patients with complete tumour penetration into the rectal wall and allows for anal sphincter preservation, we compared the results from pathological specimens and local recurrences as measurable end-points in patients treated with pre-operative radiation therapy plus low anterior resection vs. those only treated with low anterior resection. From January 1986 to December 1992, we treated 62 patients with mid-rectal adenocarcinoma (5-10 cm from the anal verge as determined by rigid proctosigmoidoscopy with the patient in the jackknife position). Pre-operative evaluation included: complete blood cell count, chemistry profile and the determination of carcinoembryonic antigen, chest X-ray, barium enema or colonoscopy and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Only tumours potentially curative by resection in patients with performance status 0-2 (ECOG) were included. Twenty-one patients received pre-operative radiation therapy at a dose of 45 Gy delivered to the pelvis; 4-8 weeks later a low anterior resection was performed. Forty-one patients were treated with low anterior resection alone. Surgical specimens were classified according to the Astler-Coller modification of Dukes' classification. There were 36 males and 26 females, with a mean age of 56 years. The surgical specimens of those treated only with surgery were classified as: A, 5; B1, 4; B2, 15; C1, 2; and C2, 15. Postirradiated specimens: no residual tumour, 3; A, 4; B1, 4; B2, 7; C2, 3. One surgical death occurred in the group who underwent surgery alone. The median follow-up was 50 months in patients treated with surgery alone vs. 62 months in the combined approach group. Local recurrences occurred in 15/40 patients treated with surgery alone and in 2/21 of those treated with the combined approach (P = 0.043). Anal sphincter continence was classified as excellent by 24/40 patients treated with surgery only and by 18/21 patients treated with the combined approach. The 5-year survival period was 58% in the surgery only group and 82% in the group with combined treatment (P = 0.08). The use of pre-operative radiation therapy plus low anterior resection was associated with a lower rate of local recurrence and with a higher number of surgical specimens with no lymph node metastases. Thus, this combined treatment modality should be further evaluated as a possible treatment of mid-rectal cancers in good surgical candidates selected for sphincter-saving procedures."}

Serum CEA measurements have not been reported for patients with salivary gland carcinomas. Serum CEA was measured in a case study using enzyme immunoassay with monoclonal antibody specific for CEA. Tissue was examined with standard histologic and immunohistologic methods. A patient was initially seen with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the trachea and had a markedly elevated serum CEA level which declined after surgical resection. The serum CEA level became elevated again when the patient developed abdominal metastases and then declined after debulking of the tumor. Immunohistochemical study of the tumor was positive for CEA. The measurement of serum CEA levels may play a role in the management of patients with ACC. Clinical investigation utilizing monoclonal antibodies against CEA, for imaging and for the delivery of chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be worthwhile."}

Several studies focused on the potential clinical usefulness of CA 72-4 in gastrointestinal (GI) and gynecological cancer, showing a sensitivity of approximately 40% in colorectal and gastric cancer and 50% in ovarian cancer, with an overall specificity of more than 95%. Longitudinal evaluations of patients with either GI or gynecological malignant diseases demonstrated that significant elevations of CA 72-4 serum levels may be predictive of recurrent disease. Moreover, the combination of CA 72-4 with other known serum markers, such as CEA and CA 19-9 for GI cancer or CA 125 for ovarian cancer, indicated that an increase in the sensitivity can be achieved without substantial changes in the overall specificity, improving the possibility of monitoring these patients. In conclusion, these results provide a strong argument for the use of CA 72-4 in the management of these neoplastic diseases."}

The classical indications, limited to solitary lesions, have been extensively modified, and resection of bilateral lesions, recurrent lesions and pulmonary lesions in patients previously operated for other extrathoracic metastases is now possible. The 5-year survival rates vary between 20 and 44% in the various series. The complete nature of the resection is an essential prerequisite to prolonged survival. The other prognostic factors are discussed: presence of lymph node invasion or raised CEA appear to carry a poor prognosis. On the other hand, the type of resection performed, the disease-free interval, the repeated nature of the pulmonary resection and the presence of previously operated extrathoracic metastases do not appear to influence survival. Opinions differ concerning the prognostic significance of disseminated pulmonary lesions, particularly when complete resection is possible. These results confirm the special place of surgery in the treatment of lung metastases of colon and rectum cancers. The operative indications are still difficult to define, but the relatively benign nature of this surgery justifies an extension of the indications."}

A protocol with tumor markers as guidelines to follow up colorectal cancer patients was designed using criteria other than those commonly reported. They included combination of several markers and their dynamic evaluation of three different levels of increase: isolated elevated value (IEV), constant level of elevation (CE), and progressive increase (PI). In a total of 90 patients, the levels of combined serum CEA-TPA and GICA were serially measured, and in 71 of them, CA 72.4 and CA 195 levels were also determined. The tumor markers were measured during the first few months after surgery, and the usefulness of combined CEA-TPA-GICA and other, possibly more favorable combinations was determined in relation to \"early\" detection of recurrence and development of metastases. In addition the usefulness of conventional radiologic examinations and the impact on patients survival following \"early\" diagnosis was evaluated. A positive correlation was found between elevated preoperative serum tumor marker levels and the stage of disease. The postoperative variation of high serum CEA values was useful in identifying micrometastases after primary tumor resection. In the \"early\" diagnosed 14 patients with recurrence during the postoperative follow-up period, the highest sensitivity was found for TPA (87%) and, of the marker combinations, TPA-GICA (93%) with a lead time of 4.6 +/- 5.6 and 5.4 +/- 7.8 months (mean +/- SD) respectively. In nonrelapsed patients, falsely positive results of TPA-GICA (25%) were fewer than those for TPA-CA 195 (31%) and TPA-GICA-CA72-4 (35%). However, TPA-CA 195 and TPA-GICA-CA72-4, based upon their high sensitivity in patients with metastases, seemed in keeping with the effectiveness of TPA-GICA for monitoring of postoperative patients with colorectal cancer. In patients who developed recurrences, PI was more frequently present than IEV. In patients without recurrence, the opposite occurred. CE had less frequently discriminatory capability between these two groups than IEV and PI. Routine radiographic studies were ineffective whereas liver echography with its high sensitivity revealed the first sign of recurrence. Eight (50%) of the 16 relapses (two patients relapsed twice) were suitable for surgery because only one organ with a single metastasis was involved. Three (75%) of the 4 patients with \"early\" diagnosis of recurrence are alive without evidence of disease 5, 18, and 20 months after the last surgery. The results of this study revealed the importance of \"early\" diagnosis of recurrence for improved survival of patients with colorectal cancer."}

To review predictors of outcome, including sequencing of modalities and pretreatment findings for adjuvantly treated rectal cancer. From 1975 through 1990, 307 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum underwent adjuvant radiation therapy. In 251 cases the radiation therapy was administered preoperatively, either 40-50 Gy (median dose 45 Gy) followed in 6-7 weeks by surgery (210 cases), or 20 Gy in five fractions immediately prior to surgery (41 cases). In 56 cases, patients were referred postoperatively for radiation (median dose 50 Gy). Adjuvant chemotherapy was never given concurrently with the preoperative radiation (RT), although 43 of the cases (including 14 of the preoperative RT cases) received postoperative chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis (Cox model) indicated that significant predictors of better overall freedom from disease were preoperative rather than postoperative RT (p < 0.001), low surgical stage (p < 0.0001), specialist surgeon (p = 0.007), low or moderate histologic grade (p = 0.026), and proximal lesion (p = 0.033). The significant predictors for better local control included use of preoperative RT (p < 0.001), low or moderate grade (p = 0.001), and low surgical stage (p = 0.015). The 5-year local control and freedom from disease for the preoperative RT patients were 90% +/- 2% and 73% +/- 3%, respectively. The selected cases that received the short course of 20 Gy preoperatively did well. Although 24 out of 41 patients proved to have Astler Coller B2 or C disease, local control at last follow-up was 39 out of 41 (95%). A second multivariate analysis of pretreatment factors was performed on the preoperative RT cases. The significant factors for both local control and overall freedom from disease were noncircumferential vs. circumferential tumor, proximal vs. distal lesion, and background of the surgeon. Additional negative factors on univariate analysis (although not achieving independent significance on multivariate analysis) included the finding of near-obstructing lesions and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Grade > or = 3 sequelae occurred in 8% of cases (including 3% bowel obstruction). The only significant factor for complications was background of the surgeon (4% for colorectal specialists vs. 12% for nonspecialists, p = 0.015). Significant factors for better tumor control included preoperative as opposed to postoperative RT and the experience of the surgeon. In selected cases, excellent results can be obtained with a short course of preoperative radiation. Concurrent chemotherapy need not be given routinely with preoperative radiation. Subgroups of preoperative RT cases at risk for distant metastases (who might benefit from postoperative chemotherapy), and at high risk for local failure (for whom concurrent preoperative chemotherapy and radiation might be considered), are identified."}

In 24 patients of Group 1 IS was performed even at the time of their admission for primary cancer. 7 patients underwent RIGE for primary cancer and 16 in the follow-up. IORIL was performed in 12 patients with primary cancer and in 16 in the course of reoperation. The radioimmunodiagnostic methods were performed after a single administration of the radiolabeled MAb (111In F(ab')2 a-CEA and 111In B72.3). The radioimmunoassisted follow-up plan detected a greater number of recurrences than traditional examinations (27% vs 13%). The rates of radical reoperation in Group 1 and 2 were 61% and 37% respectively. 33% of the patients of Group 2 were alive 24 months after radical reoperation vs 62.5% of the patients of Group 1. Immunoscintigraphy demonstrated a good sensitivity and specificity, mainly in the detection of pelvic recurrences (sens. 92%, spec. 84%). The radioimmunoassisted follow-up plan was well accepted by the patients. RIGE led to the detection of 3 periluminal recurrences of rectal cancer that traditional investigations failed to demonstrate and in 5 cases influenced the patients management. IORIL detected minimal tumor foci (2 mm.) where pre and intraoperative study were negative, while the histopathologic examination gave evidence of tumor. Considering that the costs of the radioimmunodiagnostic methods and of traditional examinations are very similar, we can conclude that the radioimmunoassisted follow-up plan has a favorable cost/benefit rate and a remarkable impact on the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer."}

A study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between raised carcinoembryonic antigen level and the recurrence of colorectal cancer in patients following a curative primary resection. Retrospective analysis was carried out on the notes of 125 patients who had attended a dedicated hospital colorectal follow-up clinic between 1988 and 1992.

To determine whether an intensified follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer can lead to improved reresectability and a better long-term survival. A prospective randomized trial of 106 patients. Oulu University Hospital, a referral center in northern Finland. A total of 106 consecutive patients who underwent radical resection for colorectal cancer, 54 of whom were randomized into a conventional follow-up group and 52 into an intensified follow-up group. After a 5-year follow-up, the time of detection of recurrence, the recurrence rates, the first method showing recurrence, the mode of recurrence, reresectability, and survival were compared between the groups. The recurrences were identified earlier in the intensified follow-up group than in the conventional follow-up group (mean +/- SD, 10 +/- 5 months vs 15 +/- 10 months). The overall recurrence rate was 41%, with 39% in the conventional group and 42% in the intensified group. Carcinoembryonic antigen determination was the most common method showing recurrence in both groups. Endoscopy and ultrasound were beneficial in the intensified follow-up group, but computed tomography failed to improve the diagnostics. The mode of recurrence did not differ between the groups. Radical resections were performed on 19% (8/43) of the patients, 14% (3/21) in the conventional group and 22% (5/22) in the intensified group. The cumulative 5-year survival was 54% in the conventional group and 59% in the intensified group. Earlier detection of recurrent colorectal cancer by intensified follow-up does not lead to either significantly increased reresectability or improved 5-year survival."}

Six cases in group A were H1, 4 were H2, and 2 were H3; 12 cases in group B were H1, and 3 were H2. In both groups, primary lesions were removed. All cases received high-dose intermittent 5-FU infusion (WHF) at 1,000 mg/m2 via a reservoir for 5 hours a week at the outpatient clinic. Cumulative survival rates for 1 and 3 years are 100% and 68.6%, respectively, in group A, and 58.7% and 25.2% in group B, which indicates the treatment outcome in group A was significantly better. Recurrence in residual liver was not found in group A except for one case whose tumor was unremoved, but it was found in 8 cases (53.3%) in group B up to this writing. CEA value after resection in group A was within the normal range except for one case with a local recurrence. It seems that intra-arterial 5-FU infusion chemotherapy for residual liver after resection of hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer has a preventive effect on residual liver, and the improvement of the cumulative survival rate can be expected."}

Approximately 70% of patients who are going to develop tumor recurrence following curative colorectal surgery do so within 24 months of surgery. The relationship was prospectively examined between an ongoing acute-phase response and subsequent clinical relapse in 36 colorectal cancer patients who had undergone a curative resection. Approximately 4 months after their operation, patients were grouped according to the presence (n = 15) or absence (n = 21) of an acute-phase response (C-reactive protein > 5 mg/L) and were followed-up for a minimum of 24 months. Age, tumor site, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations were similar in both groups. There was a significantly higher recurrence rate in patients with an acute-phase response (11 of 15) compared to those with no acute-phase response (2 of 21, P < 0.01). These results are consistent with the presence of an acute-phase response being an important predictive factor in the early stages of tumor recurrence in patients who have had apparently curative colorectal surgery."}

The intraoperative detection of tumors by means of a gamma-ray detector that recognized radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) on tumour cell surfaces has been shown to be feasible and clinically useful. The technology is called the Radioimmunoguided Surgery (RIGS) system. We have been working with this system for five years and in this paper we report our experience using different radiolabelled MoAbs and methods in terms of clinical utility in patients with primary or recurrent colorectal cancer. In the first part of the experience we injected with the MoAb B72.3 a group of 66 patients with primary (36) or recurrent (30) cancer introducing for 7 out of 66 a variation of the method to try to overcome some limits of the original procedure. With the new method, based on the avidin-biotin binding, it is possible to use anti-Cea MoAbs and to reduce the preoperative waiting time, injecting biotinylated MoAbs and avidin. In the second part of the experience, a second group of 15 patients with primary (12) and recurrent (3) cancer was injected with biotinylated MoAbs FO23C5 (anti-Cea) while in a third group of 16 patients, 6 with primary and 10 with recurrent cancer a cocktail of antibodies was used. During surgery a probe (NEOPROBE) was used to count obvious tumor, surrounding normal tissue and to scan the abdomen for areas of increased radioactivity. In the first group of patients tumour was localized by probe in 18/36 (50%) cases of primary cancer and in 24 out of 30 recurrences (80%). In the second group tumour was localized in 8/12 (67%) primary cancers and in 2 out of 3 (67%) recurrences. In the last group primary tumours were localized in 5/6 (83%) patients and recurrent cancer in 7/10 (70%). The method altered the surgical procedure in 2 out of 36 primary tumours (6%) and in 8 out of 30 recurrences (27%) injected with the B72.3. In the group of 15 patients injected with the anti-Cea the method changed the surgical strategy in 2/12 (16%) primaries and in 1 out of 3 recurrences. We had no real clinical utility in the primary cancers injected with cocktails but in 4 out of 10 (40%) patients with recurrent cancer it was possible to localize occult metastatic tissue. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the different MoAbs is similar in the groups even though it is noted that B72.3 seems to be more indicated in recurrent cancers and the FO23C5 in primary tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}

Surveillance for a second primary colon or rectal cancer, detection and treatment of recurrent disease, and health maintenance are the essential components of follow-up of a patient population with potentially curative resection of a primary large bowel cancer. The value of follow-up programs have been extensively studied with colorectal cancer. Of 100 colorectal cancer patients in a follow-up program, approximately 20 patients should have prolongation of life as a result of surveillance, detection and treatment, and health maintenance. Detection of recurrent cancer and its treatment may be the most expensive and least effective part of the follow-up program. Lead time is minimal with intensive follow-up (including serial CEA blood tests) when compared to the time of diagnosis derived from symptoms of recurrent malignancy in an informed patient. Aggressive reoperative surgery in selected patients with recurrent disease with use of adjunctive radiation therapy and chemotherapy when appropriate, will salvage long term the greatest number of people and yield some palliative benefits. It is crucial that reoperative surgery be pursued by an experienced team familiar with this type of intervention. Comprehensive follow-up of colorectal cancer patients has a high value in its medical economic cost and should continue to be pursued, studied, to become more cost effective, and integrated into a complete management plan."}

Measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in human serum is frequently used to detect tumor recurrence in patients with resected primary colorectal cancers. These levels are highly variable from patient to patient, and the mechanism that determines these levels is still poorly understood. Using a 6-h in vitro CEA-release assay, we determined that a factor in human and fetal bovine sera significantly augments the release of CEA from the tumor cell surface into cell culture supernatants. As little as 1% serum admixed with tumor cells results in CEA release up to 200% greater than that of serum-free controls. It is not inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline or heat inactivation (of serum) but is calcium dependent. The electrophoretic mobility and membrane linkage of CEA released by serum appear to be identical to those of CEA released by bacterial phospholipase C. Because bacterial phospholipase C is known specifically to cleave the phosphoinositol (PI) glycan moiety that anchors CEA to the tumor cell surface, a mechanism of action for serum cleaving this anchor is suggested. The large range of CEA levels observed in patients with colorectal cancers may be related to differential sensitivity of the CEA membrane anchor to the CEA-releasing factor in serum."}

The data were correlated with post-operative TNM-staging. Patients with colorectal carcinomas had significantly higher serum levels of tenascin than the control group. At the 95% level of specificity, sensitivity was 25%. Tumor grading obviously had no influence on the level of tenascin in serum. With increasing pT-category, tenascin levels increased as well. In patients with distant metastatic disease, serum tenascin levels were significantly higher than in patients without distant metastases. These data suggest that, in colorectal carcinoma, the preoperative level of serum tenasin reflects the total tumor burden and correlates with metastatic disease. Our observation warrants a prospective study of the relevance of tenascin serum levels with regard to prognosis and as an indicator of relapse."}

A prospective study was carried out in 100 patients subjected to surgical resection of colon adenocarcinoma. Serum concentrations of these markers were determined the day before surgery and seven days, two months, and six months after surgery. The results demonstrate that sensitivity increased as the disease spread and that CA 19-9 was the most sensitive tumor marker. The rate of false negatives was 40 percent for Dukes Stage A lesions, 19 percent for Dukes Stage B, 7 percent for Dukes Stage C, and 0 percent for Dukes Stage D. Determination of two markers (CA 19-9 and CEA) provided the greatest sensitivity in Stages A and D tumors (60 percent and 100 percent, respectively); the incidence did not change when measurements of other antigens were associated. For Stages B and C, determination of at least three markers was necessary, the association of CEA, TPA, and CA 19-9 being that which showed the greatest sensitivity, 78 percent and 91 percent, respectively. It would be advisable to include monoclonal antibody determination of CEA, TPA, and CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, despite the fact that ultimate sensitivity will depend on the degree of tumor extension or on the presence of metastasis."}

The aim of our study was to assess the clinical relevance of these markers and to determine whether their use in monitoring the course of the disease can reduce the need for serial imaging procedures. At baseline, pathologically elevated TPS levels occurred in 90% of patients. CEA was elevated in 73%, CA 19-9 in 59% and CA-195 in 68%. With a detection rate of > 90% in both advanced colorectal (n = 37) and pancreatic cancer (n = 20), and of 75% in gastric cancer (n = 12), TPS was the most sensitive marker in all three tumour types included in this analysis. Serial evaluations of TPS and other biochemical markers were available in 39 patients undergoing palliative systemic chemotherapy. Treatment with a fluorouracil-based regimen resulted in a partial response in 5/27 patients with colorectal cancer, whereas 2/12 patients with pancreatic cancer responded to therapy with a high-dose epirubicin combination regimen. All other patients had disease stabilisation or suffered from progressive disease. When compared with the results of serial CT scanning, the TPS correlated best with the course of the disease, the positive predictive value being 75% for a partial response, 96% for stable disease and partial response combined and 100% for progressive disease. The corresponding values for CEA were 50%, 81% and 62% and were similar to those for CA 19-9 and CA-195. In summary, TPS seems to represent a sensitive, clinically relevant and specific marker of proliferative activity in gastrointestinal cancer. According to our preliminary results in colorectal and pancreatic cancer, TPS may be considered as the primary means of monitoring treatment, and imaging reduced to confirm the response."}

The goal of this study was to intraindividually compare a complete versus a fragmented, directly 99mTc-labeled, monoclonal anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody, with respect to their antigen-targeting kinetics, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy in patients with CEA-expressing tumors. Twenty-five patients were investigated with the 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA IgG1 BW 431/26 and the F(ab')2/Fab' fragment mixture F023C5 within 7 days. For quantitative analysis, the region of interest technique was applied to planar scans, whole-body scans, and single photon emission computed tomography slices 10 min to 48 h postinjection (PI). Final correlations were performed according to the histopathology after surgery or biopsy. Earliest tumor detection was possible with complete IgG1 4 h PI (52% of finally positive lesions). Twenty-four- or even 48-h scans were necessary in 48% of finally positive lesions; tumor detection with fragments was possible in 17% at 1 h PI and in 94% at 4 h PI. With both monoclonal antibodies, in 35%, single photon emission computed tomography was necessary for tumor detection. Absolute antibody uptake in tumor lesions was higher with complete monoclonal antibodies than with fragments. The sensitivity of fragments was higher in detecting primary tumors, local recurrences, and lymph node metastases. For detection of liver metastases, sensitivity was also higher for fragments than for IgG (87 versus 73%), but in scintigraphically positive lesions, tumor:background ratios were significantly lower with fragments (1.26 +/- 0.12 versus 1.70 +/- 0.32; P < 0.01). Therefore, fragments seem to be more suitable for earlier detection of lesions known for their good vascularization, vascular permeability, and antigen accessibility, such as local recurrences, lymph node metastases, and peritoneal carcinomatoses. In liver metastases (high interstitial pressure, low vascular leakage), sensitivity of fragments is higher, but their rapid serum and whole-body clearance lead to a lower absolute antibody uptake, with the consequence of significantly lower tumor:background ratios than with IgG."}

Despite major advances in diagnostic testing, including the introduction and widespread availability of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, inadequate diagnostic information still interferes with proper management of many patients with cancers. This is particularly true for recurrent colorectal cancer, for example. In the course of this symposium, significant advances have been reported which are likely to improve management of this clinical situation. 111In, oncoscint for colorectal and ovarian cancer imaging, has been approved for single use only, and is a product licensed by the Food and Drug Administration. It has been shown to be significantly more effective than CT for detecting the presence of disease that is confined to the abdomen outside the liver. This agent is very useful in a limited role. A larger opportunity awaits other preparations reported at this conference, especially 99mTc-labeled Immu-4 carcinoembryonic antigen, which is significantly better than CT for determining resectability of recurrent cancer (T. Behr et al., Cancer Res. 55 (Suppl.): 5777S-5785S, 1995). The 99mTc-labeled compound preparations offer the advantages of low immunogenicity, excellent imaging energies of 99mTc, and \"same-day\" imaging. Even the most effective cancer treatment such as surgical resection, if applied to a patient who basically does not need it, can be a needless expense and a trauma to the patient. To date, our emphasis in oncology research has been heavily weighted toward developing new therapies. The success of radioimmunodetection is one indication of why it is time for a paradigm shift, during which we can move toward a more balanced program that emphasizes both diagnosis and therapy. To achieve this we must urge research institutions such as the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society to make major investments in the diagnostic aspects of cancer care. With the knowledge base that we have now, we can make improvements in patient care by emphasizing development of improved diagnostic methods and support for cost-effectiveness studies for developed methods, in order that currently available treatments can be more intelligently applied."}

A longitudinal evaluation of colorectal cancer patients suggested the utility of combining the measurement of tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 with that of carcinoembryonic antigen to monitor disease status not only at the time of diagnosis, but also at the time of recurrence. Several reports have indicated that the expression of some tumor antigens in colorectal adenomas may correlate with those parameters conventionally considered as indicative of malignant transformation. The presence of tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 in colorectal adenomas has been recently correlated with preneoplastic lesions, suggesting that tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 may be considered as an early marker of neoplastic transformation.

The sites of evaluable metastases were liver (10), peritoneum (4), lung (3) and others (6). The LV dosage was 30 mg/body (low-dose method) and the FU dosage was 500-750 mg/body. Both drugs were administered either 5 days/every 4 weeks or one day/every 1 to 2 weeks via protracted or bolus infusion. The regimen was generally well tolerated, although 9 pts (53%) experienced toxicity which required dose reductions. Overall response rate was 29% (5 PR). No CR was observed. Improvement in tumor-related symptoms was noted temporarily in 7 out of 10 pts. Serum CEA level decreased in 13 out of 14 pts.

Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) by means of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies and a probe has been reported to be useful in recognizing subclinical tumor deposits during operation. Aim of this study was to understand the limits of this technique and to assess the potential diagnostic use of RIGS in colorectal cancer surgery. Monoclonal antibody B72.3 reacting with TAG 72 antigen, labeled with iodine 125, was injected in 32 patients with primary tumors and in 22 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer. One hundred thirty-three suspected tumor sites were evaluated during operation by means of probe and resected with immunohistochemistry as control. Primary tumor sites were localized by RIGS in 60% of cases, and recurrent sites were localized in 82% of cases. There was a significant correlation both for primary (p < 0.001) and recurrent (p < 0.001) tumor sites between intraoperative RIGS findings and TAG 72 tumor antigen expression. Results obtained with the probe were instrumental in modifying the surgical approach in six (27%) of 22 patients with recurrences, allowing the removal of tumor masses that would otherwise have been overlooked. The results of RIGS seems to be encouraging in terms of clinical use. The potential high diagnostic resolution appears to improve surgical ablation of colorectal cancer, especially in patients with recurrent cancer or suspected recurrent tumors who have negative results for intraabdominal disease by all other roentgenographic criteria with rising carcinoembryonic antigen or TAG 72 antigen levels."}

The prognosis for colorectal cancer patients is related closely to the extent of tumor at the time of diagnosis, and early detection of metastatic or recurrent disease is an important prerequisite for successful treatment. Radioimmunodetection is a relatively new technique to image colorectal cancer using radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies (MoAb). The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical use of radioimmunodetection with the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen MoAb FO23C5, radiolabelled with 131I, in patients submitted to surgery for colorectal cancer and with suspected local recurrences. The results of radioimmunodetection were compared with those of computed tomography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other diagnostic techniques (gastrointestinal x-ray, endoscopy, and, in selected cases, a surgical second look). Fifty-nine patients with a rise in carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels or a clinical suspicion of recurrences entered the study. Scintigraphy was performed at multiple interval times (4-100 hours) after an intravenous injection of radiolabelled FO23C5 F(ab')2 fragments. The cumulative results showed the high sensitivity (89%), specificity (78%), and accuracy (86%) of radioimmunodetection. Of the radiologic methods, only magnetic resonance imaging had the same accuracy (86%), with lower specificity (64%) and higher sensitivity (93%). Computed tomographic scan and ultrasonography displayed the poorest accuracy (68% and 47%, respectively). Radioimmunodetection is an important imaging technique that can be used in clinical practice for the follow-up of the patient with colorectal carcinoma."}

Radioimmunodetection of cancer using monoclonal antibody fragments offers certain potential advantages over that with whole monoclonal antibodies, including the ability to image early (i.e., to provide images at an early time after injection of the radioantibody) while minimizing the incidence of human anti-mouse antibody response. This paper reports a prospective trial comparing radioimmunodetection with IMMU-4 (a murine anti-CEA monoclonal antibody) 99mTc-labeled Fab' fragments to conventional imaging in 35 colorectal cancer patients. All patients were investigated by conventional diagnostic methods (CDM) within 4 weeks of radioimmunodetection. Surgical corroboration of findings was obtained in 26 patients (15 with evidence of disease on CDM [CDM+] and 11 with abnormal serum CEA [CDM-] as the only evidence for recurrence). After 1 mg IMMU-4 99mTc-Fab' was injected (19.3 mCi on average), patients underwent planar/SPECT radioimmunodetection 2-5 hours later and planar radioimmunodetection 18-24 hours later. Three patients underwent a second radioimmunodetection study 16, 20 and 23 months after the first. Radioimmunodetection was superior to CDM, accurately predicting disease distribution in six nonsurgical and ten CDM+ surgical patients, and was complementary to computed tomography in two nonsurgical and two CDM+ surgical patients. Radioimmunodetection would have directed or changed management decisions in 6 of the 15 (40%) CDM+ surgical patients. Radioimmunodetection correctly identified all recurrent tumor in 8 of 11 CDM- surgical patients and was negative in one patient with cirrhosis and no recurrence, representing a potential clinical benefit of 82%. Analyzed on a regional basis, radioimmunodetection was found to be superior to CDM in extrahepatic abdomen and pelvis imaging and was complementary to (although not as accurate as) CDM in the liver. Human anti-mouse antibody did not develop in any of the patients, including three who were injected twice. IMMU-4 99mTc-Fab' radioimmunodetection shows promise as a clinically useful diagnostic tool in patients with colorectal cancer, detecting disease often missed by conventional imaging. IMMU-4 99mTc-Fab' may prove useful for serial radioimmunodetection studies, because human anti-mouse antibody response does not appear to be a problem with this radioimmunoconjugate. It also has the advantage of permitting same-day imaging."}

Value in follow-up and as a prognosticator. Preoperative plasma prolactin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were assessed to monitor disease recurrence and to identify low-risk and high-risk patients with Dukes B or C colorectal cancer. Prolactin and CEA were estimated by radioimmunoassay method. Blood samples were collected preoperatively and sequentially thereafter from patients with colorectal cancer (N = 114); the samples were compared with samples from age-matched healthy control subjects (smokers and nonsmokers, N = 45). For rest of the analysis, patients with Dukes A disease (N = 7) were not included because of the small number. In monitoring recurrences, the criteria for positive test for the two markers was a continual increase in the marker level after an initial decrease or persistent high level of the marker. These were the indicators of relapse or no response to treatment. To determine the efficacy of the preoperative markers, the patients were grouped according to disease status at the end of 3 years, i.e., patients who had response to the treatment modalities (N = 52) and patients who later had progressive disease (N = 55). To determine the prognostic significance of preoperative marker levels, the patients were divided according to the cutoff levels (upper normal limits); for prolactin the cutoff level was 20.0 ng/ml plasma, and for CEA it was 5.0 ng/ml plasma. Both of the markers were significantly high in patients with colorectal cancer compared with the markers of their respective control subjects (P < 0.0001). In monitoring disease course, the predictive power of prolactin was 100%, whereas that of CEA was 66%. Prolactin showed a lead time of 2-3 months. Preoperative prolactin levels were significantly higher in patients who later had progressive disease (P < 0.001) than in patients who had response to the treatments. However, such an intergroup variation was not observed for CEA. Patients with preoperative levels of prolactin greater than 20.0 ng/ml had shorter overall survival times than did those with prolactin levels less than 20.0 ng/ml plasma; such a trend was not observed for patients with CEA levels less than 5.0 ng/ml and those with CEA levels greater than 5.0 ng/ml plasma. Prolactin is a better overall marker than is CEA in patients with Dukes B or C colorectal cancer. The authors recommend the use of plasma prolactin levels to help identify low-risk and high-risk patient subgroups so that high-risk patients may be followed up more intensely and treated accordingly. Hyperprolactinemic patients with Dukes B or C disease have shortened survival time."}

The therapeutic efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FUra; 0.6 mg/day x 5 days) + leucovorin (LV; 1.8 mg/day x 5 days) and of 131I-labeled MN-14 anticarcinoembryonic antigen IgG (275 microCi single dose) was evaluated in size-matched (0.3-0.7 cm3) s.c. LoVo, HT-29, DLD-1, HCT-15, LS174T, and MOSER, GW-39, and WidR human colonic tumors. These lines express varying amounts of carcinoembryonic antigen and exhibit varying degrees of in vitro responsiveness to 5-FUra. Unlike radioimmunotherapy (RAIT), multiple cycles of chemotherapy were feasible over a 3-week period. However, no therapeutic advantage to a second cycle of 5-FUra/LV administration was found. Therefore, it is reasonable to compare single cycles of both treatment modalities. RAIT was statistically more effective in 5 of 8 tumor lines (LoVo, LS174T, MOSER, WidR, and GW-39). In 1 other line (DLD-1), RAIT was marginally more efficacious, but tumors responded well to both therapies. The lack of a statistical difference between the 2 modalities of treatment may indicate that the efficacy of the 2 treatments is equivalent, or the relatively large variability within the treatment groups may have prevented significance given the number of animals evaluated. RAIT and 5-FUra/LV were equally efficacious in the HT-29 and the HCT-15 tumor lines. Of the 5 xenografts that responded better to RAIT, 3 lines (LS174T, GW-39, and WidR) demonstrated a greater percentage of tumors responding over a 5- to 6-week period. The other 3 lines (LoVo, MOSER, and DLD-1) exhibited a similar percent of tumors responding to both therapies, but a greater growth inhibition in those RAIT-treated tumors that responded. In vitro responsiveness to 5-FUra/LV did not directly correlate with in vivo responsiveness (r2 = -0.664), since LS174T and LoVo tumors, with rapid growth rates (0.05-0.36 cm3/day), were not highly responsive to therapy. Growth inhibition from RAIT also did not correlate with total tumor carcinoembryonic antigen content (r2 = 0.003), an observation that may be due to additional variables, such as accessibility of antigen and innate radiosensitivity of the tumor. RAIT was most effective in the fastest growing tumor lines (LS174T, GW-39, MOSER, WidR, and LoVo). These preclinical results suggest an advantage to radioantibody therapy over one of the most commonly used forms of chemotherapy to treat colorectal cancer. These studies also highlight the need to establish criteria that will enable the selection of therapeutic modalities in patients."}

Results of a survey of members of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. The follow-up of patients after potentially curative resection of colon cancer has important clinical and financial implications for patients and society, yet the ideal surveillance strategy is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the current follow-up practice pattern of a large, diverse group of experts. The 1,663 members of The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons were asked, via a detailed questionnaire, how often they request nine discrete follow-up evaluations in their patients treated for cure with TNM Stage I, II, or III colon cancer over the first five posttreatment years. These evaluations were clinic visit, complete blood count, liver function tests, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, chest x-ray, bone scan, computerized tomographic scan, colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy. Forty-six percent (757/1663) completed the survey and 39 percent (646/1663) provided evaluable data. The results indicate that members of The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons generally conduct follow-up on their patients personally after performing colon cancer surgery (rather than sending them back to their referral source). Routine clinic visits and CEA levels are the most frequently performed items for each of the five years. The large majority (> 75 percent) of surgeons see their patients every 3 to 6 months for years 1 and 2, then every 6 to 12 months for years 3, 4, and 5. Approximately 80 percent of respondents obtain CEA levels every 3 to 6 months for years 1, 2, and 3, and every 6 to 12 months for years 4 and 5. Colonoscopy is performed annually by 46 to 70 percent of respondents, depending on year. A chest x-ray is obtained yearly by 46 to 56 percent, depending on year. The majority of the members of The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons do not routinely request computerized tomographic scan or bone scan at any time. There is great variation in the pattern of use of complete blood count and liver function tests. Members of The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons from the United States tend to follow their patients more closely than do those living in other countries. The intensity of follow-up does not markedly vary across TNM Stages I to III. The surveillance strategies reported here rely most heavily on clinic visits and CEA level determinations, generally reflecting guidelines previously proposed in the current literature."}

Pretreatment characteristics (age, gender, disease site, CEA and stage) and the pattern of follow-up were similar in both groups. For the first 5 years following randomisation, relapse-free survival and overall survival were similar in the two treatment groups. Subsequently, excess late mortality was associated with levamisole group assignment. Consequently, overall survival was somewhat greater in the placebo group than in the levamisole group, 68% vs 38% (P < 0.08). For patients surviving 5 years from randomisation, subsequent survival favoured placebo over levamisole (100% vs 57%; P < 0.03). The absolute numbers of deaths were 27 in the levamisole group (19 definitely cancer related) and seven in the group placebo (five definitely cancer related). This long-term result seen with a more intensive adjuvant levamisole dose and schedule suggests: (1) other levamisole adjuvant trials in patients with colorectal cancer should be examined for long-term outcome; (2) future trials utilising the even higher levamisole dosage required for clinical immunomodulation should proceed cautiously."}

Occult hepatic metastases were detected by IOUS imaging alone in 5% of patients. Restriction of IOUS imaging to patients with T3 or T4 lesions or recurrent cancers would have identified all metastases and increased the detection rate to 10%. Occult metastases were detected by IOUS imaging alone in 12.5% of patients with T3, N0 lesions. The rate of false-negative findings on IOUS imaging was 13% overall, 0% for patients with T1 or T2 lesions, 3% for patients with node-negative findings, and 7% for patients with T3, N0 lesions. The small increment in the detection of occult metastases by IOUS liver imaging does not warrant its use in all patients with colorectal cancer. Selective use in patients with T3 or T4 lesions or recurrent cancers increased the incremental gain in detection. The observed frequency of occult metastases in patients with T3, N0 lesions is sufficient to impact on results of adjuvant chemotherapy trials. Longer follow-up in more patients is needed to determine whether a negative IOUS study is an additional favorable prognosticator in patients with T1 and T2 lesions and node-negative findings."}

Predictive value and implications for adjuvant treatment based on multivariate analysis. The object of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pre- and postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the resectional treatment of colorectal hepatic metastases. The main question was whether postoperative CEA levels correlated with survival and the time to recurrence. Despite numerous investigations on prognostic factors in colorectal cancer, only sparse data are available to estimate the patient's individual risk for tumor recurrence postoperatively. It is controversial whether preoperative CEA values are of prognostic significance, and after observing the kinetics of CEA decline, elevated CEA levels postoperatively were found to be an ominous sign. CEA therefore could indicate the presence of a tumor burden after resection. One hundred sixty-six patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal metastases with curative intent were prospectively documented and underwent multivariate analysis for indicators of prognosis. Abnormal preoperative CEA levels were not of prognostic significance compared with values within the normal range (survival, 36 vs. 30 months; p = 0.12; disease-free survival, 12 vs. 10 months; p = 0.82). The postoperative serum CEA level, however, was the most predictive factor with regard to survival and the disease-free interval. Patients in whom CEA levels were abnormal before surgery and returned into the normal range after resection had significantly better survival times (37 vs. 23 months, p = 0.0001) and disease-free survival times (12 vs. 6.2 months, p = 0.0001) compared with patients with persistently abnormal values. Pre- and postoperative determination of the serum CEA level is mandatory to judge whether a curative resection has been performed and whether tumor has been left behind after the operation. Postoperative CEA levels also should be used as a stratification criterion in adjuvant treatment studies after hepatic resection to indicate patients with a high risk of tumor recurrence."}

Results of the scintigraphy were correlated with surgical findings. Twelve of 15 patients (80%) had true-positive (TP) scans when correlated with surgery. Two of 15 (13%) had true-negative (TN) scans inasmuch as exploratory laparotomy failed to detect recurrent disease. A false-positive (FP) scan was obtained in one of 15 (7%). There were no false-negative (FN) scans. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the positive predictive value (PPV) were 100%, 67%, 93%, and 92%, respectively. Twenty-six histologically confirmed areas of malignancy were found and correlated with areas of increased activity seen on IMMU-4 scintigraphy.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of a new tumour marker, CA-242, alone or in combination with CEA in the practical management of colorectal cancer patients after potentially curative resection. A cohort of 149 patients who had undergone 'curative' surgery was followed up according to an intensive protocol in order to detect recurrent disease. Over a median tumour marker follow-up period of 24 months there were 25 recurrences in 24 patients. Both CEA and CA-242 alone detected half the local recurrences. The sensitivity of CEA was 84% for distant or mixed recurrence compared with 64% for CA-242. An abnormality of either CEA or CA-242 enabled detection of five out of six local recurrences and 17 out of 19 distant or mixed recurrences with a median lead time of 5 months for each marker. Both markers were elevated concurrently in only one local and 11 distant recurrences. While CA-242 alone is not superior to CEA, their combined use (either abnormal) has a high sensitivity (88%), specificity (78%) and negative predictive value (97%); this may be useful in reducing unnecessary investigations in follow-up programmes and as a guide to the initiation of further treatment for recurrent disease."}

Patients undergoing potential curative resection of colorectal tumors (Dukes Stage A-C) entered a prospective, randomized trial comparing two follow-up regimens (to be reported separately) had CEA levels measured every 3 months for two years; then every 6 months for the next three years. In the study protocol, a rise in CEA was not an indication for investigation to determine recurrence unless there was also other evidence of recurrent disease. Three hundred eleven patients were followed for a median of 4.5 (range, 2-5) years. Recurrent disease developed in 98 (32 percent) patients, 57 of whom had an elevated CEA (sensitivity 58 percent), with a median lead time of six (range, 1-30) months from first abnormal CEA to diagnosis of recurrent disease by other means. The specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CEA as an indicator of subsequent recurrent disease was 93 percent, 79 percent, and 83 percent, respectively. The sensitivity of CEA for predicting hepatic metastases was 80 percent, with a median lead time of eight (range, 1-30) months, compared with only 46 percent for sites of recurrent disease other than the liver. CEA was the first indicator of recurrent disease in 58 percent of all patients and in 80 percent of patients with liver metastases. The diagnosis of recurrent disease may be made several months earlier by investigating the first abnormal CEA level, although any benefit in terms of survival remains to be proven."}

We present herein the cases of three patients with multiple liver metastases from colorectal cancer in whom complete remission was achieved by treatment with an HAI of IL-2 in combination with mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). These patients received an HAI of IL-2 at 8 x 10(5) JRU, 5-FU at 250 mg daily, and MMC at 4 mg once weekly for 3 weeks, being the induction regimen, after which they were discharged on maintenance therapy consisting of IL-2 at 2 x 10(6) JRU, 5-FU at 250 mg twice weekly, and MMC at 4 mg once weekly. It was evident from the liver CT scan taken after 2-3 months that the metastatic foci seen before therapy had clearly disappeared, while the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) had decreased to normal levels in all three patients. Pancytopenia was seen in one patient, but other laboratory studies of the hepatic and renal parameters were normal. The total lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood showed a mild decrease, while the lymphocyte phenotype study showed a notable increase in CD4+ cells and a decrease in CD8+ cells, with an elevation of a 4/8 ratio, in all cases during therapy.

The safety and efficacy of operations for gastrointestinal diseases in very elderly patients has been a matter of debate in recent years. One hundred seventy-seven instances of carcinoma of the colon and rectum in patients more than 80 years of age who wee surgically treated between 1961 and 1987 were reviewed. They were compared with 623 similar instances in patients younger than 80 years of age who were treated during the same time period. Octogenarians and nonagenarians significantly more often displayed obstruction or perforation, elevated preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen, right-sided lesions, and solitary hepatic metastases, when present. Patients more than 80 years of age received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy less often. Carcinoma recurrence in very elderly patients implied a very poor prognosis, with only a 4 percent salvage rate. The actuarial five year survival rate was 32 percent for the older patients and 48 percent in the younger group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in operative mortality between the two groups. In general, age alone should not alter treatment strategy in patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum."}

The metabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is complex and the reason for the low response rate of tumor patients to 5-FU is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether spectral parameters obtained noninvasively by in vivo 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to assess individual response to 5-FU chemotherapy. Eighteen patients with metastases of colorectal carcinoma treated with 5-FU were examined by 19F NMR at 1.5 T. The NMR signal intensity versus time curves were observed for the cytostatic and its catabolite alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). Clinical response to treatment was monitored by CT/MR imaging of the liver and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the serum. 5-FU levels observed in IV-treated patients correlate with volumes of metastases in the liver region examined with the 19F NMR coil (k = 0.77, p < .0001). 5-FU levels in patients at their initial 5-FU chemotherapy were related with clinical response determined after three cycles of treatment. In the group of patients with extensive liver involvement and IV treatment, responders (n = 3) had enhanced 5-FU levels compared to nonresponders (n = 3). FBAL data indicate an apparent saturation of 5-FU catabolism in the liver for 5-FU doses > 1 g infused during 10 min. Mean absolute concentrations of FBAL were about 1 mumol per gram liver tissue. 19F NMR spectroscopy could be used to guide dose escalation schemes or to assess the modulation of 5-FU metabolism by other drugs in combined chemotherapy."}

Transforming growth factor beta 1 regulates the expression of extracellular matrix adhesion molecules and the carcinoembryonic antigen gene family of glycoproteins in the Moser colon carcinoma cell line. Expression of fibronectin antisense RNA in the Moser cells down-regulated fibronectin mRNA expression and blocked the ability of transforming growth factor beta 1 to stimulate fibronectin secretion. Cells expressing antisense fibronectin RNA exhibited a higher rate of proliferation, changed their morphology, and produced more laminin in response to treatment with transforming growth factor beta 1. The stimulation of carcinoembryonic antigen secretion by transforming growth factor beta 1 (which normally lagged 10-16 h behind that of fibronectin secretion stimulated by transforming growth factor beta 1) was blocked by the expression of antisense fibronectin RNA. Thus, the stimulation of fibronectin secretion by transforming growth factor beta 1 was a prerequisite for subsequent stimulation of carcinoembryonic antigen secretion. In addition, the stimulation of the cellular expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and three carcinoembryonic antigen cross-reactive species of glycoproteins by transforming growth factor beta 1 was down-modulated in cells expressing antisense fibronectin RNA. We therefore conclude that fibronectin may play an important role in the mechanisms of transforming growth factor beta 1 regulation of the expression of carcino-embryonic antigen gene family of glycoproteins."}

The clinical significance of expression of the MDR1 gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in relation to the intrinsic drug resistance and progression of human colon cancer is largely unknown. To elucidate the role of P-gp in these cancers further, the frequency and intensity of P-gp and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunostaining were measured at the single-cell level and correlated with known prognostic indices (i.e., DNA ploidy, vessel/lymphatic microinvasion, histologic grade, and disease relapse). Fifty-two untreated Dukes' Stage B2 colon cancers were immunostained with the anti-P-gp monoclonal antibodies JSB-1 and HYB-241, and anti-CEA. DNA content and cell proliferation were measured by flow cytometry. JSB-1 and HYB-241 detected P-gp in 44 and 42 of 52 carcinomas, respectively, and CEA was found in 50 of the 52 tumors. The level of P-gp expression was not associated with DNA ploidy, indices of local invasiveness, or histologic grade. In a multivariate analysis, however, a high level of P-gp expression (as assessed by JSB-1), DNA aneuploidy, microinvasion, and single carcinoma cell invasion individually predicted disease relapse (P < 0.05). The results indicate that diffuse P-gp immunostaining is present in the majority of Stage B2 human colon cancers and therefore may be an important contributor to their intrinsic drug resistance. The association between a high level of P-gp expression and disease relapse suggests that P-gp can be of prognostic value in Stage B2 colon cancers."}

The pathological assessment of rectal cancer remained essentially unchanged for 50 years and it is based mainly on Dukes' classification and histological granding. Alternative methods of classifications have also been developed but, actually, Dukes'taging is the most important prognostic factor. The limit of Dukes' classification is the incomplete discrimination between high risk and low risk patients into the same stages. The measurements of cellular DNA content by flow cytometry is emerging as a prognostic aid in many human tumours. Authors analyze on the basis of their experience on 116 curative operations for the cancer of the rectum, the relationship between tumour's features, CEA, symptoms, recurrences, survival, type of operation and DNA flow cytometry. In 100 cases they studied the percentage of cells in \"s\" phase. (SPF). Samples of flow-cytometry were prepared using paraffin-embedded tumour blocks. The authors didn't find any statistically significant relation among pathological features, staging, ploidy and SPF. Recurrences rate was 16.6% in diploid tumours and 23% in no diploid (p = 0.3). In SPF < 25% it was 18.2% (p = 0.5). 5-year survival was worse in aneuploid patients (p = 0.06). Using Cox' multivariate regression analysis, ploidy has not independent prognostic significance. In conclusion authors consider ploidy a prognostic factor in rectal cancer, but not independent. However, authors conclude that flow cytometry could help in early staging of the disease, especially in preoperative diagnosis. Flow cytometry has a prognostic significance with informations on tumoral biology and could contribute to select patients for adjuvant therapy or different surgical techniques."}

Results of this survey were compared to results of an earlier survey, held in 1985. Both surveys indicate that there is no consensus on the follow-up of patients at risk of hepatic metastases. Especially the interpretation of unexplained rises in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels leads to much controversy. Only 37% of the hospitals performing liver surgery were willing to perform second-look laparotomies based on CEA only. Also there is no agreement on the maximum number of liver metastases that will justify partial liver resection for cure. Clearly, there is a need for prospective randomized trials on which a more rational policy regarding hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients can be based."}

The management of patients with colorectal cancer, in particular, has been aided by developments in immunoscintigraphy. The new, safe, and easy-to-prepare MoAbs make possible an effective form of colon and rectal cancer imaging that has been used for (1) staging primary colorectal tumors in presurgical patients, (2) determining extent of disease, (3) continuing surveillance of patients at risk for recurrence of disease, (4) managing patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels (even those with otherwise negative workup results), and (5) imaging for occult, disease in patients both before and after surgery.

Seven patients with primary or recurrent gastrointestinal cancer in whom liver metastases were also detected were studied. Accumulation of radioactivity in the primary tumor was seen in only one patient. Visualization of the liver metastases was achieved in all patients. Thus detection of liver metastasis was better than in primary or recurrent tumors. While tumor visualization was most often seen in the 3 day image, optimal visualization of the tumor was seen at 5-7 days. There was no correlation between the serum concentration of CEA or CA19-9 and the visualization of tumors. Serum kinetics of I-131 IMACIS-1 showed biexponential components with a 1st phase T1/2 of 5.0 hours and 2nd phase T1/2 of 34.7 hours.

Two-step tumour targetting was performed by a first injection of 0.1 mg kg-1 of unlabelled bispecific antibody conjugate (an anti-CEA Fab' fragment chemically coupled to an anti-diethylene triamine pentaacetate (DTPA)-indium fragment) followed 4 to 5 days later by injection of the bivalent DTPA hapten labelled with 5 to 8 mCi 111In. Planar scintigraphy, single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) 360 degrees acquisitions and whole-body scans were obtained 4.5 and 24 h after injection of the radiolabelled hapten.

Two hundred catheters were surgically implanted to perform intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy in patients with multiple unresectable isolated liver tumors. The origins of these tumours were colorectal cancer in 152 cases, neuroendocrine tumour in 13 cases, hepatocellular carcinoma in 9 cases, and miscellaneous tumours in 22 cases. The hepatic arteries were ligated in 32% of the cases. Resection of the primary or local recurrence was performed at the same time in respectively 41% and 16% of the cases. The use of only one catheter was always possible, and the ligations of miscellaneous accessory hepatic arteries did not modify the therapeutic results. There were no postoperative deaths. Numerous complications occurred during local chemotherapy, mainly digestive and hepatobiliary complications (38.5% of the cases). Early discontinuation of local chemotherapy was due to the occurrence of thrombosis of the hepatic artery in 23% of the cases (after a mean delay of 5.2 months) and to the occurrence of digestive or hepato-biliary complications in 11% of the cases. The rate of objective response was 44%, with 22 complete and 62 partial responses on morphologic examination.

Although radiation can reduce the development of local recurrence and can provide palliation to many patients with localized disease, it is not curative. The authors and others have used the technique of abdominal sacral resection (ABSR) with or without pelvic exenteration to resect pelvic recurrence and its musculoskeletal extensions in selected patients with satisfactory long-term survival. The technique of ABSR with or without pelvic exenteration or resection of pelvic viscera, which the authors have described previously, was used in 53 patients with recurrent rectal cancer--47 patients for curative intent and 6 for palliation. Previous surgeries were abdominal perineal resections (APRs) in 26 patients, anterior resections in 19 patients, and other procedures in 2 patients; original primary Dukes' stage was B in 52% and C in 48%. Almost all patients had been irradiated previously, generally in the 4000 to 5900 cGy range. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (before ABSR) were elevated (> 5 ng/mL) in 54%. Postoperative morbidity was encountered in most patients. Mortality was 8.5% in the curative group. Long-term survival for 4 years was achieved in 14 of 43 patients (33%), and 10 patients were alive with an acceptable quality of life after 5 years. Patients who had previous anterior resections or whose preoperative CEA levels were less than 10 ng/mL had a survival rate of approximately 45%, whereas patients with previous APRs and preoperative CEA levels greater than 10 ng/mL had a survival rate of only 15% to 18%. Patients with bone marrow invasion, positive margins, or pelvic node metastases had a median survival of only 10 months. Pelvic recurrence of rectal cancer can be resected safely with expectation of long-term survival of 33%. Patient selection based on known risk factors can identify patients most likely to benefit from resection and eliminate those who should be treated for palliation only."}

Immunohistochemical carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) staining patterns at the invasive tumor margin were correlated with malignant potential in 64 advanced colorectal carcinomas. Twenty-two (34%) carcinomas showed an apical and 42 (66%) a cytoplasmic staining pattern. Carcinomas with a cytoplasmic pattern had a higher incidence of lymph node (71 versus 41%; p < 0.05) and liver (50 versus 23%; p < 0.05) metastasis and higher levels of serum CEA (p < 0.01) than those with an apical staining pattern. Nine of 11 recurrent tumors had a cytoplasmic pattern and 2 had an apical pattern (p < 0.05). Among carcinomas having the same degree of differentiation, those with a cytoplasmic CEA staining pattern were more aggressive. Six (55%) well-differentiated carcinomas with a cytoplasmic pattern metastasized to the liver while none with an apical pattern did (p < 0.05). Moderately differentiated carcinomas with a cytoplasmic pattern had a significantly higher incidence of lymph node metastasis than those with an apical pattern (77 versus 46%; p < 0.05). When colorectal carcinomas are examined at the invasive tumor margin, an evaluation of the CEA staining pattern is useful in recognizing carcinomas having a higher potential to metastasize and recur after curative surgery."}

To establish a sensitive assay for the specific detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing tumor cells in the bone marrow of patients with colorectal cancer and other CEA-positive carcinomas. A CEA-specific nested reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed and optimized using limiting dilutions of a CEA-positive cancer cell line mixed with normal bone marrow cell specimens. The optimized test was then used to examine bone marrow samples obtained from 15 patients with abdominal carcinomas (colorectal, n = 10; pancreatic, n = 3; gastric, n = 2) and six patients with breast cancer. Specificity was assessed by examination of 56 negative controls (malignant hematologic disease, n = 28; nonmalignant disease conditions, n = 5; healthy bone marrow donors, n = 8; normal peripheral-blood samples, n = 15). For 11 patients with abdominal carcinomas, immunostaining evaluations were performed using an anti-CEA and an anticytokeratin antibody, and the results compared with the nested PCR assay. In the sensitivity calibration system, single CEA-expressing tumor cells were detected in 2 to 5 x 10(7) normal bone marrow cells. All 56 control samples failed to amplify. This demonstrates that mRNAs coding for highly homologous CEA-related antigens expressed by various lineages of blood cells do not interfere. Bone marrow samples from 10 of 15 patients with abdominal cancers and four of six breast cancer patients scored positive, indicating micrometastatic bone disease. Four of 11 samples from the gastrointestinal cancer patients were found to be positive by the PCR method, but were negative with the immunocytology method. Since approximately 30% of the colorectal carcinoma patients that score negative in immunocytology staining of bone marrow samples have been reported to relapse, earlier diagnosis of the presence of malignant cells is needed. Our result that samples scoring positive in the described CEA-specific PCR test remained negative by two immunostaining methods suggests a higher sensitivity. We conclude that PCR amplification of CEA mRNA may lead to an earlier diagnosis of micrometastatic bone disease in patients with CEA-expressing carcinomas."}

In this phase III study, patients who had previously undergone surgery for colorectal cancer were studied using a technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled anti CEA antibody (IMMU-4 [Immunomedics, Morris Plains, NJ] 1mg of protein) to evaluate recurrence. Total-body, planar, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were performed within 6 hours of injection. Objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of the 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA antibody, to assess sensitivity and specificity of the agent in known lesions, and to detect occult disease. The impact of antibody study on subsequent surgery was also evaluated. The Fab' fragment has a molecular weight of 54,000 and is supplied as a lyophilized kit that can be instantaneously labeled with 20 to 30 mCi of [99mTc]pertechnetate. In 9 patients with known disease, planar spot imaging identified lesions in 7 (78% sensitivity), SPECT imaging detected lesions in 8 (88% sensitivity), and 1 patient did not have SPECT. In the group of 10 patients with occult (or equivocal) disease, planar imaging sensitivity was 50%, and SPECT sensitivity was 100%. Analysis by site showed 14 of 24 lesions detected by planar imaging (58% sensitivity), and SPECT detected 24 of 24 lesions (100% sensitivity). Tumors as small as .5 cm were visualized in the 19 patients studied.

Recurrent colorectal cancer is seen in as many as 40% of patients after curative resection. In view of the limitations of endoscopic and cross-sectional imaging, external immunoscintigraphy has been added to the follow-up regimen of patients at high-risk of recurrent disease. The authors investigated the utility of immunoscintigraphy with Indium-111 (In-111) CYT-103 (site specifically labeled conjugate of monoclonal antibody B72.3) in 19 patients with suspected recurrences after previous curative resection of colorectal carcinoma. Local or regional recurrences (4 patients) and liver metastasis (6 patients) were indicated by physical examination and computed tomography (CT), whereas nine patients had occult disease with increasing serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and negative conventional workups. Serum CEA levels were elevated (mean, 22 ng/ml) in all patients. Approximately 4.3 mCi In-111 labeled to 1.0 mg CYT-103 was administered intravenously to each patient. Planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging were performed 2-5 days after infusion. The final diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis was established in 18 patients by second-look surgery or biopsy. One patient died before exploration. Tumor was identified at the following locations: pelvis (12 patients), abdominal wall (2 patients), retroperitoneum (1 patient), liver (5 patients), and omentum (2 patients). Superiority of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) scan is noted in the detection of pelvic and intraabdominal recurrences (100%) versus CT scan (43%). Liver metastases were identified with equal facility by both modalities. In-111 CYT-103 scan findings influenced the management of 10 (55%) of 18 patients. Surgery was avoided in one patient with disseminated metastases detected by the scan. Correct identification of occult local recurrences was made in six patients. An isolated liver metastasis was confirmed in one patient with equivocal CT scan. Finally, additional intraabdominal lesions were detected in two patients. These results suggest an important and beneficial role for In-111 CYT-103 MoAb imaging in patients with suspected recurrent colorectal carcinomas, particularly in patients in whom cross-sectional imaging is negative; such imaging may prevent patients from undergoing unnecessary surgical exploration."}

Of the 31 patients with recurrent colorectal carcinomas, those with local recurrence showed the most prolonged CEA-DT, followed by those with lung, liver, and peritoneal metastases, respectively. A positive correlation was observed for gastric and colorectal carcinomas between CEA-DT in patients with metastatic lesions and outcome (R = 0.84 and 0.93, respectively). The results of the current study suggest that postoperative measurement of CEA-DT is useful in the determination of region of recurrence of carcinoma, which would permit early surgery and chemotherapy. Measurement of CEA-DT also may be helpful for the accurate determination of prognosis."}

This study investigated the effect of SMS 201.995 on CEA secretion of human colon cancer cell lines in vitro and as xenografts in nude mice. Using the two cell lines which secreted significant amounts of CEA in the media, there was a 40% and 54% decrease in CEA level at 2e-10M and 2e-9M concentrations of SMS 201.995, respectively, after five days of incubation for LIM 2412 cell line (P < 0.05, both). There was a 13% decrease in CEA at 2e-9M concentration of SMS with the LoVo cell line (P > 0.05). In vivo, there was a direct correlation between the mean volume of the LIM 2412 xenografts and serum CEA level (r = 0.92). When the growth of xenografts was inhibited by SMS, there was a corresponding drop in serum CEA. On the other hand, when tumor sizes remained unchanged, whether after a short duration of SMS treatment or with the oral route, serum CEA was unaffected. Thus, CEA concentration reflected cell number in vitro and tumor size in vivo as a response to treatment with SMS 201.995. The CEA level may therefore be a useful marker during somatostatin treatment to monitor tumor response."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a well-described human tumor-associated antigen most useful clinically in colon cancer. However, the clinical usefulness of CEA is limited by the marker's overall poor specificity and low sensitivity in patients with minimal disease. CA 195 is a recently discovered human tumor-associated glycoprotein that can be measured in serum using an immunoradiometric assay. CA 195 is expressed on the membrane of human colon cancer cells and shares an epitope with the Lewis A blood group antigens. The authors initiated a study to compare the clinical utility of serum CA 195 with CEA in patients with advanced cancer. A control population was studied to assess the effects of age, gender, alcohol, and tobacco on the measured levels of serum CA 195. Using a solid-phase two-site immunoradiometric assay, serum CA 195 and CEA levels were measured in 71 control subjects and 167 patients with a prior diagnosis of cancer. The tumor histologic types included breast cancer, 49 patients; colon cancer, 38; prostate cancer, 24; lung cancer, 22; gastrointestinal noncolon cancer, 7; and miscellaneous, 27. Among patients with a history of cancer, 124 (74%) had active metastatic disease, and 43 (26%) were without evidence of active disease. The control population was composed of subjects without a history of malignancy. Clinical data collected from them included age, gender, smoking history, and alcohol consumption. In this laboratory, the normal ranges established for CA 195 and CEA in the control group were: 0.0-8.3 U/ml and 0.2-4.2 ng/ml, respectively. In the control subjects, the serum CA 195 level, unlike that of CEA, was not affected by age, gender, alcohol consumption, or tobacco use. In the study population, CA 195 had either equivalent or inferior specificity and sensitivity to CEA in all tumor types. A determination of the additive specificity and sensitivity of CA 195 and CEA did not significantly improve its clinical utility compared with CEA alone. However, CA 195 was significantly elevated in three patients with a prior history of colon cancer thought to be without evidence of active disease. Because all three of these patients had a relapse within the next 1-15 months, CA 195 might identify early relapses of colon cancer in some patients. Based on these results, it was concluded that CA 195 is not superior to CEA as an indicator of disease activity in advanced colon cancer or other solid tumors. However, studies utilizing CA 195 in the detection of early relapses of colon cancer may be warranted. A review of the English literature revealed that CA 195 might be a useful marker in pancreatic cancer."}

Over a 10-year period, 166 patients underwent liver resection with curative intent for colorectal secondaries. These included 23 (13.8%) with metastases invading to adjacent organs.

Operative mortality was 4.3% (1/23 patients). Intraoperative findings and the pathologist's report led to the performance of R0 resection in 14 patients, and microscopic residual disease after R1 resection was found in 7 patients; in 2 cases macroscopically visible tumour had to be left behind. Median survival for all patients was 14 months and was significantly less favourable than in patients who had undergone resection of metastases confined to the liver (P = 0.011, long-rank test). The median recurrence-free interval was 6.8 months (P = 0.11). Obviously, patients who had undergone R0 resection and whose CEA serum levels returned to normal after operation benefited the most, and among these a median survival of 17 months was recorded. It is concluded that in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, invasion of the metastases to adjacent organs has significant implications for the prognosis, even if the metastases are resected. It is important to detect this situation preoperatively, to avoid subjecting patients to a treatment that offers little benefit."}

Records of 487 patients in long-term follow-up after Ro resection of colorectal carcinomas between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1989 were analyzed. Every patient underwent regular examinations according to a defined schedule after curative resection of colorectal carcinoma. The date of evaluation was June 31, 1991. During a median observation time of 48 months (range, 15-132 months), tumor recurrence was observed in 149 patients (30.6 percent), with 56.4 percent of these suffering from tumor-associated symptoms. As the primary manifestation of tumor recurrence, only distant metastases (DM) were found in 76 patients (51 percent), only local recurrence (LR) in 46 patients (30.9 percent), and both DM and LR in 27 patients (18.1 percent). Patients with rectal carcinoma developed LR more frequently (P < 0.05) (19.5 percent) than patients with colon carcinoma (11.8 percent). The probability of developing distant metastases was not different (P < 0.05) for colon or rectal carcinoma but depended on primary tumor stage (P < 0.05). Only 36 patients (24.2 percent) with recurrence could undergo further curative resection. Fifty patients (33.5 percent) were given palliative therapy, and 63 patients (42.3 percent) were given no oncologic treatment. Only 9 of the 36 patients (6 percent of all recurrence patients) undergoing Ro resection were free of tumor for more than two years. In no case was a third Ro resection possible. The survival time of these patients was increased significantly after Ro resection of tumor recurrence (P = 0.03).

If a malignant lesion was suspected, further appropriate tests were performed. After hospital discharge, periodic follow-up was performed on all patients in our outpatient clinic. A malignant lesion was detected in 9 of 78 patients: in 7 of them, cancer was diagnosed during the hospital admission because of acute PE. All but one of these 7 patients were asymptomatic, except for PE symptoms. In three of them some abnormalities on physical examination led to the diagnosis of cancer; in the remaining three patients the diagnosis was suspected from abnormal results of blood tests. Cancer was detected several months after hospital discharge in two additional patients: an esophageal cancer was diagnosed 5 months later in one of the 23 patients who refused endoscopy; and a colonic carcinoma was detected 21 months after hospital discharge in a patient in whom colonoscopy was not performed at the time of hospital admission. When considered overall, cancer was more commonly found in patients with \"idiopathic\" PE as compared with patients with known risk factors for PE development (6 of 21 patients vs 3 of 51 patients; p < 0.05). On the other hand, one patient died because of massive recurrent PE after a biopsy sample was obtained because of a prostatic node. Gross hematuria had developed shortly after biopsy, and any attempt to increase heparin doses was followed by recurrent hematuria.

The role of immunoscintigraphy in patients with colorectal cancer is being defined in ongoing clinical trials. Currently, most follow-up examination after \"curative\" resection of colorectal carcinoma are performed by surgeons, oncologists and gastroenterologists. They are largely focused on detecting recurrent intraluminal disease and measuring serial serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Although rising CEA is often indicative of nonresectable disease, some patients with elevated CEA levels have no evidence of recurrent disease using conventional diagnostic modalities. In these patients, immunoscintigraphy will probably have a major diagnostic role. In addition, immunoscintigraphy may become valuable in screening patients at high risk for recurrence postoperatively, such as those with Dukes' stage C lesions, aneuploidy, poor tumor differentiation or tumor adhesion to or invasion of adjacent organs. Immunoscintigraphy may allow earlier diagnosis of recurrent disease and permit more targeted follow-up studies. Intensive, timely follow-up of these patients should lead to early detection of recurrent disease at a time when these lesions are still resectable."}

Endoscopy and barium enema examinations are used to identify the primary site of disease in patients with clinical suspicion of colorectal cancer. Once colorectal cancer has been confirmed by imaging studies and biopsy, preoperative evaluation is directed toward accurate disease staging. Most currently available imaging techniques are inaccurate for detecting transmural extension, perienteric spread of tumors and distant lymph node involvement. Although both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have an unacceptably low sensitivity for accurate staging, CT is clearly superior to MRI for detecting extrahepatic metastases. Transrectal ultrasonography, however, is a promising new method for detecting perirectal spread of disease. The diagnostic efficacy of MRI and intravenous dynamic hepatic CT for detecting liver metastases is approximately equal. CT during arterial portography is recommended before resection of solitary liver metastases. Chest radiography is also part of the routine preoperative evaluation. Bone scans are rarely performed in patients without the skeletal pain suggestive of bone metastases. During the years following surgery for colorectal cancer, many patients undergo special imaging studies to identify local tumor recurrence, secondary tumor growth elsewhere within the large bowel and both regional and distant spread of disease. Thus, for the patient with a sharply increasing carcinoembryonic antigen level, CT of the abdomen and liver is the current recommendation. Immunoscintigraphy is a new imaging modality that addresses some of the limitations of current diagnostic procedures for colorectal cancer. This procedure gives whole body information on disease extent, especially in the extrahepatic abdomen and pelvis, and can therefore contribute to patient management decisions."}

In this study, we have investigated the effects of the same modality of administration of rIFN-alpha-2b in 62 patients with breast and colorectal cancer whose primary tumour was surgically removed 1 month before and who were without evidence of disease (NED) at the time of the study. A significant increase of 90K serum concentration was already observed 24 h after the first r-IFN-alpha-2b injection and persisted throughout the investigational period. The increase was more pronounced in patients with a basal 90K-negative than a 90K-positive assay. Of 54 patients who started the test with a 90K negative assay, 17 (31%) shifted to a positive assay after rIFN-alpha-2b. Twenty-eight of 62 (45%) patients exhibited a 90K value above the mean increment of the whole population. The serum levels of CEA, CA-15-3, CA 19-9, and alpha-fetoprotein measured in the same serum samples were not modified. After 2 years of follow-up, ten patients relapsed. Six of them showed a 90K increase above the mean increment of the whole population. As with ovarian cancer, the increase of 90K following r-IFN-alpha-2b administration might be of importance for the early detection of disease recurrence in clinically NED breast and colon cancer patients."}

Similar trends in serial CEA and CA19-9 levels were found. While CEA is more sensitive for the detection of colorectal carcinomas than the other two markers, ST439 is sensitive in the detection of localized carcinomas and recurrent cases with localized lesions or liver metastasis.

The three major indications for the study are: 1) occult disease--unexplained rise in serum tumor markers (e.g. CEA), with negative work-up including CT; 2) known local recurrence (e.g. liver or rectal area)--surgery is planned, but there is a need to rule out other areas of involvement; 3) clarify equivocal CT or MRI finding--to distinguish whether an abnormality is due to recurrent tumor or scar tissue, fibrosis, or unopacified bowel loop. Oncoscint has proven to be more sensitive than CT in the detection of disease in the pelvis and extrahepatic abdomen. CT remains the modality of choice for the detection of liver metastases. The combined sensitivity of the two modalities is 88% on a per-patient basis."}

Response of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TAE) and transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy to hepatic metastases was reported in 25 cases of colorectal cancer. The severity of liver metastases was H1 in 12 cases, H2 in 9 cases, and H3 in 4 cases. Liver metastases were found during surgery in 12 of these patients, and 13 showed metastases or recurrence in the liver after resections of primary lesions. Catheters were inserted selectively to the proper hepatic artery by Seldinger's method, followed by injection of embolizing agents (gelfoam particles of Lipiodol) with adriamycin or 5-FU + leucovorin in most cases. Response was assessed by blood CEA levels, diagnostic imaging, and period of survival. In 5 cases in whom liver resections were performed following TAE, response was assessed by histopathological findings of the resected specimens. Two patients showed partial response (PR), 12 no change (NC) and 11 progressive disease (PD) by diagnostic imaging. Blood CEA levels fell to less than 50% of pre-treatment levels in 26% of cases. Histological changes by TAE were confirmed in 4 of 5 cases after liver resections, but viable cancer cells were observed in all cases. A case of mucinous cancer showed no change histologically. As the other case of mucinous cancer showed PD by diagnostic imaging, TAE was not suggested to be suitable to treat cases of mucinous cancer. More improvements in the dosage, drugs and times of treatment were suggested to yield a better response rate in TAE therapy for liver metastases from colorectal cancer."}

Experience with ZCE-025 and IMMU-4 monoclonal antibodies and proposed directions for clinical trials. In an effort to identify the site of recurrent colorectal cancer in patients with occult metastasis and increasing serum CEA levels, we conducted two trials using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against CEA. The first utilized Indium-111-labeled ZCE-025; an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anticarcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) antibody (Hybritech, San Diego, CA). The second study used Tc-99m-labeled Fab' fragment of IMMU-4 (Immunomedics, Morris Plains, NJ). Eighteen patients were imaged with the ZCE-025 and 14 with the Tc-99m Fab' IMMU-4. True-positive scans, defined as at least one correct correlation of the MoAb scan and surgical/histologic findings, were observed in 12 of 15 patients undergoing exploration or biopsy using the ZCE-025 and 11 of 14 using the IMMU-4. There were no true-negative scans with the ZCE-025 and only 2 of 14 with the IMMU-4. There were 3 false-positive scans with the ZCE-025 and 1 of 14 with IMMU-4. There were no false-negative scans with either ZCE-025 or IMMU-4. Four (31%) of 13 patients undergoing exploration and imaged with ZCE-025 and 5 (36%) of 14 imaged with IMMU-4 had complete tumor resection. Treatment decisions were affected in 3 (16%) of 18 ZCE-025-imaged patients and 3 (21%) of 14 IMMU-4 ones. Two (14%) of 14 patients imaged with IMMU-4 had negative MoAb scans and negative laparotomies. Despite these findings, it is not known whether such early detection and resection will translate into improved survival rates. The authors suggest two randomized studies, one designed to ascertain the role of MoAb added to blind exploratory laparotomy. In that study, patients with increasing CEA levels and a negative workup will be randomized to an exploratory laparotomy preceded by MoAb anti-CEA scans or a straight exploratory laparotomy without the assistance of a MoAb anti-CEA scan. Endpoints will be differences in complete resectability and survival. A second study will examine the merits of blind exploratory laparotomies. In that study, patients with increasing CEA levels and a negative workup would be randomized to MoAb imaging, exploratory laparotomy, and radioimmunoguided surgery, and the other cohort of patients would continue to have conventional radiologic workup. Exploration in this latter group would be performed only when indicated by radiologic or endoscopic studies. The endpoint of the study would compare survival in the two cohorts of patients. These two studies may ultimately settle the debate regarding the correct approach to patients with occult metastatic colorectal cancer and a increasing levels of serum CEA."}

The reported low resectability rate for patients with recurrent colorectal cancer who have carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels > 11 has led us to perform this study. One hundred twenty-four patients who underwent Radioimmunoguided Surgery (RIGS) procedures for recurrent colorectal cancer from 1986 to the present were studied. In surgery, all patients underwent a traditional exploration followed by survey with a hand-held, gamma-detecting probe to detect preinjected radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies attached to cancer cells. Sites of metastases included: 72 liver (58.1 percent), 23 pelvis (18.5 percent), 15 distant lymph nodes (12.1 percent), 2 anastomotic (1.6 percent), and 12 other sites (9.7 percent). The resectability rate was 43.5 percent (54 patients). The mean preoperative CEA level for patients with resectable disease was significantly lower than for patients with unresectable disease (P = 0.017): unresectable--mean, 87.1; SD, 141.0; minimum, 0.3; maximum, 501; resectable--mean, 36.6; SD, 59.3; minimum, 0.3; maximum, 329. The CEA level for patients with liver metastasis did not vary significantly from those patients without metastasis: 70 vs. 58.2 (P = 0.58). Those patients with resectable liver tumors had lower mean CEA levels than those with unresectable liver, approaching significance: 41.6 vs. 91.9 (P = 0.065). Other metastatic sites had a mean CEA level of: pelvic, 72.6; distant lymph nodes, 47.8; anastomotic, 2.7; and other sites, 53.8. These data suggest that there is a significant difference between the preoperative CEA level of the resectable and unresectable recurrent colorectal cancer patients, but the large standard deviation does not justify abandonment of exploration for any CEA level."}

Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most frequently chosen tumor marker in the clinical diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma and in the long-term monitoring of patients after tumor resection. In recent years, monoclonal antibody technology has identified several new markers of neoplasia, two of which, TAG-72 and CA 19-9, are found in the sera of patients with adenocarcinoma. Serum CEA, TAG-72, and CA 19-9 were evaluated in 300 patients with either malignant (n = 200) or benign (n = 100) colorectal disease. Serum CEA, TAG-72 (CA 72-4), and CA 19-9 antigen levels were determined with a double-determinant radioimmunometric assay kit. Samples and appropriate standards were assayed in duplicate. The cutoff limits used for each assay were indicated by the manufacturer. All of the results of the CA 72-4, CEA, and CA 19-9 serum assays were separated from the clinical information until the study was completed. Of the 200 patients with colorectal carcinoma, the percentage of patients whose serum samples were positive for CEA, TAG-72, or CA 19-9 was 43%, 43%, and 27%, respectively. The measurement of TAG-72 with CEA for patients with primary or recurrent colorectal carcinoma increased substantially (to 60%) the percentage of positive serum samples when compared with measuring each serum tumor marker alone. Moreover, the apparent advantage gained by measuring the two tumor markers was achieved with little increase in the number of false-positive results. The findings support previous observations of complementary expression of TAG-72 and CEA and indicate that a significant advantage could be gained in the detection of primary and, perhaps, recurrent colorectal carcinoma by incorporating the measurement of serum TAG-72 with that of CEA."}

Forty-fold dilution by normal human sera was necessary to measure CEA levels of gallbladder bile by the enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Bile CEA levels were 27.2 +/- 30.4 (M +/- SD) ng/ml in patients with benign biliary diseases (control), 248.5 +/- 426.3 ng/ml (p < 0.05, vs. control) in Dukes B, C patients, and 3,331.5 +/- 4,473.3 ng/ml (p < 0.01 vs. control, p < 0.05 vs. Dukes B, C) in patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, respectively. Bile CEA tended to demonstrate the existence of hepatic metastases more accurately than serum CEA.

Of 26 fine-needle aspirates, 20 were malignant and 6 benign. Final results were correlated with pathologic examination (when available), clinical review, and follow-up. Three patients had an abscess associated with perforated, recurrent carcinoma, of whom only one had cytologic assessment prior to drainage. The sensitivity of fine-needle aspiration was 85%, and for adenocarcinoma alone, 80%.

In colorectal cancer, immunoscintigraphy can be beneficial to the surgeon. With primary colorectal carcinoma, IS detects synchronous primaries, identifies lymph node metastasis, determines extent of disease and detects occult metastasis. Postoperatively, in high-risk patients (Dukes B2, B3 and C lesions) IS assists in the follow-up for recurrence. Particular advantage with IS is seen in pelvic, mesenteric and retroperitoneal recurrences.

Local tumor recurrence rates after curative rectal cancer surgery are reportedly high and herald a poor diagnosis. Extramural recurrence is most common and is due to the failure to remove all of the tumor during the initial operation. In the rarer anastomotic recurrence, the implantation of exfoliated malignant cells is possible, but histochemical changes in the mucosa surrounding a tumor may be considered as an alternative cause of local recurrence. Local recurrence rates did not improve when the distal margins were extended over 2 cm, but microscopic lateral tumor extension appears to be the major determinant of recurrence. Early diagnosis is based on frequent CEA assays, history, physical examination, endoscopy, endoluminal ultrasound and pelvic CT scan. Aggressive treatment involving a combination of field irradiation, surgical debulking and intra-operative radiation can result in local control and long-term survival in 10 to 25% of patients."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen testing was most sensitive for hepatic or retroperitoneal metastasis and relatively insensitive for local, pulmonary, or peritoneal involvement. Surgical explorations were performed in 115 patients with CEA elevations, and 47 recurrences, usually hepatic, were resected with curative intent. On the other hand, 38 patients with normal CEA concentrations and 23 patients not monitored also underwent such resections--usually for pulmonary or local recurrence. Of all CEA-monitored patients, 2.3% are alive and disease free more than 1 year after salvage surgery (2.9% of those with CEA elevations and 1.9% of those with no elevations). Of patients with no CEA monitoring, 2.0% are also alive and disease free more than 1 year after salvage surgery. Cancer cures attributable to CEA monitoring are, at best, infrequent. It is questionable whether this small gain justifies the substantial cost in dollars and physical and emotional stress that this intervention may cause for patients."}

Increases in mdr-1 RNA were observed within 8 h of the addition of the Pgp antagonists and continued to rise over time. Peak levels were attained after several weeks and were sustained for the duration of treatment up to several months, with a rapid decline in mdr-1 mRNA levels after removal of the Pgp antagonist. Corresponding changes in Pgp were demonstrated with addition and removal of the Pgp antagonists. Increased mdr-1 mRNA was also seen with two other calcium channel blockers, nicardipine and diltiazem, but not with the Pgp antagonists, quinidine and chlorpromazine. Treatment with verapamil or nifedipine was associated with electron microscopic changes consistent with increased differentiation and resulted in increased carcinoembryonic antigen expression, suggesting that the increase in mdr-1 expression was associated with the process of differentiation. Nuclear runoff experiments and inhibition of new RNA synthesis with actinomycin D treatment failed to detect an increase in mdr-1 transcription or stabilization of the mdr-1 mRNA suggesting that the effect of these agents is mediated posttranscriptionally within the nucleus."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), one of the most clinically important tumor markers, is mainly used in the post-surgical surveillance of patients with colorectal carcinomas. CEA belongs to a large protein family, which includes cross-reacting antigens, e.g., non-specific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs) and biliary glycoprotein (BGP) as well as pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs). The genes encoding these proteins can be subdivided into the CEA and PSG subgroups. The members of the subgroups share antigenic determinants and show high similarity in amino-acid sequences. Their derived secondary structures show them to belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Due to the close relationship of the members of the CEA subgroup, it is very difficult to distinguish between the individual members with MAbs. Here we have used flow cytometric analysis of transfectants expressing individual members of the CEA subgroup as an alternative approach to determine the specificities of 13 MAbs. This allows us to examine the specificities of these antibodies for members of the CEA family, even of those which have not yet been characterized at the protein level. In addition, binding of the MAbs to NCAs expressed by polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) was tested by Western-blot analysis, immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry. Four antibodies bound exclusively to NCA-50/90 and one MAb (80H3) only to NCA-95. MAb 4/3/17 recognizes CEA and BGP on the surface of transfectants and NCA-160 from granulocytes. We assume that NCA-160 is a product of the BGP gene. On granulocytes, which do not express CEA, MAb 4/3/17 is specific for NCA-160 (BGP). Mutual inhibition of the MAbs binding to NCA-50/90 revealed 3 different epitope groups."}

We did not find any correlation between the level of positivity of the markers and the clinical parameters we examined. When serial determinations were carried out, CEA showed the best indication of response to treatment, followed by CA 19.9. In the evaluation of the response to chemotherapy we found that CA 125 presented significant percentages of false-positive (9%) (P < 0.008) and false-negative (8.1%) (P < 0.008) results, compared to CEA and CA 19.9. CA 125 did not demonstrate any utility for the follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer although increased values were found in 37%.

A number of clinical and pathological characteristics were prospectively collected and recorded. In addition, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was measured within 1 week before surgery. The endpoint used was recurrence below the level of the umbilicus. All patients were followed for at least 5 years or until time of death. The two Dukes' stages B and C were analysed in two separate analyses using the Cox proportional hazards model. In patients with Dukes' B tumours, an increased risk of loco-regional recurrence was associated with perineural invasion, tumour located less than 10 cm from the anal verge, patient aged above 70 years, and small tumour size. In patients with Dukes' C tumours, the necessity to resect neighbour organs, perineural and venous invasion, tumour located less than 10 cm from the anal verge, and large tumour size were all associated with a poor loco-regional outcome. Postoperative radiotherapy was not a significant prognosticator for loco-regional control. An update of the 5-year results of the randomised study of post-operative radiotherapy (50 Gy with 2 Gy per fraction in an overall treatment time of 7 weeks) showed no survival benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy in either Dukes' category and no statistically significant improvement in the 5-year loco-regional control rate. However, when the comparison was restricted to a group of high-risk patients there was a statistically significant benefit from radiotherapy with respect to loco-regional control (P = 0.03) but not with respect to survival (P = 0.23). The potential advantage, in terms of the required number of patients, of restricting clinical trials of intensified loco-regional therapies to the high-risk patients, is illustrated."}

From the surgical point of view it may be helpful to adopt the following guidelines in the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal cancer: 1. A gastroenterologist concerned with oncological patients should initiate adequate resectional treatment of the primary tumor. 2. In case of locoregional recurrences, every diagnostic effort (endoscopy, intraluminal ultrasound, angiogram, CT-scan, MRI) should be made to select patients with limited and resectable disease. 3. In patients with liver metastases amenable to surgical resection it is mandatory to rule out extrahepatic disease preoperatively as far as possible. 4. Prognostic factors deriving from tumor-biological data, extent of recurrent disease, and laboratory findings (CEA) must be taken into consideration when the decision whether to operate is to be made. These arguments should also be used to support non-operative treatment in patients with a type of recurrence that cannot be cured by surgery. 5. Postoperatively, all information (intraoperatively detected extrahepatic disease, tumor infiltrated resection margins, CEA not returning to normal levels) should be combined to classify patients according to whether they carry a high risk for a second tumor recurrence and should thus undergo additional treatment. In a \"low-risk situation\", further follow-up seems to be adequate."}

The aim of our study was the estimation of the method's sensitivity and specificity under different aspects to find out for which indications and questions the 99mTc-RIS is useful. Colorectal primary tumours in 19 patients were scintigraphically detected with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 100%; 3 out of 7 other tumour sites were localised correctly. 55 patients were examined during the follow-up of colorectal cancer. There were 17 out of 22 true positive findings of local recurrences (sensitivity 77%, specificity 88%). Liver metastases were imaged as hot lesions with only 41% sensitivity and 86% specificity. The detection of extrahepatic tumour sites is difficult because of the persistently high blood-pool activity of the monoclonal antibody and, in the pelvic area, the unspecific bowel activity. Skeletal metastases were recognised in 7 out of 9 cases. In 14 patients with other non-colorectal carcinomas, RIS was successful in single cases. It is not helpful, however, when searching for tumours of unknown origin or for the screening of patients with elevated CEA levels without tumour history. The high technical, methodological and time effort required by RIS is justified in the follow-up of cancer patients when conventional diagnostic procedures are inconclusive or the status of morphological findings remains unclear. The use of RIS as an unspecific screening tool in tumour diagnosis must be rejected because of the not completely explored risks of the examination. Repeated applications of monoclonal antibodies require controls of the patients' HAMA titers before performing RIS."}

The sensitivity of 111In-CYT-103 imaging was slightly lower when interpreted retrospectively by the blinded readers in the absence of any patient-specific information. 111In-CYT-103 imaging sensitivity was similar in patients with primary and recurrent disease, but lower for liver metastases than for extrahepatic disease. Thirty-three previously unknown lesions were visualized by immunoscintigraphy; tissue confirmation was available for only five lesions, and all were found to be free of tumor. Only one of the lesions evaluated was TAG-72 positive. Twenty-eight lesions were outside the surgical field or not biopsied. Although no tissue confirmation was available, seven (25%) of these lesions were identified as consistent with metastatic disease by other conventional modalities. Importantly, antibody scans detected occult tumor lesions in 11 of the 92 patients with surgically confirmed adenocarcinoma, and accurately diagnosed 7 of 10 patients with elevated serum CEA levels and negative conventional workup. Surgery confirmed the presence of tumor identified only by 111In-CYT-103 in three patients, while four patients with negative scans had no evidence of recurrent disease at surgery. Antibody scans confirmed the absence of additional disease in 18 of 22 patients with isolated hepatic or pelvic recurrences in whom curative surgery was contemplated. The results of this multicenter trial suggest that CYT-103 immunoscintigraphy can provide information that is complementary to that derived from standard diagnostic techniques.

Careful patient selection for hepatic resection of colorectal cancer metastases is essential to improve current poor results. Carcinoembryonic antigen level and number of metastases were significant preoperative prognostic indicators of 5-year disease-free survival in patients selected clinically for hepatic surgery. Surgical margin, weight of hepatic tissue resected, carcinoembryonic antigen level, and flow cytometry were significant postoperative prognostic indicators. Patients with a carcinoembryonic antigen level less than 200 ng/mL, 1-cm surgical margins, and less than 1,000 g of liver tissue removed had a greater than 50% estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate. If the metastases were diploid on flow cytometry, an additional survival advantage may have been gained. Inadequate surgical margins led to high rates of liver-only recurrence. Nonhepatic recurrence was unrelated to surgical margins. Intraoperative liver examination by ultrasound during primary colon cancer resection and adjuvant chemotherapy may offer earlier selection of biologically appropriate patients and improved outcome; both recommendations require clinical trials."}

In order to evaluate the response to radiotherapy symptomatic relief, CEA levels, decrease of tumor volume measured by CT analysis were correlated with the FDG-uptake. The objective of this study was also to investigate if the level of FDG-uptake prior to radiotherapy or the early decrease after therapy can be used as a prognostic factor. Prior to radiotherapy sacral pain was the predominant symptom. All malignancies showed measurable tumor masses, evaluation of CEA levels and enhanced tracer accumulation of FDG in the PET cross section. The mean FDG-uptake before radiotherapy was 2.3 +/- 1.1 (range 1.1 to 5.0) in 21 patients in contrast to 1.9 +/- 0.7 (range 0.8 bis 4.0) three months after radiotherapy. In six patients FDG concentration values decreased to the range of normal soft tissue, moreover, two of them relapsed after six and 22 months. Elevated FDG-uptake of the sacral bone was noted in PET cross sections in two patients, while there was no evidence of osseous alterations in CT. Normal levels of CEA were achieved in 14 patients and complete or partial pain relief in 20 of 21 patients. A decrease of tumor volume of more than 50% was detected in the follow-up CT scans of three patients but no complete remission was found. The result suggests that enhanced glucose uptake is associated with recurrent rectal cancer. However, enhanced glycolytic activity is related not only to malignant cells but also to all proliferating cells. To distinguish between proliferation, repair, inflammation, and residual viable tumor cells is not possible and may be responsible for an unchanged or elevated FDG-uptake after radiotherapy."}

Combining the volume rendering and bicolour visualization techniques is proposed as an aid in interpreting single photon emission tomography (SPET) immunoscintigraphy (IS) recorded simultaneously with SPET bone landmarking (BL). The combination helps in localizing abnormal monoclonal uptake and in differentiating it from a physiological radioactivity distribution. The so-called rendered images (RIs) are obtained in both IS and BL studies according to a depth- weighted maximum activity projection algorithm. Fused BL and IS RIs are constructed by a simple, pixel by pixel addition. They are displayed using a bicolour grey-red scale, which makes it possible to visualize both studies by a transparency effect. This method was applied to patients suspected of suffering colorectal or ovarian cancer recurrences, in whom monoclonal antibodies against carcinoembryonic antigen, B72-3 or OC125 labelled with indium-111 were used."}

A method of superimposing computed tomography (CT) and immunoscintigraphic (IS) single photon emission tomography (SPET) slices is presented and has been applied to 10 patients with suspected cancer recurrence. IS was performed with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-specific indium-111 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in 5 patients with colorectal cancer, and with OC125 111In-MoAbs in 5 patients with ovarian cancer. All patients had an abnormal CT image result in the pelvis, which was interpreted 5 times as recurrence, once as doubtful and four times as scar fibrosis. Recurrence was subsequently proven in all patients. Bone scintigraphy (BS) SPET was recorded at the same time as IS. No special technique was used during BS, IS or CT acquisition. CT images were fed into a computer using a CCD camera. Using the internal anatomical landmarks provided by the pelvic bone structures seen on CT and BS, an operator had to select corresponding fiducial points, which were used by the software to register the images. The final results were CT-BS and CT-IS superimposed images. CT-BS images were used for quality control. In all patients, the inspection of CT-BS and CT-IS showed that the registration process is accurate and assists in the co-interpretation of CT and IS images."}

Between 1960 and 1988, 139 consecutive patients underwent pulmonary resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Median interval between colon resection and lung resection was 34 months. Ninety-eight patients (70.5%) had a solitary metastasis. Wedge excision was performed in 68 patients, lobectomy in 53, lobectomy plus wedge excision in 9, bilobectomy in 4, and pneumonectomy in 5. Operative mortality was 1.4%. Localized extrapulmonary colorectal cancer was also resected in 20 patients. Median follow-up was 7 years (range 1 to 20.4 years). Overall 5- and 20-year survival was 30.5% and 16.2%, respectively. Five-year survival for patients with solitary metastasis was 36.9%, as compared with 19.3% for those with two metastases (p less than 0.05) and 7.7% for those with more than two (p less than 0.01). Patients with normal carcino-embryonic antigen had a 5-year survival of 46.8% versus 16.0% for patients with increased levels (p less than 0.01). Five-year survival for patients with resected extrapulmonary disease was 30.0% versus 30.7% for those without extrapulmonary cancer (p = not significant). Repeat thoracotomy for recurrent metastases was done in 19 patients. Five-year survival after the second lung resection was 30.2%. We conclude that resection of colorectal lung metastases is safe and effective, that resectable extrapulmonary disease does not necessarily contraindicate pulmonary resection, and that repeat thoracotomy is warranted in selected patients with recurrent colorectal lung metastases."}

Sixty-six consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for rectal cancer were studied prospectively to evaluate the roles of sequential carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and carcinomatous antigen 19-9 (Ca 19-9) determinations in the early diagnosis of resectable recurrences. Thirty-three recurrences were detected between 6 and 42 months. CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 72.7 percent, 78.8 percent, and 60.1 percent, respectively, and a specificity of 60.6 percent, 60.6 percent, and 87.9 percent, respectively. In 23 cases the rise in the value of CEA and/or TPA and/or Ca 19-9 was the first sign of recurrences, and the diagnosis was established later by clinical methods. In this group, the lead time was two months for liver metastases and four months for disseminated metastases. As far as the relationship between localization of recurrence and marker level increase is concerned, of 16 hepatic metastases CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 94 percent (P less than 0.05), 69 percent, and 62 percent, respectively. Of six patients with local recurrences, CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 50 percent, 100 percent (P less than 0.05), and 83.3 percent, respectively. Of three patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, CEA, TPA (P less than 0.05), and Ca 19-9 showed a sensitivity of 0 percent, 100 percent, and 0 percent, respectively. No significant differences were reported among the three markers according to multiple metastases and metachronous polyps. Fourteen patients (42.4 percent) underwent surgical treatment for recurrent disease, and eight of them (57 percent) showed a resectable disease, for a total resectability rate of 24.2 percent. The findings of our study indicate that a follow-up program based on CEA, TPA, and Ca 19-9 assays is related to an early diagnosis and a good resectability rate for both local and metastatic recurrences from rectal cancer."}

This can be especially important in preoperative planning for cases in which resection may be curative. In addition, an understanding of the distribution of nodal metastasis will make it possible to recognize early recurrent nodal disease, particularly with an increase in associated increase in levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, and to predict certain clinical sequences such as hydronephrosis of the left kidney associated with left colic nodal metastases."}

In this series, 355 patients underwent potentially curative surgery for primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. A close surveillance program of follow-up revealed 108 patients (30%) who had a serum elevation in CEA and/or LDH-K. The patients were divided into three groups.

Results of surgical treatment of recurrences were classified peroperatively as radical when no residual tumour was apparent and resection margins were free of disease. In total, 18 (78%) patients had increased secretory component during the whole follow up period (median 16 months); 12 (52%) had raised secretory component concentrations before clinical recurrence (median lead time 5.2 months). There was no difference before recurrence between circulating secretory component and CEA in sensitivity and lead times. Seventeen patients underwent surgery for hepatic metastasis; seven had radical hepatic resection of which only two (29%) showed increased secretory component concentrations before clinical recurrence; both had concurrent raised CEA values. By contrast, secretory component was raised in 83% of those cases considered inoperable. Although serum secretory component clearly increases in most patients with liver metastases, its clinical value seems questionable because secretory component apparently indicates mainly inoperable hepatic metastases."}

Monitoring patients after primary large bowel surgery for malignancy is predicated on the concept that early detection of recurrence may provide salvage treatment for cure. Knowledge of the pathologic site and stage provides important information as to the probability of recurrence and the patterns of failure that are likely to occur. Available methods to detect recurrence include clinical, roentgenographic, and serum tests that are done more frequently during the first 2 years after surgery. Monitoring plasma carcinoembryonic antigen levels can lead to identification of asymptomatic recurrences, but there is controversy about the curability of recurrences outside the liver. Newer techniques (such as computed tomographic portography, intraoperative ultrasonography, and radioimmunoguided surgery) provide greater diagnostic accuracy and lead to more appropriate procedures during \"second-look\" operations. For example, hepatic resection in properly selected patients offers up to a 30% chance of cure and should be pursued aggressively. A search for metachronous cancers by endoscopy also should be done. Knowledge of the potential and patterns of failure can provide a useful guide during the postoperative follow-up care of the patient with large bowel cancer."}

The positivity rate was high for all four markers in stage V cases among 86 cases of colorectal cancer, and in cases of non resectable cancer and cases of recurrence. The highest positive rate was obtained with CEA. On the contrary, in cases of stage I to IV the positivity rates of these four tumor markers were as low as 0 to 34.8%. Out of 127 cases of colorectal cancer excluded of 43 NED cases, 52 cases were negative for all four tumor markers and 14 cases were positive only for CEA. In 49 cases, CEA and at least one of the other three tumor markers gave positive results. In 12 cases, CEA gave negative results and at least one of the other three tumor markers positive results. In conclusion, measurement of blood levels of these tumor markers is limited of its usefulness in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, in the diagnosis of advanced stage and of recurrence during the postoperative follow-up period the measurement of tumor markers provides useful information. CEA is most sensitive among the four tumor markers tested and any combination of these four markers is not advantageous because of an increase in false positivity rate."}

Control mice received either 131I F(ab')2 alone, 5FU alone or no treatment. RIT alone induced significant tumor regression, while 5FU alone gave only minimal tumor growth inhibition. The combined treatment group also resulted in long-term tumor regression with tumors remaining significantly smaller than in the RIT alone group. There was however, no significant difference in tumor recurrence time between the groups treated with RIT alone or with RIT + 5FU. Myelotoxicity, the major side effect of RIT, detected by the decrease of peripheral white blood cells (WBC), was shown to be almost identical between the groups receiving only RIT or only 5FU. Surprisingly, there was no cumulative bone marrow toxicity in animals which received 5FU before RIT. Furthermore, in the latter group, the WBC levels after RIT were significantly higher than in the control group receiving only RIT. Taken together, the results demonstrate the higher therapeutic efficiency of RIT as compared to 5FU in this model. They do not show, however, that the combination of the two forms of treatment can induce longer tumor remission. Interestingly, the WBC results suggest that 5FU given before RIT can have a radioprotective effect on bone marrow, possibly by selecting radioresistant bone marrow stem cells."}

TAA are generally used in gastrointestinal carcinomas by 98.5% and 92.6% of internists (i) and surgeons (s), respectively. Preoperatively, serum concentrations of TAA are determined in 63.9% (i) and 84% (s) of gastric carcinomas. The corresponding rates in colorectal carcinomas are 93.8% and 92.6%. TAA are a routine part of postoperative care in 68.8% (i) and 76% (s) of gastric and in 100% (i) and 96.2% (s) of colorectal cancers. Interest is almost exclusively focused on CEA and CA 19-9. Other tumor associated antigens are rarely investigated in these diseases. Increasing serum concentrations of TAA induce intensive diagnostic procedures in 82.4% and 95.7% of internists and surgeons. However, an indication for a second-look operation solely based on increasing TAA concentrations is only seen by 30.6% of internists and 37% of surgeons.

To evaluate the role of folinic acid (FA) in circumvence resistance in colorectal cancer, 28 patients pretreated with fluoropyrimidine were candidated to receive one of the following schedules: fluorouracil (600 mg/m2) associated with FA (500 mg/m2) weekly for 6 weeks (Regimen A: 21 cases), or fluorouracil (370 mg/m2) plus FA (200 mg/m2) daily for 5 days every 4 weeks (Regimen B: 7 cases). Fourteen patients were pretreated with doxifluridine, a new fluoropyrimidine derivative with a peculiar mechanism of action, and the remaining 14 patients with fluorouracil. All but 2 patients were unresponsive to first-line treatments. When the treatment began, the median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 30-68). The performance status (ECOG) was 0/1 in 25 of them, and the primary tumor was in the colon and rectum in 19 and 9 patients, respectively. Sites of disease were liver (64%), lung (35%), local recurrence (10%) and peritoneum (10%). A median of 3 cycles (range, 1-7) was delivered, and no objective response was observed in the group of patients pretreated with doxifluridine or in the group pretreated with fluorouracil. In 5 cases a significant decrease in baseline CEA values was observed. Therapy was well tolerated, and no grade 4 toxicity was encountered. Severe toxicity was limited and included diarrhea (7 patients), stomatitis (1 patient) and nausea/vomiting (1 patient). High-dose FA has no role in reversing resistance to fluoropyrimidine, and other mechanisms of refractoriness are surely involved. FA should be associated with fluoropyrimidine as first-line therapy together with other biochemical modulators. Further rescue therapies need to be developed."}

Fifteen (60%) patients showed a rise in serum CEA levels above 5 ng/ml. Planar scans and emission computed tomographic (ECT) imaging were carried out without reference to the results of computed tomographic (CT) scans and gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations done 1-2 weeks before IS. Final diagnoses were based on biopsies and autopsies (13 cases) or on follow-up findings over at least 2 years (12 cases). Sixteen patients had a final diagnosis of recurrent malignant disease in the extrahepatic abdomen or pelvis. Of these, six were correctly diagnosed by both IS and conventional diagnostic procedures, six by IS only and two by conventional methods only. Two tumour recurrences remained undetected by both diagnostic approaches. However, five tumour recurrences were detected by IS more than 4 months earlier than by any other diagnostic procedures performed during clinical follow-up. Of the nine disease-free patients (disregarding the liver) three were correctly identified by both IS and the other diagnostic methods, four by IS only and two by conventional diagnostic procedures only. Overall sensitivity (75%) and specificity (89%) of 111In-IS were higher than figures obtained using CT scanning and endoscopy (50% and 78% respectively). True positive IS was observed in 6/15 (40%) CEA seropositive patients and in 6/10 (60%) CEA seronegative patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Hitherto anti-CEA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), normally of mouse origin, have been used primarily for clinical diagnosis of colorectal cancer, either as a tumor marker in serum to monitor tumor recurrence, or latterly as a means to localize in vivo CEA-bearing tumors, and metastases in patients. In vivo diagnosis using mouse anti-CEA MAbs has so far had limited clinical utility because the antibodies elicit a strong anti-mouse immunoglobulin immune response on repeated administration in man. This problem has been addressed by the development of various strategies for \"humanization\" of mouse anti-CEA MAbs by genetic manipulation of immunoglobulin genes. Such humanized, engineered antibodies markedly attenuate the antigenic response directed against the MAb, such that safe, repeated administration to patients has become feasible. Such humanized anti-CEA antibodies can thus be radioactively-labelled and applied for in vivo monitoring and detection of recurrent malignant disease, or used for therapeutic strategies which similarly take advantage of the ability of the antibodies to target cytotoxic agents selectively to tumor cells. The application of these novel procedures for manipulating MAb structure presents entirely new opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of human colorectal cancer."}

The sensitivity of both B72.3 and anti-CEA was greater than 70% either for primary tumors and abdominal recurrences or distant metastases except hepatic ones. A significant gradient in antibody uptake was measured on surgical biopsies between tumors and normal tissues allowing a good in vivo contrast for gamma detection. We have defined the impact of some factors affecting in vivo tumor targeting. In fact, pharmacodynamics of MAbs, percentage of injected dose bound to tissues were measured, and in particular antigenic content in tumor nodules was quantified. Furthermore, the results of RIS were compared to those obtained by CT and other imaging modalities."}

Thirty CT scans were performed on seven patients who had undergone a total of 11 CE procedures. All patients had baseline, immediate postprocedural, and follow-up CT exams at 1 to 2 month intervals following CE. Immediate post-procedural CT scans mapped the area of embolization owing to the density of the contrast mixed with the CE agents. Some lesions seen easily on baseline were more difficult to see as they became isodense with normal liver. Reflux of embolic material into the cystic artery and gallbladder wall was also observed on postprocedural scans in three patients. In all patients, early follow-up scans (1 month after CE) demonstrated changes in lesions seen on baseline scans consistent with tumor necrosis. This was corroborated by a decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. In three patients, however, low attenuation regions developed in areas in which there had been no lesion before. The significance of these is uncertain, but the low CEA values and the subsequent evolution in appearance of these sites on CT suggest that they were regions of hepatic ischemia/infarction as opposed to heretofore unidentifiable metastases, now \"unmasked.\" Intermediate follow-up scans (2-3 months) revealed maximal effect on tumor volume, with a decrease of > or = 25% in five of seven patients (71%). Late follow-up scans (> or = 3 months after the last CE) confirmed recurrent disease and new lesions in all cases."}

The circulating preoperative median PRL and CEA levels were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients than in their respective controls. PRL was elevated in all Dukes stages and in all histological grades of the tumour whereas the rise in CEA was more pronounced in Dukes D. Out of 74 patients, 29% (21/74) developed recurrent disease and 31% (23/74) responded to the treatment. With regard to monitoring recurrence(s), the predictive value of PRL was 94% which was significantly greater than that of CEA which was only 62%. In patients who developed liver metastases PRL remained elevated whereas CEA showed more than 100-fold increase. Therefore, we feel that CEA is a better marker for monitoring patients who developed liver metastases. From our results, we suggest that PRL can be used as a better overall marker for detecting recurrence(s) in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma."}

The patient was an 81-year-old male who had undergone gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. Eight months post-operatively, the plasma CEA began to rise logarithmically, and recurrent tumor in the remnant stomach and liver metastasis were detected by fibergastroscope (FGS) and abdominal CT. After administration of UFT at a dose of 300 mg per day, CEA abruptly declined logarithmically and normalized in 6 months.

Preoperative serum concentrations of the four markers were determined in 198 colorectal cancer patients and 57 patients with a benign colorectal disorder. The cumulative frequency distributions of the malignant and benign group show strong overlap for all markers, which indicates low diagnostic ability. This is confirmed by the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, which have areas under the curve of 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.73) for CA 19-9, CA 50 and CA 195 and of 0.70 (95%) CI 0.63-0.77) for CEA. The new tumour markers appear to be of slightly less diagnostic value than CEA for the primary diagnosis of colorectal cancer, although the discrepancy is not statistically significant. The low diagnostic power of CA 19-9, CA 50 and CA 195 may be due to a high proportion of colorectal cancer patients having the Lewis(a-b-) phenotype, who cannot synthesise these markers."}

{"id": "1281552", "title": "Tumor markers.", "content": "Tumor markers. The past decade has seen many advances in the detection, characterization, and clinical applications of tumor markers. Although cancer screening applications have been limited by low disease prevalences in asymptomatic populations, tumor markers may be of diagnostic value in specific situations. The major use of tumor markers in primary care is in monitoring disease recurrence and the response to therapy. These uses may obviate the need for second-look surgery as it has with CA 125 elevations in ovarian carcinoma. On the other hand, tumor markers may indicate a need for second-look surgery as when CEA levels are elevated in colorectal carcinoma. Despite the apparent usefulness of markers in detecting cancer recurrence, the clinician is reminded of the conditions justifying treatment with the discovery of an abnormal laboratory value as put forth by Fries and Holman: (1) the treatment should be known to be effective, (2) early treatment should be known to be more effective than therapy given after the disease is clinically apparent (or early treatment carry the risk of less toxicity), and (3) prediction of impending deterioration must be consistently accurate. When these criteria are met, the planning of therapeutic regimens on the basis of marker levels may be rationally considered. Until these criteria are met, elevated markers can only stimulate the clinician to be more vigilant in the search for response to therapy or recurrence. Exciting developments are on the horizon with respect to the use of tumor markers in radionuclide imaging, radioimmunoguided surgery, and development of drug delivery systems. Further research into the structure and function of these substances may provide further insights into the phenomena of malignant transformation, tumor invasion, metastasis, and the development of new therapeutic options. With new advances in molecular biology and with the identification of oncogenes, it may be possible in the future to detect mutant oncoproteins that are specific for early cancers and premalignant conditions. Delecting these oncoproteins may provide a basis for development of truly sensitive and specific markers that can be used to detect cancer at an early and curable stage."}

In this paper, we review the results of second-look surgery for recurrent colorectal carcinoma and ask the question, \"Is it worthwhile?\" Excluding surgery for symptomatic patients, we conclude that second-look surgery should only be performed for recurrent colorectal carcinoma with the intent of rendering the patient disease-free. Without effective systemic therapy, \"palliative\" or \"debulking\" procedures probably do not increase survival. The most likely candidates for such a curative approach with second-look surgery are those with isolated liver, pulmonary, and, less frequently, regional recurrences."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen has been demonstrated to be a valuable clinical aid in the management of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Its elevation in the serum prior to evidence of clinical recurrence in up to 80% of patients highlights its utility. CEA has also been found to be elevated in the serum of patients with other epithelial malignancies, but these have not been as well studied as has colorectal carcinoma. In patients with breast cancer CEA elevations may be found in 40-73% of patients presenting with disease in stages I-IV. In addition, 80% of patients will have a CEA elevation 3-10 months prior to clinical symptoms of recurrence. Seventy-seven percent of patients with bronchogenic lung cancer will have an elevated preoperative value. However, cigarette smoking also causes an increase in the CEA assay level and, thus, differentiation between benign and malignant conditions is more difficult. In small cell carcinoma of the lung, CEA assay levels above 10 ng/ml correlate highly with metastatic disease, while values less than 2.5 ng/ml correlate with localized disease. Pancreatic and gastric malignancies demonstrate CEA level elevations in just over 50% of cases. But these, however, have not been clinically useful. Epithelial neoplasms of the female reproductive tract (cervix, uterus, and ovary) also produce CEA in 47-75% of cases and may correlate with stage of disease at diagnosis and level of cellular differentiation.

This study comprises a total of 141 patients with suspected primary and recurrent colorectal carcinomas, in whom immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-Mab BW 431/26 was performed. Whole-body scans were done 5.5 hr and SPECT imaging of the abdominal region was done at 6 and 24 hr postinjection of 1100 MBq 99mTc-labeled Mab (1 mg). In the course of primary tumor identification (n = 65), sensitivity of anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy was 95%, specificity 91%. In the diagnosis of early recurrences (n = 76), immunoscintigraphy was the method of choice to clarify the problem (sensitivity 94%; specificity 86%). Overall sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy in patients with suspected colorectal carcinomas and early recurrences was 95%, specificity 88%. Human anti-mouse antibodies were found in 29% (80% predominantly anti-isotypic, 20% predominantly anti-idiotypic). In contrast to anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy, the results of serum CEA levels were rather disappointing. Only 18 out of the 43 surgically verified primary colorectal carcinomas and 17 out of 32 patients with recurrences showed elevated serum CEA levels. In our clinical experience with this 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA antibody, immunoscintigraphy can play an important role in the identification of early colorectal recurrences and in postoperative colorectal cancer patients it should be performed in cases with unclear transmission computed tomography."}

A murine monoclonal antibody directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was labeled with indium-111 (111In) by means of a benzylisothiocyanate derivative of diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) and used for clinical radioimmunodetection studies. Twenty-one patients having a history of surgically resected colorectal cancer and rising serum CEA levels suggestive of tumor recurrence were studied. Patients were infused over 20 minutes with 5, 10, or 20 mg of the monoclonal antibody labeled with 5 mCi of 111In. The mean radiochemical purity was greater than 96%. No toxicity was seen. The stability of the radiolabel on antibody in patient serum was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with autoradiography, and immunoprecipitation for up to 96 hours after infusion. Tumor sites were identified in 20 of 21 patients. Sites of antibody accumulation in 20 patients were confirmed as tumor either by resection at laparotomy (16 patients) or fine-needle biopsy (four patients). Nine patients who had the identified lesion resected or irradiated showed return of the serum CEA antigen level to normal or near normal values. In the absence of high levels of circulating CEA (greater than 500 ng/mL), the disappearance of radioactivity from patient serum demonstrated first order elimination kinetics, with a mean half-life of 38 hours. The serum half-life was not affected by the dose of antibody administered or by serum CEA titers below 500 ng/mL. Despite a mean liver uptake of 18% injected dose (ID) 24 hours after administration, hepatic metastases were easily visualized as areas of increased uptake of radioactivity. Radioimmunodetection of recurrent colorectal cancer, not detected by computed tomographic (CT) scans, appears achievable with this agent. This may allow successful clinical intervention in selected patients."}

Clearer intraoperative definition of tumor margins and identification of occult tumor assisted the surgeon in the resection of liver metastases as well as nodal and pelvic disease. Unsuspected nodal disease was identified. The external use of the Neoprobe to scan the sacral region and intrarectal and intravaginal use led to the avoidance of operative procedures by defining inoperable disease. In approximately 25% of cases, the surgical procedure was modified based on Neoprobe findings. RIGS system provides a method of immediate intraoperative staging which may prevent additional recurrences, lead to earlier institution of adjuvant therapy, and result in improved survival."}

There was a significant (P less than 0.01) difference in the distribution of tumors of various histopathologic grades between irradiated (XS) and unirradiated (S) patients and borderline differences in the predictive values of venous spread, tumor grading, and local spread. However, these differences were less marked in 180 tumors examined by one review pathologist. They were thought to be due to misinterpretation of changes induced by radiotherapy. No differences were detected in the distribution of tumors of various sizes and Dukes' stage in the XS and S groups. The review pathologist recorded a borderline (P = 0.049) difference in the distribution of tumors of various CEA staining patterns between the XS and S groups. In a Cox regression model. Dukes' staging remained the most important predictive variable for survival and pelvic recurrence in the XS and S groups. Dukes' staging was apparently unchanged by this schedule of preoperative radiotherapy, but Broders' grading may be unreliable. Any new clinicopathologic staging system for colorectal cancer should record when preoperative radiotherapy is delivered. More studies of radiotherapy effects are required."}

We report here the results of the first multiinstitutional prospective evaluation of patients considered to have potentially resectable hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma. One hundred fifty-six patients were enrolled from 15 institutions. Six patients were subsequently excluded. One hundred fifty patients underwent surgery and are evaluable for analysis (median follow-up time, 3.1 years; range, 4 months to 5.1 years). Curative resection could be performed on 46% of patients (69 of 150), noncurative resection on 12% (18 of 150), while 42% were found to be unresectable (63 of 150). Thirty-day surgical mortality and morbidity rates in patients with attempted resection were 2.7% and 13%, respectively. The curative resection group was observed to have an improved median survival (37.1 months) compared with the noncurative resection group (21.2 months) and the unresectable group (16.5 months) (P less than .01). Computed tomographic (CT) scan was a poor predictor for resectability, and age was not a contraindication to curative resection. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values were also a poor predictor for resectability. However, the median CEA value 61 to 180 days postsurgery was significantly higher in unresectable patients compared with median CEA levels in noncuratively and curatively resected groups (P less than .01). Our results imply that curative resection leads to an increase in median survival. Noncurative resection provides no benefit to asymptomatic patients, since unresectable and noncurative resection groups have similar life expectancies. Longer follow-up will be needed to demonstrate the ultimate impact of curative resection on survival."}

The primary role that tumor markers for cancer of the colon and rectum have at this time is for postoperative surveillance of those patients resected for cure who are at risk for recurrence of the disease. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels are followed by most surgeons prospectively after the potentially curative resection. This tumor marker has not been advocated as a screening test for these cancers; however, a preoperative CEA serum level is determined in those patients before the initial surgery for colon or rectal cancer. The serum level of CEA is mainly determined by tumor differentiation and stage of disease. If the CEA serum level begins to increase during the postoperative surveillance period, the recurrence of colon or rectal cancer must be suspected. Further investigations are then performed to identify the location and resectability of the recurrent disease. Monoclonal antibodies labeled with radioisotope are presently being used clinically to identify recurrence of colon and rectal cancer. Used in conjunction with elevated serum CEA levels (or other determinants of recurrent disease) these tumor markers can specifically identify site(s) of cancer recurrence. Theoretically, by attaching cancer-fighting agents (i.e., chemotherapeutic agents) to the monoclonal antibody, the site of tumor recurrence can be potentially treated, too. Hence, these \"tumor-seeking missiles\" may one day be used to treat cancer recurrence."}

Both methods gave comparable results for the healthy subjects but discordant values for some polyp patients. The Tandem-E test gave increased CEA results more frequently for two groups of polyp patients, the group of ex-smokers with neoplastic polyps (n = 14) and the group of smokers (n = 20).

The practical import of surveillance with imaging and laboratory tests for recurrence in patients with cancer of the breast and colon is discussed. Reported autopsy data, findings at elective reoperation, and clinical data have been examined to ascertain the justification for routine periodic tests in the treated but asymptomatic patient. It is concluded that earlier detection of a local recurrence or of metastatic disease through periodic tests in the asymptomatic patient with breast or colon cancer rarely alters the treatment or the outcome. A notable exception is regular screening mammography following treatment for adenocarcinoma of the breast."}

Therapeutic efficacy was determined by measuring the change in tumor size over time, quantifying the absolute number of tumors responding to radioantibody therapy, and determining the percentage growth inhibition of each treatment at various times after radioantibody administration. Several mechanisms are discussed to explain the improved tumoricidal effect of the antibody mixture noted in this model system, such as (a) the possibility that an antibody mixture could target a greater number of tumor cells, (b) the potential for antibody mixtures to provide better tumor distribution and (c) the possibility that antibodies administered in combination can increase the magnitude of tumor uptake of individual radioantibodies, thereby resulting in a greater radiation dose delivered to the tumor."}

In a multivariate regression analysis of age, location, tumor stage, and preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, the latter three factors were significant prognostic variables with respect to the adjusted survival. Recurrent disease was found in 42% of patients, excluding patients with stage IV disease. The carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was greater than 5 ng/mL in 79% of the patients and in 89% of the intra-abdominal recurrences. Carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was not predictive of postrecurrence survival except in the subgroup of locoregional disease. The life span in patients with liver and lung metastases was not influenced by carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence. Preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels can indicate a poorer prognostic group of patients with colorectal cancer who may benefit from adjuvant treatment.

New diagnostic tools, including endoscopic ultrasound, the CA19-9 radioimmunoassay, and the carcinoembryonic antigen assay, have improved clinicians' ability to detect early-stage and recurrent disease. Efforts to enhance response to fluorouracil (5-FU) in the treatment of colorectal cancer by the addition of various immunologic or biochemical modulators have yielded encouraging results.

Cryosurgery, the in situ freezing of cancer, has been proposed in the past as a possible treatment for unresectable hepatic tumors. Its advantage lies in the fact that it is a very focal treatment sacrificing less normal tissue than surgical resection, allowing treatment of multiple lobes. Because cryosurgery does not affect large vessels, tumors in difficult locations, such as adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC), can be treated. With the use of intraoperative ultrasound to place the cryoprobes and monitor the freezing process, 18 patients with unresectable metastatic colon carcinoma confined to the liver were treated. Of the 18 patients treated, 4 (22%) are in complete remission as determined by computed tomography (CT) scans and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, with a mean follow-up of 28.8 months. Four patients (22%) were not adequately treated at the time of cryosurgery. The number of lesions frozen in each patient ranged from 1 to 12, with a mean of 6 lesions. Fourteen patients had bilobar disease; three patients had previous right lobectomies with recurrences in their remaining left lobes prior to cryosurgery, and one patient had unilobar disease. Mean survival of the 14 cases with recurrence was 21.4 months, with 2 of the 14 still alive. Ultrasound-guided hepatic cryosurgery appears to be an effective treatment for metastatic colon carcinoma to the liver that is unresectable (including patients with bilobar and multiple lesions).

Of the initial 151 selected patients, 61 (40%) developed a recurrence in whom only six cases (10%) of potentially curable recurrent lesions were detected. The first clues to recurrence in the 61 patients were history or physical examination in 49%, a rising CEA in 29% and a positive imaging finding in 10%, being difficult to decide which test first signalled a recurrent cancer in an additional 11%. Endoscopy and CEA determinations were the most rewarding investigations. CEA was a sensitive means of identifying disseminated recurrent disease and liver metastases compared with liver function tests or liver ultrasound every 3 months. Endoscopy was useful in the diagnosis of local recurrences. However no follow-up test was capable of detecting recurrent colorectal cancer when it might still have been curable. As a direct result of this follow-up programme 15 patients (23%) underwent re-exploration. No symptomatic patients were candidates for curative re-operation. Of the asymptomatic patients six (four colonic and two rectal cancers) (19.5%) were re-resected for cure. Only three of these were alive and without evidence of disease, 40, 43 and 69 months later so that long term survivors after curative re-resection represent only 5% of all patients with recurrences (7.2% of the recurrent colonic cancer and 3% of the rectal cancer). Our follow-up programme did not permit us to alter the incidence of disseminated recurrent disease, and the effectiveness of the curative re-resection represents an increase of only 1.3% in the global 5-year survival rates for colorectal cancer. Our study does not demonstrate any great value of 'classical' postoperative follow-up programme."}

A longitudinal study. Eighty-two patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal (GI) adenocarcinoma were evaluated before and for 26 months after primary tumor resection for the presence of two serum tumor markers: tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Elevated TAG-72 and CEA serum levels were found preoperatively in 32 (39%) and 34 (41.5%) of the 82 patients, respectively. The percentage of patients with elevated serum levels of either TAG-72 or CEA was 56.1% (46 of 82). Twelve (15%) patients who had normal CEA serum levels had elevated TAG-72 serum levels, and conversely, serum from 14 (17%) patients who were TAG-72 negative were CEA positive. Forty-five of the 82 patients were diagnosed with advanced disease (i.e., Stages C and D for colorectal, Stages III and IV for stomach), and 29 (64.4%) and 26 (57.8%) of those patients had elevated serum levels of TAG-72 or CEA, respectively. Elevated levels of either TAG-72 or CEA, however, were found in sera of 82.2% of patients with advanced GI cancer, which is an increase of 24.4% over the use of CEA antigen alone as a marker of disease. The measurement of both TAG-72 and CEA may improve the diagnosis of patients with GI malignant disease due to the apparent complementary association which exists between these tumor markers. Serum TAG-72 and CEA levels were monitored in 31 patients for varying lengths of time after resection of the carcinoma; 11 patients developed recurrent disease. Sera from nine of 11 (81.8%) of these patients had elevated TAG-72 levels and six of 11 (54.5%) had elevated CEA levels. Tumor marker elevations were observed either before (35 to 166 days) or at the time of diagnosis of recurrence. The elevation of one or both markers correlated with the clinical status in ten of 11 (90.9%) patients with recurrence. In addition, 20 patients who were clinically free of disease after more than 700 days' follow-up had normal serum levels of both TAG-72 and CEA. These findings suggest that the combined use of serum TAG-72 and CEA measurements may improve detection of recurrence in patients with GI cancer and may be useful in the postsurgical management of GI adenocarcinoma patients."}

Eighty-six colorectal cancer patients who entered the Radioimmunoguided Surgery (RIGS) protocol study were evaluated for 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival following second-look surgical procedures. Strict preoperative evaluation criteria eliminated patients with extra-abdominal tumor involvement. A saturated potassium iodide preparation was given before the intravenous administration of the B72.3 monoclonal antibody (1 mg) radiolabeled with 2 mCi of iodine-125 by the IODOGEN method. Precordial monitoring of the biologic clearance by the handheld, gamma-detecting probe (Neoprobe 1000 instrument) was conducted at weekly intervals until the average count was less than 20 counts in 2 seconds. Once the drug cleared from the blood, surgery was performed. The mean time interval between injection and operation was 24 days, with a range of 21 to 28 days and a median of 23 days. At surgery the abdomen was explored through the traditional methods of palpation and inspection, and the surgeon committed to a planned procedure. The abdomen was then re-explored with the handheld, gamma-detecting probe and the surgeon stated another intraoperative assessment. After using both traditional and RIGS detection methods, the surgeon stated whether his or her surgical plans changed because of the additional intraoperative information provided by the RIGS system. Fifty-three patients (62%) were deemed resectable by the traditional methods of palpation and inspection, but only 40 (47%) were specified as resectable by RIGS exploration. Two-, three-, four-, and five-year survival data could be gathered for each of the three groups: RIGS resectable (n = 40), traditional nonresectable (n = 33), and RIGS nonresectable (n = 13). At 2 years 95% of the resectable, 36% of the traditional nonresectable, and 53% of RIGS nonresectable patients survived. At 3 years 83%, 7%, and 30% of these patients survived, respectively. For the resectable patients, 74% survived at 4 years and 60% at 5 years, with no survivors from either nonresectable group. Use of the RIGS system increased accurate selection of resectable patients undergoing second-look surgery for recurrent colorectal cancer."}

Recurrent disease from colorectal carcinomas is common. 25 percent of patients have apparent metastases at the time of first detection of the tumor, and at least 50% of patients die from their tumor. The aim of the postoperative follow-up of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum is thus to detect recurrent tumor when cure is still possible. Clinical examination and CEA-measurement is widely recommended as a reliable indicator for recurrence and metastases of colonic cancer. This may be combined with regular coloscopic surveillance for detection of anastomotic recurrences or a second colonic cancer. In case of suspicion of a recurrence or metastasis a full range of examinations should be performed to detect the site of recurrent tumor and to exclude wide spread disease. In case of a circumscribed lesion the patients may benefit from local radical resection. Patients with four or less unilateral liver metastases show a five year disease free survival reported of more than 30% and a disease free survival reported of more than 25%. Unfortunately because of wide spread misunderstanding of the potential of hepatic Rx only about 1/3 of potentially curatively resectable patients with liver metastases finally undergo liver surgery. A more active policy towards patients with colorectal disease concerning surveillance may lead to a better survival in selected cases."}

Preliminary results of these trials show, some of them already statistically significant, an advantage of the adjuvant treated patient group. Unless these results have been confirmed, adjuvant treatment should only be given in well designed, randomized clinical trials. Only these trials can prove the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy in radical surgery of colorectal neoplasms. In addition, these studies should be used to define the group of patients who really benefit of adjuvant treatment. The main goal of follow up methods after surgery for colorectal cancer should be the detection of asymptomatic and still treatable tumor recurrences. For this reason, frequent clinical investigations and frequent CEA level determinations seem to be the most important components at this time."}

The optimal laboratory evaluation for the early detection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer is controversial. This investigation was undertaken to compare the efficacy of liver function tests (LFTs) with that of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels for the early detection of liver metastases. Patients who developed liver metastases after potentially curative resections of adenocarcinoma of the colorectum between 1974 and 1988 were reviewed. The following laboratory tests were serially evaluated during the follow-up period: CEA, alkaline phosphatase (AP), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). These values were retrospectively assessed from the time of documented liver metastases to identify which lab value(s) were elevated initially. Ninety-two patients were available for study. Average time for the occurrence of liver metastases was 20 months (range, 3-72 months). The incidence of elevation of individual tests at the time of suspicion of liver metastasis was: CEA, 94.6 percent (P less than 0.25, chi-squared); AP, 18.5 percent; SGOT, 12.0 percent; SGPT, 5.4 percent; and LDH, 29.3 percent. When comparing CEA with a battery of LFTs at the time of suspicion of liver metastasis, CEA was elevated with normal LFTs in 64.1 percent (P less than 0.05, chi-squared), the most frequent occurrence. At least one LFT was elevated with a normal CEA in only 2.2 percent; CEA and at least one LFT were increased in 30.4 percent; and both tests were normal in only 3.3 percent. These results indicate that, of the individual laboratory tests performed, CEA elevation heralds liver metastases significantly more frequently. LDH is the liver function test most frequently elevated when liver metastases are first suspected. When CEA is directly compared with a battery of LFTs, CEA is statistically significantly more frequently elevated. In fact, suspicion of liver metastases would have been delayed by the omission of LFTs in only 2.2 percent of patients. Therefore, we conclude that LFTs should be deleted from the follow-up of colorectal cancer patients, decreasing costs without significantly decreasing accuracy."}

A novel gene product which is immunologically related to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and constitutively expressed by six of eight human gastric carcinoma cell lines is described. The antigen was initially identified by the differential binding patterns of four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which recognize the putative Mr 180,000 CEA and/or the Mr 90,000 CEA-related gene product, NCA (normal cross-reacting antigen). Western blot analyses of partially purified membrane fractions prepared from Hs 746T gastric carcinoma cells identified an Mr 110,000 antigen. Northern blot analyses using CEA- and NCA-specific complementary DNA probes did not identify any specific CEA or NCA transcripts in polyadenylate-selected mRNA isolated from the Hs 746T cells. Likewise, a probe designed to hybridize with different CEA-related family members failed to identify a CEA-related message in the Hs 746T cells. Subsequent studies revealed that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment substantially increased the level of expression of the Mr 110,000 antigen on the Hs 746T and five other gastric cell types that constitutively expressed the antigen. IFN-gamma treatment also de novo induced the expression of the Mr 110,000 antigen on the surface of GaCa gastric carcinoma cells. A high percentage of Hs 746T (i.e., greater than 85%) and GaCa (approximately 75%) gastric carcinoma cells expressed the Mr 110,000 antigen after IFN-gamma treatment; yet, neither cell type expressed CEA or NCA as measured by the binding of the anti-CEA MAb, COL-1, or B6.2, an anti-NCA MAb. In contrast to CEA and NCA, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C treatment failed to release the Mr 110,000 antigen from the surface of the Hs 746T or IFN-gamma-treated GaCa cells, suggesting that membrane attachment of this novel antigen is not via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. Finally, primers that amplify the 420 base pairs of the immunoglobulin-like domain of CEA and NCA detected an appropriately sized product in untreated as well as IFN-gamma-treated GaCa cells using the polymerase chain reaction method. Thus, a potentially novel gene product coding for an Mr 110,000 antigen that is strongly upregulated by IFN-gamma has been identified in human gastric carcinoma cells. Immunologically, the antigen shares reactive epitopes with CEA and its related NCA gene product; however, Northern blot analyses, polymerase chain reaction, and phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C results suggest that the antigen may be, at best, a distant relative of the CEA gene family."}

The presence of TAG-72 in serum samples from 260 patients with colorectal disease (malignant or benign) has been evaluated using the CA72-4 assay. Approximately 40% of patients with colorectal cancer exhibit elevated levels of this marker; moreover, the presence of positive levels of TAG-72 significantly correlates with advanced stages of disease, suggesting that TAG-72 may be a good marker of advanced colorectal cancer. Only 2% of the patients diagnosed with colorectal disease had elevated TAG-72 serum levels indicating the high specificity of this marker. A comparative study with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels showed a complementarity of the two tumor markers; in fact, 49.6% of CEA negative cases scored positive for TAG-72. A longitudinal evaluation of TAG-72 serum levels in 31 patients with malignant disease was performed. The results indicate that patients with increasing TAG-72 serum levels postoperatively may be indicative of recurrent disease. In 60% of patients in which significant changes of CEA levels could not be detected, TAG-72 showed rising positive levels prior to clinical evidence of recurrent disease. These results suggest that the simultaneous use of TAG-72 and CEA serum markers may be useful in the diagnosis of recurrent disease and therefore play an important role in the clinical management of cancer patients."}

Careful selection should therefore spare those patients unnecessary investigations who are least likely to benefit from follow-up. Only patients should be considered whose tumor was completely resected and who were found free of distant metastases. These patients should be fully informed about their disease and accept scheduled investigation even if asymptomatic. A questionable operability with regard to a second surgical intervention forbids formal entry into a follow-up program as well as a decreased life expectancy due to other disease. The family physician is most qualified to carry out or coordinate these investigations. For the first two postoperative years intervals of three and for the further three years of six months are recommended. Physical examination and determination of CEA titers are the essential measures; colonoscopy, sonography, CT scans, chest X-ray, and for rectal cancer, endoluminal sonography are undertaken periodically.

An increased interest in surgical treatment of liver metastases from colorectal origin has evolved recently. However not all patients benefit from this approach, with early recurrence and death still being encountered. To evaluate clinical as well as perioperative factors that might significantly affect the outcome of patients with completely resected colorectal liver metastases, we examined 116 patients who underwent resection between September 1987 and August 1989. Median follow-up time was 13.2 months (0.6 to 31.4 months). The overall survival rate was 91% at 1 year and 75% at 2 years. Median survival was not reached. Median disease-free survival time was 11.5 months, with 49.4% and 21.2% of the patients being free of disease at 1 and 2 years, respectively. By univariate analysis, site of primary colorectal cancer, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, size of metastases, number of metastases, length of operation time, percentage mean arterial pressure, number of hypotensive episodes, duration of hypotensive episodes, and whole blood transfusion significantly affected recurrence rate following resection. However only site of primary tumor, CEA, number of metastases, and number of hypotensive episodes remained significant in the multivariate analysis. The most significant single factor that affected recurrence rate was the number of hypotensive episodes during the operative procedure. It is concluded that hypotensive episodes, even when well controlled, should be avoided during operation to maximize the chances of cure and prolong disease-free survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases."}

Eighty four colorectal cancer patients who underwent presumably curative surgery were considered as candidates for control recurrence study.

Thirteen patients (15%) refused to participate in the study or abandoned it early, thus 71 patients are finally evaluated. After a mean follow up of 64 months, 32 patients presented a total of 42 recurrences (several patients underwent complete resection of the recurrence and presented new relapses). Recurrence diagnosis was always done by conventional exam (there was no second look guided by CEA values). Complete resection of the initial recurrence was achieved in 22% of cases (7 patients), but only 2 (6.5% of total relapses) are up to date tumor free and potentially cured after a long follow up. The most useful tests for the diagnosis of organ specific recurrences were chest X-ray (lung metastasis), liver echography (liver metastasis), liver echography (liver metastasis), colonoscopy (intraluminal local recurrence) and pelvis CT scan (pelvic recurrences). The carcinoembryogenic antigen was very specific, but only moderately sensitive, in predicting tumoral recurrency. However, CEA levels at relapse predicted the complete resection of recurrent tumor (58% with carcinoembryogenic antigen equal to or lower than 10 ng/ml compared to 5.5% with carcinoembryogenic antigen above this value p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Aneuploid tumours had an elevated CEA level in 38% of stage A-B disease and in 61% of stage C-D disease. The elevated CEA values (greater than or equal to 5.0 micrograms/l) correlated with tumour stage in patients with aneuploid tumours but not in patients with diploid tumours.

The clinically most important circulating TM in non-hormone secreting tumors of the gastrointestinal tract are the oncofetal antigens CEA and AFP and antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies e. g.

Serum TAG-72 and CEA levels were evaluated longitudinally in a series of patients following resection of primary G.I. carcinomas. A consistent relationship between efficacy of the surgery and serum TAG-72 clearance was observed, and TAG-72 alone or in combination with CEA accurately predicted recurrence of malignant disease in greater than 90% of the patients.

The bifunctional antibody, with one specificity to a tumor-associated antigen (carcinoembryonic antigen) and another specificity to a hapten, is injected and allowed to localize at a tumor site for 4 days. A hapten, tagged with a radioisotope, is subsequently injected for delivery to and capture by the prelocalized antibody at the tumor site. In studies reported here, the sulfhydryl groups of Fab' fragments of ZCE-025 and CHA-255 were linked with bis-maleimidomethyl ether to form an F(ab')2 bifunctional antibody coupled by a stable thioether linkage.

CEA plasma levels were measured from blood samples taken immediately before the PET study. A significant decrease in FDG uptake despite good palliative results were observed in only 50% of the patients. This may be explained by inflammatory reactions caused by radiation injury. Inflammation and metabolically active residual tumor tissue cannot be distinguished. It is concluded that an observation interval longer than 6 mo may more effectively detect residual tumor activity.

In the management of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence of colorectal carcinoma, surgery remains the primary mode of therapy when cure or significant palliation is anticipated. Appreciation of the importance of close follow-up after primary resection coupled with improved diagnostic modalities has allowed the surgeon not only to detect earlier recurrence but also to select the patients most likely to benefit from resection of recurrent disease. Improved surgical techniques with resultant decreases in the rates of morbidity and mortality have allowed safe hepatic resection of metastatic disease. In selected patients, this procedure produces 5-year survival rates approaching 50%. Although a clear consensus has not been reached, most studies agree that positive prognostic indicators include absence of extrahepatic disease, a small number of intrahepatic lesions, a low CEA level, and a better Dukes stage of the primary. Likewise, in the patient with recurrent disease locally, surgery provides the only means of cure and also plays a significant role in palliation. Aggressive resection with generous surgical margins in patients with contained disease may yield 5-year survival rates approaching 35%. In patients with unresectable disease and even in those with carcinomatosis, palliation can be obtained by surgical therapy.

Comparison of staining patterns showed a loss of marker expression from normal colonic mucosa to colorectal primary carcinomas, and a tendency to marker loss from the primary tumour to liver metastases. However, even a neo-expression of markers not present in the primary tumour could be observed. For clinical use, serum markers observed in patient follow-up may be valuable even where the findings are negative at the time of primary tumour surgery. In contrast to the heterogenous marker map of primary tumours and metastases, comparison of primary and locally recurrent tumour revealed a staining pattern that was almost always identical.

There was a linear correlation for tumour to normal colon ratios between the gamma detecting probe and the same tissue examined in a conventional well counter (correlation coefficient r = 0.78, P less than 0.001). Colorectal tumours demonstrate a rapid and reliable uptake of anti-CEA monoclonal antibody A5B7. This antibody can be detected with a peroperative gamma detecting probe and has the potential to improve the surgeon's appreciation of the extent of tumour and therefore may influence the surgery performed. Detailed clinical studies are now being carried out."}

Nuclear scintigraphy was performed on days 3 and 5 through 7 to detect potential sites of tumor recurrence. The monoclonal antibody scan accurately predicted the presence or absence of occult malignancy in 7 (64%) patients. Second-look laparotomy confirmed the monoclonal antibody scan results in the patients with colorectal cancer, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed metastatic breast cancer.

The use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to monitor patients after intentionally curative colon cancer resection can have advantages (improved life expectancy as a result of early detection of recurrences) as well as disadvantages (false-positive CEA rises and early detection of incurable recurrences in asymptomatic patients). This study estimated how the favorable and unfavorable effects of CEA monitoring affect life expectancy and quality of life of colon cancer patients. These effects were simulated using a Markov analysis for which the variables had been defined on the basis of data found in literature. The influence of CEA monitoring on quality adjusted life expectancy appears to be modest and varies, according to the data used, from an average increase of +7 days (+0.3%) to an average decrease of -5 days (-0.09%). This value is dependent, among other things, on patient related variables; the adverse effects especially dominate in older patients with a favorable Dukes' stage of the primary tumor and if operative mortality exceeds 2%. The total cost of CEA monitoring, including diagnosis and therapy performed as a result of true- or false-positive CEA rise, is considerable. High cost and low return leads to a high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio, which varies from $22,963 to $4,888,208 per quality adjusted life year saved. It is concluded that CEA monitoring should not be used for routine following of colon cancer patients, as its advantages have so far been demonstrated insufficiently."}

A significant correlation of survival time and CEA doubling time was observed. The serial serum CEA levels were examined in the 11 colorectal cancer patients with unresectable multiple liver metastasis, who were treated with intraarterial selective chemotherapy. There were no significant differences between pretreatment serum CEA and survival time on response to chemotherapy. In 9 cases showing over 40 ng/ml of CEA before treatment, however, the serial change in CEA levels correlated well with response to chemotherapy. In four cases with recurrent liver metastasis, prolongation time could be predicted from the CEA induces with respect to the forward time earning and the alternation of the CEA doubling time.

If the serum CEA doubling time is altered by any treatment from D1 to D2 we term D2/D1 as the \"CEA doubling time ratio\" of the treatment; 2. the per cent decrease in the serum CEA level from CEA1 to CEA2 is calculated by (logCEA1 - logCEA2) X 100/logCEA1; 3. the period when the CEA level has returned to normal after a treatment is termed the \"normalization period\"; 4. \"backward time retrieval\" is the period between the lowest point of the posttreatment CEA and the crossing-point of this level by the pretreatment rising slope and; 5. \"forward time earning\" can also be defined. By using these indices, surgical treatments resulted in a higher per cent decrease in CEA, a longer normalization period but a shorter doubling time when the tumor recurred."}

Compared with histologically unaffected colon tissue, concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher for putrescine, elevated for cadaverine, and nearly identical for spermidine and spermine in colon carcinoma, whereas N1-acetylated and N8-acetylated spermidine were detectable in cancer tissue only. Serum and urine concentrations of all polyamines except total cadaverine and spermine in serum and free spermine in urine were significantly elevated compared with healthy controls and highest sensitivity for colon cancer was found for total spermidine (89.15%) in serum and acetylputrescine (84.5%), total putrescine (84.0%), N1-acetylspermidine (79.3%), and total spermidine (92.1%) in urine. However, nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases partly showed similar elevations which resulted in a low specificity for polyamines in colorectal cancer. Therefore, polyamines are of little value only as diagnostic markers in colorectal carcinoma. Since polyamine concentrations in serum and urine normalized in patients after curative operation while they were further elevated in patients with proven tumor relapse or metastases, these substances might play a clinical role in predicting therapeutic success or indicating relapse of the tumor. Although a significant dependency of polyamine concentrations in serum or urine to Dukes' classification, tumor localization, CEA, CA 19-9, or CA 125 did not exist, a significant linear correlation was found for tumor size."}

Villin is an actin-binding protein found in a few normal adult epithelia, namely epithelial cells in the digestive and urogenital tracts. Moreover, villin production is maintained in malignant cells. We assumed that cell lysis and necrosis of solid tumors producing villin might result in villin release into blood. We analyzed the villin content of sera from 788 patients and controls using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients and controls were classified into healthy donors, patients with benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, patients with colorectal cancers, and patients with malignant nondigestive diseases. In the panel of sera analyzed, the sensitivity of the assay for colorectal cancers was 50.5%, and its overall specificity for malignant digestive tumors was 94.5%. Results were statistically analyzed comparing each group of sera with each other. We conclude that the presence of villin is indicative of a pathological state in the gastrointestinal tract (P less than 0.001). Finally, we followed villin levels after tumor resections (60 patients). We found that the villin level in sera remains low in remissions but is raised in recurrences. We suggest that the villin assay may have clinical utility as a diagnostic adjunct for adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. It may also have some value in monitoring patients with advancing colorectal carcinomas after resection of these tumors."}

Preoperative serum level determination of CEA and GICA can be considered a good prognostic index: infarct the increase of the levels is generally due to metastatic tissue or local recurrence.

Flow cytometric DNA content analysis is a rapid, quantitative method of determining the DNA ploidy status and proliferative index of a given tumor. Abnormal DNA content, or aneuploidy, has been recognized as a marker of malignancy and is present in about 70 per cent of solid tumors. In the majority of solid tumors, the consensus is that the presence of an aneuploid tumor predicts a poorer over-all survival rate and a shorter disease-free interval, indicating that patients with diploid tumors have a more favorable prognosis than those with aneuploid tumors. The prognostic implications of an abnormal DNA content, therefore, suggest either a higher risk of relapse, a worsening of survival rate or a risk for progression of disease in stages I and II carcinoma of the breast, carcinoma of the colon and rectum, superficial carcinoma of the bladder and malignant melanoma. Thus, the assessment of cellular DNA content should be regarded as an additional prognostic determinant and should play an ancillary role in the decisions regarding the management of patients with malignant disease.

The primary aim of postoperative surveillance of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum is to detect recurrent tumor when cure is still possible.

Patients who have had carcinoma of the colon and rectum must be observed not only because of the risk of recurrence or metastatic disease but also because of the increased risk of subsequent primary carcinomas of the colon and rectum as well as of other sites. Careful history-taking and thorough physical examination provide the first indication of tumor recurrence in as many as 48 per cent of instances. Although the liver is the most common site of metastases from carcinoma of the colon, liver chemistry tests are seldom the first to indicate recurrent disease. Fecal occult blood testing, roentgenography with barium enema and colonoscopy are useful surveillance tools, not for detecting recurrences but for detecting second primary carcinomas. Imaging techniques, such as intravenous pyelography, CT and scintigraphy of liver and spleen are generally not cost-effective in surveillance, but MRI and ultrasonography have shown some promise in detection of recurrence without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. The most effective indicator of recurrent disease is a progressive increase in serial levels of CEA. When CEA levels rise and other methods of imaging cannot account for the change, second-look operation is generally appropriate."}

In 100 patients with suspected colorectal cancer, findings of conventional diagnostic methods were compared with immunoscintigraphy results. In a first trial 131-J-labelled F (ab') 2-fragments against CEA and CA 19-9 were used in 42 patients. Evidence was confirmed by surgical exploration in 69% of cases and by close follow-up examination in 31%. In a second trial 58 patients were included, and 81% of these were explored surgically. Conventional diagnostic methods achieved better results in both series in imaging liver and extrahepatic tumor manifestations, and in both series immunoscintigraphy was especially disappointing with regard to extrahepatic tumor diagnosis (sensitivity 23% and 38%, respectively). Accuracy could not be improved by technical modifications such as change of antibodies, radiolabels or imaging techniques. The value of immunoscintigraphy as a helpful tool for the operative management of metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer must, therefore, be viewed critically."}

Twenty patients with a history of completely resected CEA-producing adenocarcinoma (18 with colon cancer, one with breast cancer, and one with Hodgkin's disease) and a rising serum CEA level were given an intravenous infusion of 2 mg of 111In-labeled ZCE-025 mixed with 38 mg of unlabeled ZCE-025. Planar and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scans were acquired at 72 and 144 hours, and in 19 of the 20 patients these were positive. Of those 19, 13 underwent exploratory surgery, and cancer was found in 10, and two had a diagnostic biopsy, which confirmed cancer. Three patients who had negative laparotomies and all four patients who did not undergo surgery or biopsy were followed radiologically. In all seven, cancer was subsequently detected at the sites suggested by the ZCE-025 scan. Thus, tumor was confirmed in all 19 patients with positive scans. Five of 13 patients who were explored benefited from the study and the exploratory laparotomy, as disease was entirely resected in four or was subjected to definitive radiation therapy to the pelvis in the fifth. In two additional patients who were not explored, MoAb imaging resulted in definitive therapy to regionally confined recurrent disease. 111In-labeled anti-CEA MoAb ZCE-025 scanning in patients with rising CEA successfully imaged metastatic colorectal cancer that eluded detection by other methods and affected the care given to some. These results suggest an important role for 111In-labeled ZCE-025 scanning among patients with rising CEA and otherwise occult metastatic cancer."}

Five oat cell variants, 14 intermediate variants, and two moderately differentiated tumors were studied with antibodies to cytokeratin, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin (CRG), synaptophysin (SYN), neurofilament, S-100 protein, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and Leu-7. All tumors were immunoreactive for cytokeratin and the majority were also positive for EMA and NSE. Positivity for specific neuroendocrine markers was uncommon, with SYN reactivity noted in one oat cell variant and four intermediate variants, and CRG positivity observed in four intermediate variants and one moderately differentiated tumor. Ultrastructural analysis of four oat cell, eight intermediate, and one moderately differentiated tumor revealed neurosecretory-type, dense-core granules in all lesions, except two oat cell variants studied from paraffin-retrieved material. Hepatic and regional lymph node metastases were noted in five of six oat cell, eight of 16 intermediate, and two of two moderately differentiated tumors. Of 17 patients with follow-up (four oat cell, 11 intermediate, and two moderately differentiated tumors), only two individuals were alive after 1 year. There were no detectable differences in survival or response to treatment between morphologic subtypes. The prognosis of colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma appears worse than for adenocarcinoma of comparable stage. Their distinction is thus warranted, especially in regard to the intermediate variant and moderately differentiated tumors, which may be potentially misinterpreted as forms of adenocarcinoma."}

The second-look laparotomy. Decision-making in medicine is a very complex process that demands input both from the doctor and from the client. From the doctor's point of view, the most important component for this decision concerns the quality of evidence available that the recommended intervention is the best available in terms of both cost and benefit. Good quality evidence demands good quality science. The randomized controlled trial is the expression of this scientific process at work within medical practice. This article reviews both the rationale and the ethics of randomized controlled trials in the epistemology of surgery. The ethical dilemma is accentuated because surgery by its very nature is invasive and often irreversible. As an illustration of the scientific and ethical dilemmas arising out of randomized controlled trials in surgery, a description of the CEA directed second-look laparotomy trial in the United Kingdom is provided. This trial may be judged essential because of the clash of attitudes between surgeons in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is unlikely that the truth lies entirely with one or other national groupings of surgeons, and this randomized trial will eventually resolve a conflict of ideas to the ultimate benefit of all patients with operable colorectal cancer."}

It is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of regional chemotherapy of metastatic liver disease by means of imaging procedures. Therefore it was the aim of this study to find out whether serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) determinations yield reliable data on the therapeutic progress and the individual prognosis of these patients. Since there exists no generally accepted modality to assess CEA curves of patients receiving chemotherapy, we developed our own criterion and tested it in a group of 35 patients. For each patient an individual reference level (CEA-means) was fixed which was obtained as the arithmetical mean of serial CEA values taken during the first three courses of chemotherapy (reference time). On the basis of CEA-means the marker curves of the 35 patients could be divided into two groups. After the reference time the CEA values of group 1 (12 patients) never decreased below CEA-means. Survival of these patients was significantly (P = 0.00001) shorter than that of the 23 patients (group 2) who showed a decrease in their CEA curves below CEA-means after the reference time. Beyond this it could be observed that the improvement in survival was significantly greater in those patients who showed a CEA decrease below CEA-means for a prolonged period (3 months). This difference in prognosis is not an artefact due to different pretherapeutic conditions but is a sign of different responses to therapy. The decrease in CEA values below the individual reference level (CEA-means) is a certain sign of the efficacy of the chosen chemotherapy. A continuous rise of the CEA curve above CEA-means signifies an ineffective intrahepatic chemotherapy or extrahepatic tumor manifestation. In this case an intensive diagnostic workup of the patient and possibly a modification of the therapy are indicated."}

Between 1978 and 1985 a total of 49 patients (20 women and 29 men, aged 31-78 years) were operated upon for liver metastases of a colorectal carcinoma. Metastasis recurrences occurred in 42 of 46 patients (91%). Three patients died in connection with the operation (6.1%). The five-year survival rate was 10.7%. Neither number, site and volume of the metastases, level of carcinoembryonic antigen concentration, tumour differentiation, stage or site of primary tumour, nor type of operation (enucleation or hemihepatectomy) had any influence on survival rate. Since most of the recurrences in the liver had occurred after enucleation at the site of the previous resection, it is feasible that the results could be improved by extending the area of resection."}

Fifteen procedures, including six exploratory laparotomies, four transperineal explorations, two transsacral explorations, one transvaginal biopsy, one brachytherapy, and one transanal polypectomy, were performed. Two patients had previous low anterior resection, seven abdominoperineal resection, and one a rectal polypectomy. Five patients had previous pelvic radiation therapy. Reoperation was indicated by elevated CEA levels in seven patients (70 percent), persistent pelvic pain in six (60 percent), and a suspicious radiologic study in seven (70 percent). RIGS system localized tumors verified by histopatholoy in all ten patients (100 percent); one patient with a positive CT scan and probe findings lacked histopathologic confirmation on frozen section, but had a tumor confirmed on permanent histology. Five major abdominal operations were avoided; in five patients major modifications were made in the surgical procedure based on probe findings. Six received chemotherapy or radiation therapy based on findings of the RIGS system. In six patients with negative or equivocal CT scans, the RIGS system localized histopathologically confirmed tumor. Major abdominal procedures can be avoided, the surgical approach modified, and other modes of therapy instituted earlier with the use of the RIGS system."}

From January 1986 to December 1987, 32 patients with recurrent colorectal cancer had second-look radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS system). All patients had pathologic confirmation of recurrence. The RIGS system identified 81% of recurrences, and in six patients recurrent tumor was identified only by RIGS. All patients had physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay, and computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. Detection of recurrence was based on symptoms in six, elevated CEA value in 25, and physical examination in one. The CEA was elevated preoperatively in 30 patients; two false-negative results occurred in symptomatic patients who had pelvic recurrence. The median CEA value in those with liver recurrence was 30 ng/ml (range 5.2 to 298) and for pelvic recurrence 13 ng/ml (range 1.9 to 31) (P less than .05). The overall sensitivity of CT was 41% (abdomen other than liver 37%, liver 56%, and pelvis 22%). The combination of elevated CEA, symptoms, and physical findings identified 100% of recurrences. We conclude that a rising CEA remains the most accurate indicator of recurrence. CT should not be done routinely to detect recurrent colorectal cancer unless CEA is elevated or the patient is symptomatic. In our study the intraoperative use of the RIGS system aided the surgeon in identifying occult tumors."}

Results of RIS were compared to those of a comprehensive diagnostic study. Final diagnosis was based on surgery, biopsy and autopsy (n = 39) or follow-up findings (n = 18).

Eighty-eight per cent, 93% and 71% of the anatomic regions studied were correctly identified as being involved, and 97%, 97%, and 87% as being free from tumor in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. In the 27 patients from Group C with no definite diagnosis of relapse, and in whom diagnosis was most difficult, 38 tumor sites were involved. Of these, 21 were detected by both prospective RIS and repeated comprehensive study, six by RIS only and seven by conventional methods only. Four sites remained undetected by both approaches. Ten of the 21 lesions were detected by RIS more than 1 mo earlier than by any other method. Among the seven tumor sites detected by other diagnostic modalities only, three were identified at the time of RIS and four became positive more than 6 mo later. Overall diagnosis was entirely correct in 30, partially correct in 16 and incorrect in six patients studied.

All patients presenting increased uptake of fludeoxyglucose F 18 by the mass were proved by histologic studies to suffer from recurrent tumor. Six of seven patients with low fludeoxyglucose uptake had nonmalignant lesions. Using immunoscintigraphy in 14 patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels, only four of ten recurrences could be identified by increased antibody accumulation in the mass. On the other hand, two of four benign lesions were interpreted as being recurrent tumor because of high uptake. Therefore, only positron emission tomography seems to be a useful diagnostic tool in the differentiation of recurrent rectal cancer and scar by providing information about the metabolic activity of a mass."}

Serum level of NCC-ST-439, a new tumor marker, was clinically evaluated in patients with benign and malignant colorectal diseases in comparison with serum CEA and CA 19-9. Fluctuation of serum levels of NCC-ST-439 in patients with colorectal cancers was especially studied. Serum level of NCC-ST-439 was determined by sandwich type NCC-ST-439 EIA kit, which was developed by Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., in 93 cases of primary colorectal cancers, 98 cases of recurrent colorectal cancers and 60 cases of benign colorectal diseases. Positive rate of serum NCC-ST-439 in patients with primary colorectal cancers was 8.6% in Dukes A cases, 14.3% in Dukes B cases, 37.5% in Dukes C cases and 78.9% in Dukes D cases. Positive rate in patients with recurrent colorectal cancers was 42.8%. On the other hand, false positive rate in patients with benign colorectal diseases was 5.0%, which was relatively low in comparison with serum CEA and CA 19-9. While serum NCC-ST-439 was well correlated with serum CEA and CA 19-9 in primary colorectal cancers, NCC-ST-439 value in benign colorectal diseases showed no correlation with serum CEA and CA 19-9. In patients with primary colorectal cancers, curative resection was applied for in 40 cases in which the value recovered to the normal range after resection. In contrast, all 8 cases, which received non-curative resection, showed the increase of serum NCC-ST-439 value. In cases of recurrent colorectal cancers, some cases, which responded against chemotherapy, obviously showed a decrease of NCC-ST-439 value. These facts indicated that serum level of NCC-ST-439 could monitor the clinical effects of surgical treatment, chemotherapy and radiation therapies and it could be used as a marker for colorectal cancers. In conclusion, determination of serum NCC-ST-439 value was clinically useful for the diagnosis and monitoring for patients with colorectal cancers as a new distinct tumor marker."}

There were 120 recurrences (30%), and 100 of them (83%) were detected at scheduled check ups. Initial suspicion of recurrence was most often based on physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen assay, or sigmoidoscopy. Reoperation was undertaken in 62 patients, in 26 cases (22%) for cure. The 5-year survival was 48% after curative reoperations. Metachronous adenomas and carcinomas occurred in 38 and 11 patients, respectively, giving corresponding cumulative 5-year incidences of 13% and 3.8%. Altogether, 37 patients (9.2%) had a curative reoperation for recurrent or metachronous carcinoma, and a further 38 patients (9.5%) had adenomas removed by polypectomy.

In 2 patients examined with the anti CEA antibody (2 mg), a significant decrease of the peripheral leukocyte count could be observed. The recovery rate of the 99mTc antibody labelled granulocytes was calculated to be about 10%. The increase of the antibody-antigen binding was calculated to be 0.2%/min. In vivo the organ distribution curves demonstrated an increase of 99mTc activity over spleen and bone marrow of 1.1%/min, which was interpreted as antigen-antibody reactivity. The organ distribution curves of the anti granulocyte antibody over spleen and bone marrow showed typical binding characteristics to the local granulocyte epitopes. The curves over other organs showed a simple perfusion pattern. The curves of the anti CEA antibody showed a perfusion pattern over all the examined organs. A sham dialysis model in one patient with renal insufficiency undergoing regular dialysis treatment demonstrated the viability of 99mTc antibody labelled granulocytes in vivo.

Investigation of the pathogenesis of human colorectal carcinoma metastasis can be rendered experimentally possible by suitable human cell biological model systems. The purpose of these studies was to establish xenografts in nude mice from human colon carcinoma and from its metastasis in the same patient as an appropriate model. Surgically removed biopsy specimens from a colon adenocarcinoma (grade 3) and its local relapse two years later with metastases in the small intestine were established as xenotransplants and their growth characteristics examined. Both tissue types shared common characteristics with respect to marker expression (carcinoembryonic antigen, neuron-specific enolase, cytokeratin). The primary tumor showed remarkable development of necrotic effusion with cytotoxic activity that ceased after several passages. The profile of endogenous carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins), the receptors for cellular glycoconjugates in a recognitive protein-carbohydrate interplay with potential relevance to metastases formation, revealed differences between these two human tumor samples of identical origin, especially with respect to beta-galactoside-specific receptors. This glycobiochemical analysis employed standardized procedures. Prolonged passaging was also shown to result in profile alterations, as was similarly noted in comparison to another species. These studies may encourage the application of systems of primary tumor and its metastases in the same patient in attempts to correlate the expression of cellular characteristics with the biological and clinical behavior of human colonic tumor cells."}

This prospective study of radioimmunoscintigraphy using 111In-labelled, C46, a monoclonal antibody against carcino embryonic antigen, CEA, was undertaken in 23 patients with colorectal cancer, 18 with primary carcinomas, 3 with recurrences and 2 with metastases. A sensitivity of 95% and an accuracy of 91% was found. New observations through the use of two administered doses of antibody and the analysis of surgical specimens showed that for the low dose of antibody (average 0.76 mg) tumour uptake was 1.14 x 10(-2)% of the injected dose per gram, whereas on the higher dose (average 4.67 mg) the average tumour uptake was 6.77% (same units) p less than 0.01. Thus a six-fold increase of antibody caused a six-fold increase in tumour uptake, but no change was seen in the tumour to mucosa ratio 4.8 +/- 0.5 (low dose) and 4.0 +/- 1.0 (high dose). A further observation was that well and moderately differentiated tumours took up about four times more than poorly differentiated tumours (p less than 0.05). It was also found that tumour free lymph nodes had a six-fold greater uptake than tumour involved nodes (p less than 0.05) confirming other work with anti-CEA monoclonal antibody. In conclusion, although biological factors influence its efficacy, 111In labelled C46 anti-CEA is a suitable radiopharmaceutical for the radioimmunoscintigraphy of colorectal cancer."}

In this study, the \"intrinsic color scale\" (which consists of selecting the limits of the color scale as the highest and the lowest pixel value of the image) was compared to a new, simple algorithm for the determination of the limits of the color scale. This algorithm was based on the count density in the iliac crest areas.

These views are displayed using the two methods and interpreted by two observers. Using their responses in each quadrant of the pelvis, the authors calculated two ROC curves. The comparison of the ROC curves showed better performances for the new method.

This surgical technique has allowed us to readdress the question, \"what is the effectiveness of postoperative radiation therapy when tumoricidal doses can be safely administered to patients with Stage C3 rectal cancer?\" Nineteen consecutive patients with Stage C3 rectal carcinoma underwent resective procedures and simultaneous use of the intestinal sling procedure. Postoperatively, all patients underwent contrast simulation studies that documented the small bowel above the sacral promentory. Tumoricidal doses ranging from 5200 to 5800 cGy (mean, 5600 cGy) were administered in fractionated doses. No patient demonstrated obstruction, infection, nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, or acute RASBI. There have been two locoregional recurrences in a mean follow-up period of 33 months (range, 12 to 54 months) in patients evaluated by physical examination, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, computed axial tomography (CAT) scans, endoscopy, and reoperation or autopsy (P = 0.01). There have been ten distant recurrences (eight liver, one brain, and one lung). Three patients were reoperated on to rule out recurrence at 16, 17, and 24 months. All mesh was resorbed and there were no adhesions and no recurrent tumor. When the intestinal sling procedure is used, tumoricidal doses of radiation therapy can be safely administered without incurring RASBI. Postoperative high-dose radiation therapy can suppress locoregional recurrences in Stage C3 rectal carcinomas over and above what would be expected."}

Over the last few years, many tumor markers have been proposed to clinicians but only a limited number of them meet the necessary criteria to be useful for either screening, diagnosis, prognosis or follow-up of gastrointestinal (GI) tumors. Both CEA and Ca 19-9 have proven to be clinically useful for the detection of recurrent tumors. AFP remains the most useful marker for the follow-up of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its interest for the early detection of primary tumor is debated. Recent data suggest that assays based on monoclonal antibodies to AFP could be used for detection HCC in high risk populations. Decarboxy-prothrombin assay may be a complement to the AFP test in this localization. In addition to GI hormones, serotonin and urinary 5HIAA, Neuron Specific Enolase appears to be a valuable marker for the follow-up of neuroendocrine tumors of the GI tract. Only a few of the new tumor-associated antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies, appear to be promising clinical ly e.g. Ca50 TAG-72, PAO. Monoclonal antibodies to tumor-associated markers have also been used with other techniques: Immunohistochemistry: this technique is useful to the pathologist for the diagnosis of undifferentiated tumors by demonstrating the presence of specific antigens on tissue samples. Immunoscintigraphy: it can be useful for the detection of either metastases of recurrences of colorectal cancer by using anti-ACE antibodies labeled with Iodine 131 iodine 123 or indium 111. However immunoscintigraphy is less sensitive than both ultrasonography and CT scan for localizing hepatic metastases.

Localization of recurrent tumors was successful in 83% using conventional methods versus 57% by immunoscintigraphy. This procedure disappointed especially by a low sensitivity (23%) and low predictive parameters (pos.: 33%; neg.: 37%) in regard to diagnosis of extrahepatic tumors compared to results of conventional methods (77%), 94% respectively 79%). The quote of false positive results was surprisingly high in immunoscintigraphy (n = 12), 83% of these especially in localization of extrahepatic tumors. Therefore, the validity of immunoscintigraphy as an additive diagnostic tool for early detection of recurrent colorectal cancer must be regarded critically."}

In 1978, a prospective program was initiated to evaluate postoperative monitoring of patients after resection of carcinoma of the colon and rectum. The program included clinical examination, interval endoscopy, measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), selected liver function tests (alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase) and roentgenologic testing: roentgenograms of the chest, barium enema, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) and computerized axial tomographic (CAT) scan. Of the initial 226 patients enrolled, 179 had at least one abnormal elevation of the CEA level, and in 70 (39 per cent), recurrence developed. Of the 70 with recurrence, 62 (89 per cent) had elevated CEA levels (greater than 3.0 nanograms per milliliter) prior to detection of recurrence by other means. Eight patients had normal levels (two were false-negative and the other six were tested at inappropriate times). Although other test results often complemented CEA, they were generally less sensitive for early detection. Selective use of these tests frequently documented site and extent of recurrence. The detection sensitivity of these other tests was highest with CAT scan (83 per cent), followed by barium enema and endoscopy (56 and 46 per cent). Forty-five patients underwent re-exploration. Recurrence was found in 42, of whom 23 had resectable disease (five of 11, liver; 17 of 24, local or pelvis, and one of one, lung). In three patients, nothing abnormal was found at exploration; two of these patients ultimately had metastases develop. The median survival time was 43 months and the estimated five year survival rate was 38 per cent. CEA is the best over-all indicator of early recurrence and frequent testing at short intervals is most important. Periodic clinical examination and selected other studies are also essential for early documentation of recurrence. Second-look surgical procedures appear beneficial for survival time in selected patients."}

The results of IS were compared blind with those of computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US). The final diagnosis of recurrence and(or) metastasis was done in 16 cases by second-look surgery and in another patient by rectal biopsy. Overall per-patient sensitivity for the pelvis and extrahepatic abdomen was 69% for IS and 31% and 25% respectively for computed tomography and ultrasonography. No false positive of IS, as well as US and CT, for the pelvis and the extrahepatic abdomen was seen. Based on the number of anatomical sites tested, sensitivity of IS was 91% in the pelvis. In our series, scintigraphic computer subtraction did not allow adequate resolution of the problem of intense liver uptake of 111In-labeled MoAbs.

Patients with pancreatic cancer usually lack signs and symptoms in the early course of the disease. Even when malignancy is suspected, differential diagnosis between benign and malignant pancreatic disorders may be difficult with current methods. An increasing interest has been focused on the utility of immunological tumour markers. CEA has been widely used since the early seventies, but the results in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer have been disappointing. Tumour marker tests for CA 19-9 and CA 50 are based on monoclonal antibodies to colonic carcinoma cell lines. CA 19-9 and CA 50 are strongly expressed in most tissue specimens from pancreatic carcinomas, but are also found in normal pancreas and benign pancreatic diseases. The CA 19-9 and CA 50 antigens are shed or released into the circulation, and are found in increased concentrations in 70-80% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Also 50-65% of patients with small resectable carcinomas have elevated CA 19-9 and CA 50 levels, although very high serum concentrations usually indicate advanced disease. Slightly elevated serum CA 19-9 and CA 50 levels are seen in some patients with benign pancreatic diseases, more often in acute than in chronic pancreatitis. Elevated values are often observed in patients with benign obstruction of the common bile duct, particularly in patients with cholangitis. In patients with jaundice of hepatocellular origin, the CA 19-9 and CA 50 levels are lower than in extrahepatic cholestasis. CA 19-9 and CA 50 have better diagnostic accuracy for pancreatic cancer than CEA, CA 125, DU-PAN-2, TPA and PSTI/TATI. However, the sensitivities and specificities of CA 19-9 and CA 50 are too low for screening of an asymptomatic population. Nevertheless, CA 19-9 and CA 50 have in our experience shown to be useful complements to other diagnostic methods in symptomatic patients with suspicion of pancreatic cancer. Combinations of different markers improve the sensitivity only slightly compared to the use of CA 19-9 or CA 50 alone. Follow-up using CA 19-9 and CA 50 is a simple and sensitive way of monitoring the postoperative course of patients with pancreatic cancer, and may give a lead time of several months for a recurrence compared to conventional methods."}

To determine whether the production of experimental hepatic metastases in athymic nude mice by human colorectal carcinomas (HCC) correlated with the clinical outcome in patients, we harvested colorectal carcinomas from 82 patients, dissociated the tumors with collagenase and DNase, and injected them into groups of nude mice, either in the flank to assess experimental tumorigenicity or into the spleen to produce experimental metastasis in the liver. Growth in mice was then associated with clinicopathological factors and clinical outcome. Growth of HCC in either the flanks or the livers of nude mice was associated with the time to recurrence in a Wilcoxon analysis. Analysis of the outcome data in a Cox proportional hazards model suggested that there was an interaction between tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of HCC in nude mice and serum CEA concentration in the patient and stage of disease. A univariate analysis indicated that both tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of HCC in nude mice were significantly associated with the serum CEA concentration of the patient but not with the other variables of stage of disease, mucin production, local tissue invasion, state of differentiation, or sex. A subset of 57 patients was operated upon for cure and followed prospectively for up to 61 months. Tumorigenicity and, to a lesser extent, experimental metastatic potential were associated with disease recurrence in 23 of these patients. Seventy-eight % of the subset of patients who were operated upon for cure developed liver metastasis as one site of their progressive disease. Thus, the ability of HCC cells isolated from surgical specimens to grow in athymic nude mice correlates with the development of advanced disease in patients."}

One patient presented with synchronous carcinoma and two developed carcinomas 3 and 10 years after excision of Paget's disease. Five patients underwent wide local excision and have not developed cancer (median follow-up 6 years, range 5-13 years). However, four patients developed recurrent Paget's disease. Immunohistochemical studies showed that in general Paget cells stained positively with CAM 5.2 (a cytokeratin marker), gross cystic disease fluid protein (a marker for apocrine cells), human milk fat globule glycoprotein (HMFG 1 and 2) and carcinoembryonic antigen but negatively for PR3A5 (a marker for colonic goblet cells). Three cases had a staining profile which was quite different from that usually observed and these were associated with malignancy. One showed an antigenic profile more typical of a large bowel carcinoma. Paget's disease of the anus appears to run one of two clinical courses: to develop malignancy; or to recur locally, often on repeated occasions. Wide local excision is the treatment of choice but long-term follow-up is necessary because of the cancer risk. An immunohistochemical staining pattern which is different from usual may indicate a higher malignant risk and/or identify some cases of Paget's disease as representing a downward 'pagetoid' extension from a anorectal adenocarcinoma rather than a true epidermotropic apocrine neoplasm of the perianal skin."}

Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of primary colorectal tumour and 68 patients previously operated for colon cancer underwent an immunoscintigraphy carried out with monoclonal antibodies anti-CEA F(ab')2, labelled with 131I or 111In. These studies led to the detection of all primary tumours and of most of their associated lesions (7/8). In this group 15 neoplastic deposits previously undetected were demonstrated, allowing an improvement in the patient staging before the operation. In the group of the 68 operated patients, immunoscintigraphy succeeded in imaging 96 out of 121 known lesions: the best outcomes were obtained for abdominal and pelvic recurrences as well as for lymph nodes lesions. The lowest levels of sensitivity were observed for liver metastases. An enhancement of the immunoscintigraphy sensitivity was obtained when the radiopharmaceutical was injected intraperitoneally. In 50 patients, this alternative administration route was successful in detecting 91/107 cancer deposits and, in particular, liver metastases were found out in 36/42 cases."}

Murine monoclonal antibodies directed against tumour associated antigens are potentially useful in tumour diagnosis and therapy. However, all the antigens they recognise may be heterogeneously expressed on tumours and this may allow escape of cells from therapy if a single monoclonal antibody is used. One approach is to use combinations of monoclonal antibodies recognising complementary cell surface antigens. A flow cytometric method which allows accurate quantitation of the intensity of staining and the percentage of fresh primary tumour cells binding a series of monoclonal antibodies has therefore been developed. This allows calculations as the number of drug molecules which could be potentially delivered by each monoclonal antibody and the optimal combination of antibodies which should be used. Monoclonal antibodies recognising Y hapten (C14), CEA (228, 161) and 791T-p72 antigen (791T/36) have been screened as a possible combination for colorectal cancer. There was inter-tumour variation in the binding of all the monoclonal antibodies although combinations could reduce or abrogate this problem. A combination of the monoclonal antibodies C14, 228, 791T/36 and 161 would recognise 100% of tumours. Sixty per cent of tumours bound all four antibodies, 78% any three, 90% any two and 100% any one antibody. There was also intra-tumour variation in the number of tumour cells per lesion that were recognised, the best monoclonal antibody, 161, stained a mean of 59% of cells per tumour whereas the anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody stained a mean of 74% of cells per tumour. An increased intensity of staining of tumour membranes was observed when a combination of C14 and 228 was used compared to binding of individual antibodies. Furthermore there was still no significant binding to normal colon membranes. Combinations of monoclonal antibodies which recognise a high percentage of tumours are likely to be necessary for monoclonal antibody drug targeting to prevent tumour recurrence and/or metastases."}

In 32 patients with colorectal carcinomas, the immunoreactivity of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was measured on section preparations of the tumours by means of a computer controlled microdensitometric method. By measuring numerous single points, the intensity of the immunohistochemical staining reaction of CEA was evaluated. This method is superior to the commonly used semiquantitative method (+, ++, ) for the assessment of various degrees of staining intensity whenever the antigen to be measured is not homogeneously dispersed in the tissue. The results show that highly differentiated colorectal carcinomas of stage A according to Dukes classification have a lower CEA immunoreactivity than highly differentiated carcinomas of stage B. A correlation between CEA immunoreactivity and degree of malignancy could only be found in patients in stage B. Stage C carcinomas of all degrees of differentiation appeared with a very low CEA immunoreactivity. CEA follow-up controls in our study were of little value for detecting local recurrences; metastases, however, almost always caused an increase in serum CEA titers. Prognostically, a preoperatively increased serum CEA level seems to be as unfavourable as a low CEA immunoreactivity in the tumour."}

This method was applied to human colorectal, gastric, and ovarian carcinomas. It allowed calculations of the number of drug molecules that potentially could be delivered by each MAb as well as selection of the optimal combinations of antibodies for treatment of each type of cancer. The binding of all the MAbs varied among the tumors, although combinations of antibodies reduced this problem. A combination of MAbs C14 and NCRC-23 recognized 97% of colorectal tumors. A combination of C14, NCRC-23, and 791T/36 recognized 95% of gastric tumors. Combinations of either 791T/36 and C14 or 791T/36 and NCRC-11 recognized 80% of ovarian tumors. The number of cells binding with a single MAb varied within the tumor. The optimal anti-colorectal tumor antibody was NCRC-23 (anti-carcinoembryonic antigen), which recognized a mean of 65% of the large cells within a tumor at a mean antigen density of 4.9 X 10(5) sites/cell. The optimal anti-gastric tumor antibody was C14 (anti-Y hapten), which recognized a mean of 66% of the large cells within a tumor at a mean antigen density of 4.4 X 10(5) sites/cell. The optimal anti-ovarian antibody was 115/D8, which recognized 54% of the large cells at a mean antigen density of 4.2 X 10(5) sites/cell. These antigen densities were similar to those calculated for HLA/ABC antigens in colorectal and ovarian cancers. However, the gastric tumors expressed elevated levels of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens, with a mean density of 7.3 X 10(5) sites/cell.

The results of treatment of colorectal cancer have improved little over the last 40 years. This reflects both the advanced age of the patients and the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. Currently, extensive multimodality, periodic evaluation of patients is advocated following potentially curative resections in the hope that colorectal cancer recurrence will be identified when metastases are isolated and curable. Such efforts, however, have failed to make any substantial impact on survival. At this time, the identification of colorectal cancer at an earlier than usual stage appears to be the only means by which survival can be improved. Despite this, substantially more effort and resources are devoted to the postoperative follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer than to the identification of early curable colorectal cancer. In the current economic climate and with limited medical resources, it may be more appropriate to aim primarily at identifying early curable lesions by more routine colonscopy."}

Blood loss as an initial symptom and duration of symptoms were associated with a better prognosis. Location of the primary tumor, age, and sex did not appear to have prognostic value. Observations during operation such as palpable lymph nodes, fixity to adjacent organs, and tumor spill were related to a diminished tumor-free survival. Laboratory data (hemoglobin, leukocytes, ESR, GGTP, SGOT, SGPT, LDH, total protein, CEA) were tested for their potential prognostic values. Only a preoperative low protein level or an elevated CEA level were associated with an increased risk of death due to recurrent tumor.

CA72-4 is a novel quantitative immunoradiometric assay system utilizing two monoclonal antibodies CC-49 and B72.3, which recognize a tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72). We have utilized the CA72-4 RIA kit to measure serum levels of TAG-72 in 205 patients with carcinoma and 192 patients without carcinoma. The cut-off value (4.0 U/ml) was obtained according to the levels and the distribution of CA72-4 in 468 healthy individuals. The positive rates in 82 patients with gastric cancer, 55 with colorectal cancer, 24 with pancreatico-choledochal cancer, 36 with breast cancer, and 3 with ovarian cancer were 52%, 55%, 46%, 39%, and 67%, respectively. Fifty percent of the sera from 205 patients with carcinoma demonstrated increased levels of CA72-4, whereas only 10% of the sera from 192 patients without evidence of malignancy showed levels more than 4.0 U/ml. The average level of serum CA72-4 in the patients with carcinoma was 38.6 U/ml, much higher than that (2.7 U/ml) in patients without malignancy. The patients with gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages or at recurrence showed higher levels of serum CA72-4 than the patients with cancer at early stages. These results thus indicate that CA72-4 is clinically useful as a novel tumor marker, especially for monitoring serum levels of TAG-72 in patients with gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other epithelial malignancies."}

Correlation between CEA and CA19-9 levels of peripheral and draining venous blood, and 12 histopathologic and immunohistochemical variables, was examined in 108 patients with colorectal cancer. CEA levels of draining blood (mean 62.7 ng/ml and positive rate greater than 5 ng/ml, 63.9%) were significantly higher than those (16.3 ng/ml and 31.5%) of peripheral blood. However, CA19-9 levels (mean 576 U/ml and positive rate greater than 37 U/ml, 29.5%) of draining blood were not different from those (568.0 U/ml and 29.5%) of peripheral blood. Histochemically, CEA was observed in all of the 83 specimens and distributed in almost of all cancer cells, although CA19-9 was found in 52 (62.5%) of 83 specimens and focally localized in some part of cancer lesions. Elevation of CEA levels in draining and peripheral blood was most highly correlated with grade of venous invasion and its layer of colorectal wall. While, elevation of CA19-9 levels in both draining and peripheral blood was most highly associated with grade of lymphatic invasion and node metastasis. CEA levels of peripheral blood was negative in 9 (47.4%) of 19 patients with liver metastasis. However, the levels of draining blood was negative only one (5.3%) of these patients and the mean value (273.6 ng/ml) was much greater than that (59.6 ng/ml) of peripheral blood. These results suggest that CEA may be haematogenously drained by the portal system via the draining vein from the cancer cells in the invasive veins, and that CA19-9 may be drained by the thoracic duct of lymphatic system. It is also suggested that the measurement of CEA, especially in draining blood, and CA19-9 may be available to predict the metastasis and/or recurrence of different organs such as the liver, lymph node and so on."}

There is as yet no specific chromosomal abnormality or gene marker identified for colorectal polyps and cancer. Thus available markers include only phenotypic markers. Tumor markers that have been studied include tetraploidy and increased colonic mucosal proliferation; and these markers have identified those patients that are at high risk for colon cancer. The current \"gold standard\" of colorectal cancer markers is the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA is best used as a monitor of disease and recurrence, and not as a screening or diagnostic test. Newer carbohydrate markers include CA 19-9, incompatible A and B antigens, and T and Lewis antigens. These markers have not shown increased specificity or sensitivity compared to CEA. An interesting recently described marker is ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which serves as a simple overall index of colonic mucosal proliferation. Ornithine decarboxylase levels have shown correlation with the progression from normal mucosa to adenoma and carcinoma, especially in hereditary polyposis syndromes. This enzyme may also serve as a potential therapeutic target. Many markers have been found useless in further clinical trials. Ornithine decarboxylase needs to be studied in greater detail to determine its sensitivity and specificity, in patients with hereditary colonic neoplasia and in patients without genetic syndromes."}

To date, chemotherapy is not clearly indicated as adjuvant therapy, but enrollment of patients in cooperative group protocols is recommended. Use of second-look surgery to resect selected recurrent tumors has increased in recent years, in part because of the contribution of the computed tomographic scan and carcinoembryonic antigen assay to follow-up of postoperative patients. For advanced disease, technologic advances have improved the technique of hepatic artery perfusion with chemotherapeutic agents, but evidence of a survival advantage afforded by this method is still lacking. Single-agent chemotherapy with fluorouracil remains the best choice for palliating advanced disease, but hepatic artery perfusion with floxuridine also may relieve liver-dominant disease."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is released from colon cancer cells into the circulation where it is monitored clinically as an indicator of the recurrence or progression of cancer. We have studied the mechanism of CEA membrane attachment and release using the human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line LS-174T, specimens of human colon cancers, and serum from colon cancer patients. CEA release by cells in vitro and in vivo is associated with the conversion of CEA from a membrane-bound, hydrophobic molecule to a soluble, hydrophilic form with no apparent decrease in molecular mass. When LS-174T cell membranes were incubated with various buffers, proteases, and phospholipases, the only agents that released CEA and converted it to the hydrophilic form were preparations of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Both [3H]ethanolamine and [3H]palmitate could be incorporated metabolically into CEA but only palmitate was released by treatment with PI-PLC, consistent with the presence of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. PI-PLC treatment also release significant quantities of CEA from living monolayers and from seven human colon cancer specimens. These experiments suggest that cellular CEA is anchored to membranes by a covalent linkage to a membrane phosphatidylinositol molecule, and that an endogenous phospholipase may be important for releasing CEA in vitro and in vivo."}

The median postoperative follow-up was 18 months (range: 4-45 months). Survival rate was calculated by the actuarial method, and statistical significance was tested by the Mantel-Haenszel test. Twenty-eight patients had a relapse. These recurrences were hepatic in 11 patients, extrahepatic (intra- and extra-abdominal) in 12 patients, and intra- and extrahepatic in five patients: The stage (classification of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan) was the most important parameter related to the overall recurrence rate (47% in stage I, 62% in stage II, and 81% in stage III) and to the overall and disease-free survival. Stage was significantly related to hepatic relapse but not to extrahepatic relapse. In stage I the failure rate of 18 months was similar in hepatic and extrahepatic relapses (one third to one fourth of the patients); in stages II and III the hepatic failure rate was always higher than the extrahepatic rate. These data indicate that surgery alone is an inadequate form of therapy in cases of colorectal cancer metastases of the liver, and an adjuvant therapy, including alternate regimens of intraperitoneal and systemic chemotherapy, should be considered."}

In five of the nine patients receiving F(ab')2, the tumor site could be visualized, yielding a sensitivity of 55%. No tumor sites were identified with MAB. The highest tumor uptake was recorded in a patient with additional ovarian cancer with the activity accumulating in the ovarian cancer. The optimum time for imaging was 3 or 4 days after injection. There was no correlation between positive imaging and plasma CEA levels which ranged from 1.9 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml in the positive cases.

In the ND group, however, only one of eight recurrences was preceded by a rise in CEA level; the one with elevation also had increased plasma CEA prior to operation. It thus seems that a low CEA output of ND tumors explains many of the \"false-negative\" CEA measurements in disseminated cases.

The present study was done in order to examine if the use of 111In-DTPA-labeled MAb fragments in place of 131I-labeled MAb fragments increases the sensitivity of tomographic immunoscintigraphy to reach the level of that of planar imaging techniques. In 11 patients with various primary tumors, local recurrences or metastases [colorectal carcinoma (n = 7), ovarian carcinoma (n = 2), papillary thyroid carcinoma (n = 1), undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung (n = 1)], immunoscintigraphy (IS) was carried out using 111In-DTPA-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of various MAbs (anti-CEA, OC 125, anti-hTG) and planar and tomographic imaging were compared intra-individually. By conventional diagnostic procedures, the presence of a tumor mass was confirmed (transmission computer tomography, ultrasound) or verified (131I whole-body scintigraphy, histology) in all cases. Immunoscintigraphy was positive in 9 out of 11 cases by ECT and in 10 out of 11 cases by planar imaging. When using 111In-labeled MAb fragments, intra-individual comparison of ECT and planar imaging resulted in a similar sensitivity. The increased sensitivity of ECT using this tracer in contrast to 131I-labeled MAb fragments may be attributed to the fact that the physical properties of 111In are much more suitable for the gamma cameras most commonly used (single detector, 3/8'' crystal); using 111In-labeled MAb fragments, count rates sufficient for ECT can be obtained within a reasonable acquisition time. This allows to combine IS with the advantages of ECT regarding tumour localization and prevention of artefacts due to superposition of background."}

CEA is more sensitive than CA 19-9 in all stages of carcinoma of the stomach and colon/rectum. During treatments of gastrointestinal carcinomas, CEA and CA 19-9 were determined at the same time in 66 and 165 patients with surgically treated carcinoma of the stomach and colorectal carcinoma, respectively.

Sixty-four consecutive patients who had undergone curative resection for colorectal carcinoma were studied prospectively to evaluate the roles of sequential CEA determinations and independent instrumental follow-up in the early detection of resectable recurrences. Fifty-two of these patients also were submitted to sequential determinations of other tumor antigens: TPA (tissue polypeptide antigen) and Ca 19-9 (colon cancer antigen detected with a monoclonal antibody), for a retrospective evaluation of their utility as markers of recurrent tumors. Twenty-two recurrences were detected in a period ranging from 12 to 72 months (median, 47 months). CEA was the best predictor of recurrence (sensitivity, 90 percent) when compared with the other two markers (TPA sensitivity, 60 percent; Ca 19-9 sensitivity, 20 percent). When compared with the instrumental or biochemical examinations of the follow-up, CEA was still the most sensitive indicator of relapse although the specificity was quite low (78 percent) if minimal significative increases were considered. History and physical examination were more useful than CEA in detecting local recurrences in rectal cancer where the preoperative CEA level was low. A few second-look explorations based solely on small CEA increases failed to demonstrate recurrence or revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis. Selected second-look surgery based on demonstrated recurrences resulted in a resectability rate of 57 percent. A follow-up program based on frequent CEA assays, history, and physical examinations, including rectal, vaginal, and perineal exploration, is proposed. Extensive instrumental investigations should follow when a minimal significative CEA rise is observed, or when history and physical examinations suggest a possible recurrence. Second-look surgery should be evaluated after confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of recurrence, on the basis of instrumental or clinical examinations."}

While cell surface antigens restricted to cancer cells have not yet been identified, a number of antigens have been described which are present in greater amounts in association with cancer cells. CEA is present on the cell surface of the majority of colorectal cancers and is released into the serum where it can be used to monitor for disease recurrence. The presence of CEA on the cell surface can be used to localise the site of tumour recurrence by antibody/isotope conjugate scanning. A fall in serum CEA after treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy can be used to predict patients whose survival will be prolonged by the chemotherapy. As more effective treatments of disseminated colorectal carcinoma are developed, serum CEA may play an increasing role in monitoring response to treatment."}

B The greater use of sphincter-saving types of excision for growths of the middle and lower parts of the rectum. To this end several new techniques of rectal resection have become popular--especially the downward extrusion of low anterior resection with the aid of the circular stapler. In addition, for small very favourable low growths local excision or local destruction by diathermy fulguration or contact irradiation have been employed. The rationale and success of these two forms of endeavour are examined."}

Eighteen of 20 documented tumor sites, excluding those in the liver, were detected with In-111 ZCE-025. Lesions less than 1.5 cm could not be detected. Twenty-five percent of liver metastases exhibited positive accumulation of In-111 ZCE-025 at doses of 40-80 mg. No side effects were encountered. Because of the high detection rate of lymph node metastases from colorectal carcinoma with In-111 ZCE-025, this technique may be helpful in preoperative staging of patients with colorectal tumors, as well as in distinguishing recurrent tumors from postoperative or postradiation changes seen on computed tomography scans or other radiologic images."}

The overall sensitivity to four anticancer agents examined (5-FU, MMC, CPA and CDDP) was relatively insignificant. The heterogeneity of chemosensitivity among primary, metastatic and recurrent lesions of the same patient was demonstrated. A tumor line obtained from poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showed better responses to 3 of 4 agents. Tumor doubling time evaluated as an indicator of tumor growth rate showed a significant correlation with sensitivity to MMC. The time also showed a tendency to correlate with sensitivity to CDDP. The tumor with shorter tumor doubling time presented had more remarkable sensitivity to such agents. Similar correlation was observed in the mucus secretion shown by Alcian-blue (AB) staining and sensitivity to MMC and CDDP. Tumors with less significant AB staining showed more remarkable sensitivity to these agents. The productivity of CEA revealed a tendency to correlate with sensitivity to MMC and CPA.

In this group the CEA time courses of 103/201 patients with recurrent disease exhibited an exponential increase of the serum CEA concentration, i.e. a linear relationship of log CEA and time, which allowed the calculation of the CEA doubling time.

The tumor cell lines were WiDr, SW403, and LS174T, human colon cancer derivatives. The murine breast carcinoma cell line EMT-6 was used as a control. Tumor CEA levels (ng/g of tumor +/- standard error of the mean [SEM], measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were: EMT-6, 0; WiDr, 105 +/- 5.7; LS174T, 2052 +/- 198; SW403, 17,575 +/- 1,785. The 111In-labeled monoclonal antibody was injected intravenously into mice bearing a single tumor. At 48 hours postinjection, scintiscan was performed, and the mice were killed so that biodistribution studies could be performed. The uptake of the monoclonal antibody was expressed as percent injected counts per minute per gram of tissue +/- SEM. The non-CEA-producing tumor, EMT-6, showed the lowest tumor uptake (1.4 +/- 0.3). WiDr, an intermediate CEA-producing tumor, showed some tumor uptake (16.4 +/- 1.5). The high CEA-producing tumors, SW403 and LS174T, had high tumor uptake (29.5 +/- 5.0 and 51.1 +/- 6.1, respectively). Biodistribution and scintiscan quality were closely related. Although LS174T had the best tumor uptake, SW403 had the highest CEA tumor content, indicating tumor CEA content cannot entirely predict scintiscan and biodistribution results. Tumor-to-blood (T/B), tumor-to-liver (T/L), and liver-to-blood (L/B) ratios were calculated for each animal and compared with tumor size.

Both assays showed a similar number of 'false-negative' CEA levels pre-operatively--varying from 69% in aneuploid (AN) Dukes' A to 8% in AN Dukes' D tumours, and from 75% in near diploid (ND) Dukes' A to 40% in ND Dukes' D tumours. The sensitivity for detecting recurrence in patients with tumours of either ploidy pattern was slightly better with EIA than with RIA. A difference between the AN and ND group was shown somewhat better with RIA, the sensitivity in the AN group being 79% and the median lead time 7 months compared to 13% and 2 months in the ND group.

Polyamine levels were increased in all three groups in the early postoperative period. Urinary polyamine excretion did not correlate with serum CEA levels, tumor volume, or stage of disease in patients with cancer.

In this case the five-year survival rate after a second operation was 44%, compared with 6%, if the test was positive. Radical second operation was associated with a negative CEA test in 70% of cases. The five-year survival rate after second operation in stage rT1-3 N0M0 was 26%. Patients who had regular follow-ups survived the second operation with a five-year survival rate of 11%, none survived who had been without medical follow-up. Five-year survival rate of 16% was achieved by the group of patients who were symptom-free; none with symptomatic recurrence survived. Other prognostically favourable factors were: male sex; tumour localized to the ascending colon; onset in the fifth decade; long recurrence-free interval; and early stage of the tumour at first operation."}

Patients with primary, recurrent, or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma were given injections of 200 micrograms of anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monoclonal antibody labeled with 2 mCi of 111In (Indacea). Patients were imaged at 24 and 48 h. Celiotomy was performed on 40 patients between 3 and 17 days post-Indacea injection. Of 16 primary tumors, 11 (69%) were imaged. Of six extrahepatic recurrences, none was imaged. Intrahepatic metastases were visualized as negative images in 10 of 24 (42%) patients. On the basis of the activity in tissue expressed as a percentage of the total radioactive dose per kg injected into the patient (% ID/kg), extrahepatic tumors that were imaged using Indacea had a significant uptake of radiolabel in the tumor [5.99 +/- 0.91% ID/kg (SE)] and in the associated normal mesenteric lymph nodes (12.0 +/- 2.4% ID/kg). The CEA content of these tumors was high (13.3 +/- 4.7 micrograms/g), and, histologically, the CEA was located primarily apically or intraluminally. Intrahepatic tumor imaging correlated only with tumor size. The greatest Indacea uptake was seen in normal liver (22.1 +/- 3.2% ID/kg). Low Indacea uptake was seen in fat (0.21 +/- 0.05% ID/kg) and bowel wall (1.11 +/- 0.17% ID/kg). In conclusion, Indacea imaging of colorectal carcinoma is specific for high concentrations of accessible CEA in CEA-bearing tumors or in lymph nodes draining these tumors. The successful clinical use of monoclonal antibodies for tumor imaging and therapy will require careful selection of patients for a number of antigen-related parameters including antigen content and distribution in tumors. This information will only come from careful correlation between image results and tissue analysis. High uptake by normal liver tissue is the major unresolved problem with labeled antibody imaging."}

To evaluate the usefulness of serial postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays, seven previously published decision rules for predicting tumor recurrence were compared retrospectively using CEA values from 214 patients followed 36 to 120 months after surgery for colorectal carcinoma. Decision rules employing cutoff values to predict tumor recurrence were found inadequate for the asymptomatic patient. This attenuation of prognostic usefulness appeared attributable to inadequacies of CEA assays for predicting late recurrences. From these analyses, elevated CEA results without other objective evidence might be insufficient to justify second-look surgery. In addition, late recurring tumors tended not to cause elevated CEA levels."}
{"id": "3742993", "title": "Diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer.", "content": "Diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is an important disease with high mortality. Clinical features are usually nonspecific and vary with the location of the tumor. Diagnosis depends on colonic investigations initiated by a high index of clinical suspicion. Rectal examination, sigmoidoscopy, air-contrast barium enema, and colonoscopy are the crucial diagnostic tools. Clinical judgment dictates the extent of work-up in individual symptomatic patients. Screening of asymptomatic middle-aged and elderly persons is widely advised but less widely practiced. More evidence is needed to clarify the value of screening, especially by occult blood testing. CEA testing is unsuitable for screening and of only limited value for monitoring patients with known colorectal cancer. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. Radiotherapy is useful for palliation of rectal cancer and may delay postoperative tumor recurrence. Chemotherapy for disseminated disease generally gives disappointing results, since only a minority of tumors respond and survival benefit is marginal. Periodic colonic surveillance is important after tumor resection, primarily to detect premalignant new growths."}

Pelvic computed tomography examination is very valuable for the early detection and localization of recurrence in relation to pelvic structures and can also serve as a guide in percutaneous needle biopsy of the tumor. Seven patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions underwent pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. The ileal segment conduit was used for ureteral urinary diversion. The mean operation time and blood loss were 8.8 hours and 6,200 ml, respectively. No operative deaths were encountered. One patient is alive 22 months postoperatively with no evidence of disease, and another patient is alive 32 months postoperatively with pelvic wall recurrence.

Since 1978, our policy has been to examine the colon annually in these patients using colonoscopy alternating with barium enema. We have evaluated the results in 100 patients over a four-year period. Based on size and histology, the significant colonoscopic findings were new colon cancers in three patients and 11 polyps demonstrating increased risk for malignancy in nine patients.

The prognostic value of serial CEA tests was evaluated in 175 consecutive patients with progressive colorectal cancer who subsequently died of their disease. The upper normal plasma CEA limit was determined to be 8 ng/ml from serial CEA determinations in 31 patients radically operated on for colorectal cancer and observed in median 40 months without evidence of recurrence. A CEA value of greater than 8 ng/ml was highly suggestive of residual disease or recurrence, even when no clinical evidence was present. Approximately 90% of the patients dying from colorectal cancer showed an increase in CEA to greater than 8 ng/ml during the course of the disease. In 63% of the patients CEA increase preceded clinical progression or relapse, with a median time period of 4 months. Sixty-eight per cent of the patients had rising CEA values over an extended time period of many months, 14% had a preterminal increase, 13% had constantly normal and 5% constantly elevated CEA. As 6/9 patients developed a drop in CEA in relation to initiation of chemotherapy without clinical response, it is concluded that CEA is not a reliable indicator of clinical response to chemotherapy. Patients with liver metastases had higher CEA and alkaline phosphatase levels than patients with only localized disease. However, no good statistical correlation between CEA and serum alkaline phosphatase was found in patients with liver metastases (coefficient of correlation r = 0.35). An increase in CEA from normal to above 8 ng/ml predicted a decrease in survival time of median 60% counted from the time of diagnosis. The numerical CEA value was predictive of shortening of survival only when greater than 3000 ng/ml. Such high values were observed only in a minority of the patients (12%). Greater than 1000 U/l (27% of the patients) alkaline phosphatase predicted an extremely poor prognosis, with a median survival of 1 month (range 0.5-4 months). It is concluded that a rise in CEA to greater than 8 ng/ml indicates with high degree of certainty relapse or disease progression in colorectal cancer patients. CEA is not a reliable indicator of clinical response to chemotherapy, and an increase in the CEA level is of little prognostic value concerning survival. Alkaline phosphatase seems to be a more valuable predictor of a worsening of prognosis."}

This article reviews the clinical usefulness of this observation. Carcinoembryonic antigen is not useful for detecting asymptomatic cancer; its sensitivity and specificity are not high, particularly for early stages of disease, so in populations with low prevalence of disease there are many false-positive and false-negative results. Similarly, the antigen level cannot, by itself, provide enough diagnostic certainty to confirm or rule out suspected cancer. For some cancers, antigen levels at the time of diagnosis provide more precise prognosis than staging alone, but this information does not lead to more effective treatment. Serial measurement of CEA levels after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer can detect recurrences early, but few lives can be saved by this approach. Thus, CEA assays provide accurate information about some aspects of cancer but rarely lead to better outcomes for patients."}

Mitomycin C and FUDR combination was substituted after progression or when response had peaked. Chemotherapy was delivered with an Infusaid pump (Infusaid Corp; Norwood, Mass; 14 patients), Medtronic programmable drug administration device (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis; two patients), or percutaneously placed catheters (13 patients). Complete disappearance of liver metastases was observed in four patients and 11 additional patients had a partial remission as determined by computed tomography (CT) scan and substantiated at times by angiography, for a total response rate of 52%. Response as determined by imaging techniques coincided with a concurrent decrease in carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and improvement in performance status. The severity of tumor burden was correlated with the response to therapy and survival. Among those patients who responded to arterial chemotherapy, differences in disease severity did not significantly influence survival. Median survival among responders with greater than 25% liver replacement by tumor was 14 months (P = .28), compared with 28 months for those patients with less than 25% liver replacement. In contrast, differences in tumor burden significantly affected survival among patients who failed to respond to chemotherapy; median survival among nonresponding patients with greater than 25% liver replacement was 4 months, compared with 8 months for those who had less than 25% liver replacement (P = .01). The presence of minimal extrahepatic disease at the time of initiation of intraarterial treatment did not seem to have a significant detrimental effect on survival. The study suggests that hepatic tumor response to arterial administration of CDDP and FUDR and mitomycin C and FUDR is clinically significant because it overrides the effect of tumor burden on survival among patients who have colorectal cancer with liver metastases and may offer effective palliation."}

Initial CA 19-9 levels were greater than or equal to 37 U/mL in 22 of the 53 patients (41%) and in 68% of the patients with metastatic disease. Similar trends of serial CA 19-9 and CEA levels were found in 79% of the 53 patients. One patient with initially normal CEA levels had elevated CA 19-9 levels from the start. In ten of the 53 patients (19%), serial CA 19-9 levels remained low despite tumor recurrence or progression, and despite increasing CEA levels above 5 ng/mL. The increasing serial CEA trends predicted recurrence in 88% and increasing CA 19-9 trends in 50% of cases, which was increased to 70% by including trends of CA 19-9 levels below 37 U/mL. Following hepatic lobectomy, both serial CEA and CA 19-9 levels decreased rapidly. Used alone, serial CA 19-9 levels did not appear to be as sensitive as standard CEA in this retrospective study of selected patients."}

Preoperative evaluation included determination of serum carcinoembryonic antigen, barium enema, colonoscopy, chest film, computerized axial tomography, liver, spleen, and bone scans, and endoscopy when indicated. Preoperative whole-body imaging correctly localized primary tumors in only 33 percent of the patients, whereas it correctly demonstrated tumor in 64 percent of those with recurrent disease.

Postoperatively, carcinoembryonic antigen was localized in tissues with the avidin-biotin peroxidase staining technique to confirm intraoperative readings. Variations in stain uptake in a patient could be correlated with variations in radiation detector readings in the same patient.

Involvement of the liver by carcinoma was less than 50 per cent in 16 and more than 50 per cent in 14 patients. The results of follow-up examinations, LFT, CEA and CT scan studies showed more than 50 per cent regression of the tumor and a decrease in alkaline phosphatase values and CEA in 29 patients (97 per cent); six had complete regression of tumor. The duration of response ranged from five to 39 months with the median of 17 or more months. The results of sequential LFT showed immediate increase in liver enzymes with return to normal in seven to 14 days. The mean CEA value decreased by 69 per cent within the first week and further decreased by 88 per cent in two months at the end of infusion chemotherapy.

In order to select good candidates for this extensive procedure, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assays and the diagnosis of locally recurrent tumor with pelvic computed tomography (CT) were evaluated. CEA assay is valuable for diagnosing most recurrent rectal cancers, but it is inadequate for early detection. A high CEA level often indicates extrapelvic tumor spread.

In our study of patients with resected primary gastrointestinal cancer, slope analysis of the post-operatively increasing carcinoembryonic antigen time courses signaled relapse in about 80 percent of the patients up to 12 months before positive clinical diagnosis. In 29 patients, clinical confirmation of the relapse could be obtained only after second-look surgery. Slope analysis generally differentiated localized from metastatic disease and therefore also predicted the site of relapse. A first evaluation of 84 patients with potential cases of second-look operations provided evidence for a significant increase in survival. Recently, the evaluation of individual carcinoembryonic antigen doubling times was used to derive an individual prognosis since doubling times strongly correlated with the survival of untreated patients. On this basis, it was clearly possible to show the benefit of second-look operation, since patients with resectable recurrences exhibited longer survival times compared with patients with similar carcinoembryonic antigen doubling times without treatment. Moreover, the introduction of monoclonal antibodies with increased specificity for malignant states, has facilitated the selection of patients for second-look operation because unspecific carcinoembryonic antigen elevations are less frequent and recurrent disease can be predicted more reliably due to the higher carcinoembryonic antigen increments associated with malignant growth."}

Seven cases were detected at clinical follow-up and six cases due to symptoms suggestive of recurrence. The predictive value of a positive test was 79.4% for CEA but very low for the other tests studied. A negative value for any of the tests in the battery was usually accurate.

Because of high false positive and false negative percentages in normal populations, it has not been useful in screening for malignancy. However, in several types of cancer patients the test has been shown to be of considerable clinical value. Elevated CEA levels indicate a poor prognosis in patients with primary colorectal cancer, primary pancreatic cancer, primary breast cancer, and primary lung cancer. Serial CEA titers obtained following cancer treatments can be used to monitor the therapy. CEA can assess the adequacy of surgical removal of a primary colon or rectal cancer, monitor responses to chemotherapy, and assess response to radiation therapy. The greatest clinical impact of CEA has been in the detection of recurrent colon or rectal cancer following surgical resection of the primary malignancy. Early detection of recurrence, when combined with reoperative second-look surgery, may result in 30% long-term survivors."}

The EIA assay could be performed in samples of serum and plasma with compatible results. The correlation between the EIA and RIA values was different in different diagnostic groups, with high correlation in colo-rectal cancer, and low in non-malignant diseases, in which the EIA assay had a lower frequency of CEA positive values. In colo-rectal cancer the RIA assay shows a 20% specificity improvement compared with the EIA assay. This was also reflected in better predictability for true positive and true negative cancer diagnosis in this group of patients as well as increased ability to discriminate between malignant and non-malignant diseases. In other groups of patients, like lung cancer and uterine cervical cancer, such improvement was not seen. The discrimination between malignant and non-malignant diseases was comparable to that of the RIA assay.

Among digestive system cancers, elevated levels were found in 18.2% of 11 patients with esophageal cancer, 42.7% of 68 patients with gastric cancer, 39.1% of 23 patients with colorectal cancer, 27.8% of 18 patients with primary hepatic cancer, 71.4% of 35 patients with biliary cancer, and 75% of 20 patients with pancreatic cancer. Most of the patients with levels above 100 U/ml had carcinomatous diseases. The CA19-9 positive rates for patients with gastric cancer and colorectal cancer were extremely low at stages I, II and III, while in patients at stage IV and in patients with recurrent cancer, a tendency for rapid increase in the positive rates and concentrations of CA19-9 was noted. Based on combination assay of CA19-9, CEA and ferritin, in comparison with the positive rates for CA19-9 alone, it was found that the rates were raised to 42.7% in gastric cancer, to 39.1% in colorectal cancer, and to 71.4% in biliary cancer, suggesting the simultaneous determination with these tumor markers may serve to elevate their usefulness."}

The clinical validity of monitoring the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 were investigated in 602 patients with colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic carcinomas. Sensitivity and specificity of the tests were evaluated preoperatively as well as in the postoperative follow-up for early detection of disease progression and recurrence. At a 95% level of specificity as calculated from a group of 150 patients with benign diseases, the CEA test with monoclonal antibody had a preoperative sensitivity of 39% in colorectal cancer and 21% in gastric cancer. On the other hand, CA 19-9 had a sensitivity of 19% in colorectal cancer, 21% in gastric cancer, and 89% in pancreatic cancer. In the postoperative follow-up it was found that a combination of both tumor marker tests was most profitable in gastric carcinomas, yielding an increase of sensitivity from 59%-94%, showing a high degree of complementarity. The gain in sensitivity provided by the CA 19-9 test over the CEA-test in colorectal cancer was very low. The gain in sensitivity, however, provided by the CEA test over the CA 19-9 test in pancreatic carcinoma was also very low. On the basis of these results it has to be recommended that cases with pancreatic carcinoma are to be monitored most efficiently with the CA 19-9 test, whereas in cases with colorectal cancer the CEA test should be used primarily. However, in gastric cancer the combined use of CEA and CA 19-9 represents a highly valuable basis for monitoring the course of disease."}

A significant increase in disease recurrence risk is observable starting from a preoperative CEA value of greater than 7.5 ng/ml; corresponding values as such are verified by a significant fall in the actuarial survival curve in comparison to the progress of the curves of the other two groups with lower CEA values. A statistically significant correlation between preoperative CEA and staging was not observed, while both parameters result statistically very reliable (p less than 0.001) for prognosis; preoperative CEA values, less or greater than 7.5 ng/ml can help to stratify the Dukes tumours with respect to the probability of recurrence."}

Seventeen of the 21 patients had failed previous radiation therapy and 15 had also failed systemic intravenous chemotherapy. Eighteen of the 21 patients received intra-arterial treatments because of pelvic pain. Effect of this treatment on the pain could be evaluated in 16 patients. A measurable decrease in pain medication occurred in 8 of 16, whereas a subjective feeling of pain relief was observed in 12 of 16 patients for a mean period of 3.5 months. However, objective tumor response was considered definite only if associated with a greater than 50% decline of an elevated plasma carcinoembryonic antigen level; this was observed in 5 of 11 patients (45%). Reduction in tumor mass as measured by imaging techniques was observed in two of ten patients in whom it was evaluable. Improvement in hydronephrosis was observed in five of seven evaluable patients. Hematuria was present in 12 patients and improved in 10 of those patients. The most significant side effect of chemotherapy was perineal and gluteal skin erythema, which was observed in 36% of the patients after the first course and in 24% during the second course. This frequently escalated to cutaneous vesiculation and desquamation. This side effect was prevented by concurrent administration of steroids. Pelvic arterial infusion of 5-FU and mitomycin C can offer temporary pain relief to patients who have failed other means of therapy. Objective antitumor effects may have also resulted but were much harder to assess in this group of patients."}

The evaluation of serial plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels is one of the most important parameter used to establish the prognosis of surgically cured colorectal cancer patients. Carcinoembryonic antigen is particularly useful in the identification of recurrences and metastasis. However, to improve the usefulness of this assay, it would be helpful to accurately determine, if possible, those patients whose cancers produce CEA. The evaluation of the presence of CEA in these cancer specimens by means of immunoperoxidase staining technique does seem to improve the sensitivity of the CEA test. Fifty-seven patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgical treatment were studied. Tissue CEA evaluation was correlated with the plasma CEA levels, the pathologic stage and grade, and histologic type of the cancers. Results demonstrate that 66.6% of Dukes' B cancers, 78.9% of Dukes' C, and 77.7% of Dukes' D cancers stained positively for CEA by immunoperoxidase. Thirty of 57 patients with preoperative pathologic plasma CEA levels had positive tissue CEA, whereas 8/57 patients did not. Of patients with a well-differentiated cancer (G1), 81.4% had positive tissue CEA versus the 64% of G2 and 60% of G3 cancers. The authors conclude that the use of the immunoperoxidase stain to measure CEA in tissue, so that the CEA serum assay may be used in those patients known to produce CEA, results in a major increase in the sensitivity of the test."}

Serial serum samples were assessed for the tumor-associated antigens, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the gastrointestinal cancer antigen CA 19-9. Computed axial tomographic (CAT) scans were made to assess the size of the hepatic metastasis. In 9/10 of these patients the CEA predicted tumor response within 2-6 weeks after initiation of treatment, and in 7/10 the information was supported or more dramatically demonstrated by the CA 19-9. Combining data from both tumor markers may provide a more accurate assessment of the clinical response than one antigen alone. Recurrence of hepatic metastatic growth or extrahepatic tumor also was identified by elevation of one or both circulating tumor-associated antigens prior to other laboratory or clinical evidence of tumor growth."}

Sixteen tumor markers are reviewed, and measured to the ideal: produced by the tumor cell alone absent in health and in benign disease present in all patients with a given malignancy level in the blood representative of tumor mass detectable in occult disease. The only marker that approaches the ideal is human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in gestational trophoblastic tumors. In this malignancy, the HCG level suggests the diagnosis and stage, confirms response to therapy, and predicts relapse. The three most widely used and intensely studied tumor markers are carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alphafetoprotein (AFP), and HCG. CEA cannot be used in screening for cancer, but in carcinoma of the colon its elevation preoperatively increases the likelihood of advanced disease and postoperative recurrence. Postoperatively, elevated titers are often but not invariably associated with recurrent disease. AFP and HCG are useful in the management of nonseminomatous germ cell testicular tumors. Like CEA, they cannot be used for screening. They are more likely to be increased with advancing stage, and after therapy rising levels almost always mean recurrent disease. Some markers are valuable in specific circumstances, such as calcitonin in screening for familial medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. In multiple myeloma, immunoglobulins are useful in determining the tumor mass and response to therapy. In neuroblastoma, catecholamine metabolites are useful primarily in making the diagnosis. In some malignancies, the absence of effective therapy lowers the value of the marker, as for AFP in hepatoma. The remaining markers are too unreliable or too little studied to be useful in the management of an individual patient with cancer. The purpose of this paper is to provide the clinician with an understanding of the limitations of the present tumor markers that will lead to wiser use of the tests, and to provide standards to which future tumor markers should be measured."}

Six patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions were subjected to pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. No postoperative deaths were encountered. The postoperative sharp drops of serum CEA levels are useful for judging the adequacy of this procedure. The follow-up status of the 6 patients is as follows, respectively: 16 months dead from pulmonary & hepatic metastasis, 11 months and 9.5 months alive without symptoms but with slightly elevated CEA level, and 5 months, 2 months and 2 weeks alive with no evidence of disease. All patients who were relieved of perineal or sciatic nerve pain are now able to walk without any assistance or trouble.

Eight lesions were metachronous, and three were synchronous. All lesions except three metachronous lesions were solitary nodules. Patients who were found to have metachronous lesions were initially evaluated because of rising carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. One postoperative death occurred (9% mortality). All patients with synchronous lesions have since died for a mean survival of 15.2 months. The mean survival for patients with metachronous lesions, excluding the postoperative mortality, was 15.4 months (range, 4.1-30.7 months). The 1-year and 2-year actuarial survival rates are 79 per cent and 33 per cent. Five patients are alive, and three are free of clinical disease; therefore survival is expected to improve.

The Dukes' and TNM systems for staging carcinoma of the colon and rectum are still the best pathologic classifications, but they do not apply to all patients and do not distinguish between patients who will die and patients who will be cured by the same therapeutic procedure. A new approach to this problem should be to establish a biochemical automatic classification, complementary to the morphologic one, which allow us to classify every patient before and after the first and subsequent treatments. By using several nonspecific tumor markers, such as CEA, AAT, AF, AAG, GGT and transferrine, a discriminant analysis was executed among the groups of patients with LD, RD and DD. Our initial results with only 12.8 per cent of incorrect classifications, that is patients classified in a less advanced group, suggest that this system may be quite useful in order to select those patients with carcinoma of the rectum who should benefit from preoperative radiotherapy as well as those who should receive adjuvant therapy after the first treatment. On the other hand, for patients classified in a more advanced group than the pathologic grading, we may well be able to identify those patients with occult disease for which the frequency of revisions should be shorter."}

In the United States, there are an estimated 5000 to 6000 new patients annually who might be candidates for major hepatic resection to treat their recurrent colon cancer. Since 1971, the program reported here has evaluated various factors that might influence the curative potential of such an approach. Sixty-five patients had a major hepatic resection from March 1971 through May 1982. Using a stepwise proportional hazard analysis, all data that had been stored in CLINFO (a data analysis system by Bolt, Beranek and Newman; Boston, MA) were evaluated for the effect of multiple variables on the survival of patients with resected hepatic metastases. Twenty-seven had a right hepatic lobectomy; 14 had extended right hepatectomy with one having the caudate lobe also removed; ten had left lobectomy, nine had left lateral segmentectomy; and five had a major hepatic resection with three-dimensional wedge excision of a metastatic deposit in the contralateral lobe. The 30-day operative mortality rate was 7% (4/58) for patients undergoing the standard major hepatic resection. It was 14% for seven patients in whom the isolation-hypothermic perfusion technique was used early in the series. In ten patients, wedge excision only was required to remove the tumor. Stage I disease is defined as tumor confined to the resected portion of the liver without invasion of major intrahepatic vessels or bile ducts. Stage II disease is regional spread and Stage III disease is metastasis to lymph nodes or extraregional sites. The 3-year survival estimate was 66% for the 37 patients with Stage I disease. The 3-year survival estimate for 13 patients with Stage II disease was 58%. Five of the nine patients with Stage III disease are presently alive from 3 to 23 months; one of the other four died at 35 months of disease. The stage of liver disease was the most significant variable in this survival analysis (p = 0.02); Dukes' classification of colorectal primary was significant at p less than 0.05. Those factors found not to be significant determinants of survival were: number of metastatic hepatic deposits, site of colon primary, age, sex, preoperative liver function tests, and CEA."}

In 45 patients with evaluable metastatic lesions, 35 were stable; five had progressive disease; and five had regressive disease. Plasma CEA in patients with stable disease showed an overall coefficient of variation of 13%. The CV did not differ according to various quantitative CEA levels from less than 100 ng/mL to greater than 1,000 ng/mL. The coefficient of variation in responding and progressive disease patients ranged from 13% to 63%. An analysis of CEA variability relative to the baseline CEA level was possible using the formula square root 2 times the variability about the mean; this yields a value of +/- 36% representing the range within which approximately 95% of sequential CEA levels would lie in the absence of a clinical change in disease. In 225 CEA determinations in stable disease patients, 6% demonstrated an increase beyond this level (36%) and none demonstrated a decrease of 36% or more from the baseline level. This study establishes guidelines for the boundaries of change in plasma CEA that may be applied as a criterion (in conjunction with standard objective disease parameters) for determination of tumor response to therapy."}

The patient-physician interaction is the dominant factor in such follow-up. Bone and other scans and carcinoembryonic antigen levels do not detect curable disease, so these are not indicated for routine follow-up of patients with early stage disease. For patients with metastasis, follow-up has a different emphasis and is geared to defining the extent and activity of metastasis and early detection of treatable complications so as to optimize palliation. For all patients it is necessary to continually evaluate their social and emotional requirements and to evaluate the family for risk of cancer and other problems.

Thirteen patients with advanced carcinoma of the lower colon and no evidence of extrapelvic metastasis were submitted to total pelvic exenteration with urinary diversion. The operative mortality rate was 7.7%. Determinate 5-year survival rate of 40% was achieved. Local recurrence of rectal cancer following abdominoperineal resection is rarely amenable to limited resection. Six patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions had pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. This procedure seems a reasonable treatment for palliation and the chance of cure in selected patients. CT examination of the pelvis is very valuable for the early detection and localization of recurrence."}

It has been suggested that circulating immune complexes (CIC) would provide a useful tumour marker system and that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) may form an antigen component of CIC found in patients with colorectal cancer. In this study the clinical usefulness of CIC and CIC containing CEA (CEA-IC) was investigated. Concentrations of CIC were measured in 30 patients with colorectal cancer. Fourteen patients were studied sequentially at approximately 1 month intervals after apparent curative resection of the primary tumour. Results were correlated with those obtained from serum CEA and compared to clinical status. CEA-IC were measured using a novel assay and compared with CIC and CEA values in 29 patients. CIC concentrations were elevated in patients with known disease and predicted clinical relapse in four of 14 patients. In two patients CIC remained elevated despite sustained remission. CEA-IC were not detectable in any of the patients studied. CIC estimations may augment CEA measurements as indicators of disease recurrence but lack of specificity makes them of little practical value as tumour markers in colorectal cancer. No evidence was found to support previous reports that CEA was an antigen component of CIC in this disease."}

In our follow-up study of 65 patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer, tests other than history and physical examination detected only two cases of potentially curable recurrent colorectal cancer. As a routine follow-up test, carcinoembryonic antigen determination is preferable to computerized tomographic scanning, since the sensitivity and specificity of carcinoembryonic antigen and computerized tomographic scanning were found to be equivalent and carcinoembryonic antigen is much less expensive. There was no benefit to the routine use of liver function tests or chest roentgenograms during follow-up. Since barium enema contributed little to what colonoscopy accomplished with greater comfort to the patient, barium enemas should be used only when colonoscopy is not totally successful in reaching the cecum. The most beneficial aspect of the follow-up of these patients is probably the elimination of future metachronous lesions by removal of small, benign polyps."}

The laboratory and radiologic tests that give useful information in colon and rectal cancer patients over and above that obtained by routine work-up and surgical exploration of the abdomen have not been defined previously. An analysis of surgically occult metastases was used to discover which test would assist in the management of these patients. Occult metastases for radiologic tests were those occurring within one year after resection of the primary tumor; for CEA they were metastases occurring at any time following surgery. Full lung tomography, liver/spleen scan, computerized tomogram of the abdomen, intravenous pyelogram, bone scan, and postoperative baseline CEA greater than 2.5 ng/ml were analyzed. The postoperative baseline CEA was the most sensitive test detecting occult metastases in 57 per cent (12 out of 21) of a high risk patient population. Both postoperative baseline CEA and computerized tomograms of the abdomen had high positive predictive values of 71 and 67 per cent. The negative predictive percentage of computerized tomograms of the abdomen (18 per cent) was lower than that of CEA (21 per cent). In comparing these tests in individual patients with occult recurrence, postoperative CEA and computerized tomograms of the abdomen were seen to be complementary in that approximately 90 per cent of occult metastases were detected when both examinations were used. Computerized tomogram of the abdomen and postoperative baseline CEA are useful in patients with primary colorectal cancer as part of their routine work-up."}

We have reviewed the CT scans of 30 patients who were evaluated for either primary or recurrent carcinoma of the colon and rectum in the pelvis. The results of our experience have shown that pelvic CT scans can provide accurate information regarding the extramural extension of carcinoma of the rectosigmoid undetected by other means. CT scans can detect significant ureteral pathology as accurately as can IVP and have essentially replaced the IVP in the preoperative evaluation of carcinoma of the rectum. Inflammation of the perirectal musculature, either by the effect of the local tumor or secondary to preoperative radiation, can make it difficult to determine if these structures are invaded by tumor. Tumor involvement, however, can be proved using CT localization and percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy techniques. During radiation therapy and chemotherapy, CT scans may also assist in treatment planning and may be the most reliable way of observing the objective response of the recurrent tumor in the pelvis. Finally, in the patient in whom the recurrent tumor does not produce abnormally high levels of CEA, the CT scan may be the only method by which the early and treatable recurrence may be detected. It is, therefore, appropriate to recommend that pelvic CT scan be a routine test for every patient who has had abdominoperineal resection or low anterior resection for carcinoma of the rectum and rectosigmoid."}

The authors estimated that the cost per resectable tumor was $24,779; but, under optimal circumstances, it might be as low as $10,446. The most important factors were the percentage of recurrent tumors and the proportion of these that were resectable. It proved slightly more efficient to limit the preoperative workup rather than to decrease the frequency of CEA determinations. The true benefits of CEA initiated second-look surgery in terms of prolonged survival remain unknown. More clinical experience is needed to better understand these benefits."}

Death from colorectal cancer frequently results from manifestations of recurrent local or metastatic disease following initial 'curative' therapy. Presently, the attempted curative treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer lays in the hands of the surgeon. This paper reviews the natural history of surgically treated large bowel cancer and summarizes published and National Cancer Institute experience with the surgical therapy of recurrent disease. A schema with rationale is offered for follow-up of the patient following 'curative' bowel resection. The treatment of recurrent disease incorporating the use of CEA initiated second-look laparotomy is advocated. Hepatic and pulmonary resections for metastatic disease are accepted as important therapeutic endeavours, and are discussed in some detail. It is concluded that of all patients diagnosed as having large bowel cancer, roughly 70% are resectable for cure at time of presentation, and 45% will indeed be cured by primary resection. Of the 25% who fail primary therapy, approximately 20% (5% of all colorectal cancer patients) can be cured by local re-resection or hepatic or pulmonary resection."}

Twenty six patients in the treatment group received 5FU and methyl CCNU from the time of randomisation and the remaining 26 controls were given further therapy only if there were clinical indications. All patients were followed for five years or until their death and all but one (control) developed clinical evidence of recurrence. Overall there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to disease free interval and survival. Whereas the rise in CEA in controls was generally progressive, marked inflections on the CEA curves were seen in the majority of patients receiving early treatment. Eight of 26 treated patients showed a fall in CEA of greater than 20% two months after starting therapy. These patients had a median disease free interval of 90 weeks and a median survival of 107 weeks, these figures being longer than those of treated patients who did not show a fall in CEA and control patients. The serum CEA therefore appeared to give important prognostic information in patients receiving cytotoxic treatment. Early therapy was generally well tolerated."}

Twenty-three patients were studied to assess the reliability of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in following the course of colorectal cancer. CEA estimations were made prior to surgery and again postoperatively. The resected specimens were allocated a Dukes' Stage and histological grading (well, moderate or poorly differentiated). In addition, sections were stained for the presence of CEA by an immunoperoxidase method. Of the 23 patients, twelve had either disseminated disease at initial surgery or subsequently developed metastasis/recurrence. Eleven remain disease-free at a minimum follow-up of one year. In all of these the reliability of plasma CEA values in reflecting the disease status has been assessed. No false positive elevations of CEA were found. Three factors emerge as positive predictors of CEA estimation reliability: pre-operative CEA elevation; tumour grading as well differentiated; dark staining for the presence of CEA. These factors identified 15 of the 18 patients (83%) in whom CEA appeared reliable and were not present in any of the five patients where CEA was not reliable. This reliability achieves statistical significance (X2 = 8.5, p less than 0.02). Histological demonstration of CEA may contribute to the reliability placed on plasma CEA estimations and should be considered if serial estimations are to be performed."}

Report of a case studied for carcinoembryonic antigen and review of the literature. A case of carcinoma of the small intestine arising in a patient with regional enteritis (Crohn's disease) of the ileum is reported. The patient, a 54-year-old woman, had a 21-year history of regional enteritis which was treated intermittently with sulfasalazine and prednisone. Segmental resections of the ileum had been performed on two previous occasions. Because of recurrent low-grade intestinal obstruction, another segment of ileum was resected. The bowel demonstrated the typical gross and histologic appearance of regional enteritis. Histologic examination also disclosed a carcinoma that was confined to the ileal mucosa. This case is the first reported in which a small bowel carcinoma arising in regional enteritis has been found only in the mucosa. Adjacent to the carcinoma, the mucosa showed varying degrees of dysplasia consistent with the \"precancerous\" changes that have been described in inflammatory bowel disease. Using a peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunoperoxidase technique, carcinoembryonic antigen was identified in normal, hyperplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous mucosa, but the most intense staining was seen in hyperplastic and dysplastic cells. Carcinoembryonic staining, however, did not aid in differentiating between hyperplasia, dysplasia, and carcinoma because of an overlap in staining frequency and intensity."}

A strong correlation was evident between preoperative CEA level and Dukes class. The mean CEA progressively increased with each Dukes category and the mean value for each of the four classes was significantly different. This relationship was prevalent whether the data were analyzed for all colorectal lesions regardless of location or specifically for right-sided colon tumors. The prognostic function of preoperative CEA level was independent of the number of positive histologic nodes. Preoperative CEA level correlated with the degree of lumen encirclement by tumor. Tumors that did not encircle more than one half the lumen were associated with significantly lower preoperative CEA levels than those that did. The presence or absence of lumen obstruction was unrelated to the preoperative CEA level. The relative risk of developing a treatment failure was associated with preoperative CEA, in both Dukes B and C patients, demonstrating that the prognostic significance of preoperative CEA was independent of Dukes class."}

A change in the proximate cause of death and a need for effective systemic adjuvant therapy. During a period of 7 years, we have aggressively treated liver tumors whether primary or metastatic. Our experience after 43 curative major liver resections has shown an excellent overall survival: 34 of 43 patients still alive a median of 12 months after liver resection (patient ages ranged from 21 to 85 years, median 57 years). Nineteen patients underwent right hepatic lobectomy, 9 trisegmentectomy, 5 left hepatic lobectomy, 5 extended left hepatic lobectomy, 4 right lobectomy plus left lobe wedge resection, and 1 patient underwent a major hilar wedge resection. Two patients died from sepsis and hepatic failure on or before the 60th postoperative day. One patient with no evidence of recurrent colorectal cancer was lost to follow-up after 2.5 years. One patient died without cancer 12 months after left hepatic lobectomy for colon cancer metastases. Cumulative survival for the entire series and for patients after resection of colorectal cancer metastases was the same: 1 year survival 90 percent; 2 year survival 75 percent, and 3 year survival 65 percent. Seventeen of 30 patients remain disease-free after resection of liver metastases. Of the 13 who had recurrence, 8 are still alive. Ten recurrences were outside of the residual liver (predominantly multiple pulmonary metastases). One recurrence was in the right hemidiaphragm, and only three were in the residual or regenerated liver. Serial carcinoembryonic antigen analysis was the best indicator of recurrence in these 13 patients, 12 of whom were asymptomatic. These data confirm that major liver resection can be performed with minimum postoperative mortality (4.7 percent in this series). More importantly, the majority of patients were cured of their liver metastases. The next goal should be the initiation of adjuvant systemic therapy trials after liver resection in such patients."}

However, in 40 out of 61 cases (66%) with recurrencies or metastases continuous increases of CA 19-9 were observed which preceded the clinical relapse by up to 16 months (median 2 months). Concomitant determination of CEA increased sensitivity to 90% due to partial complementary information. This was particularly pronounced in gastric carcinomas in whom continuous increases of CEA involved only 58% of all patients with tumour progression. By simultaneous determination of both tumour markers this ratio rose by increases of both or one antigen to 83%."}

High preoperative levels which normalize after operation, are equal to curative resection. The importance of CEA is emphasized in the postoperative follow-up of especially Dukes B and C lesions, where starting from normal base figures, increasing CEA levels are suggesting recurrences, long before their clinical evidence.

Computed tomographic (CT) study of the pelvis revealed recurrent tumor images in relation to the adjacent pelvic structures. Five patients with deeply invading recurrent lesions were submitted to pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection. No postoperative deaths were encountered. The postoperative sharp drops of serum CEA levels are useful for judging the adequacy of this procedure. The follow-up status of the 5 patients, respectively: 14 months alive with pulmonary metastasis, 9 months alive without symptoms but with slightly elevated CEA levels, and 8 months, 3 months, and 3 weeks alive with no evidence of disease. All patients who were relieved of perineal or sciatic nerve pain are now able to walk without any assistance or trouble. Total en bloc residual pelvic exenteration combined with sacral resection is a reasonable treatment for locally recurrent rectal cancer."}

Forty-two patients with localized colorectal cancer (Dukes' A, B, C stages) were treated with potentially curative surgery and controlled with a follow-up program, which included CEA monitoring, for a period ranging from 12 to 48 months (median 33 months). During this period, we observed recurrent neoplastic disease in 14 patients. A retrospective analysis of the results showed that: 1. patients with a preoperative CEA value greater than 20 ng/ml have a significantly higher risk of recurrence than the patients with CEA less than 20 ng/ml; 2. sensitivity of the CEA test was good for metastatic recurrent disease, fairly good for residual neoplastic disease, but insufficient for local recurrence; 3. test-specificity was poor, as demonstrated by the negative results of four exploratory laparotomies performed exclusively on the basis of increased CEA levels. Since the principal aim of a second-look operation is the cure of local recurrence, this type of surgery cannot be proposed only on the basis of increased CEA levels."}

Ten asymptomatic patients who had undergone resection of rectal carcinoma were evaluated prospectively by at least three serial computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the pelvis within 24 months of surgery. Of the seven patients who had undergone abdominoperineal resection, five were found to have a presacral mass due to normal postoperative changes within the first 4 months. The mass showed a variable diminution between 4 and 9 months after operation and developed a more distinct outline, partial separation from the sacrum, or a change in configuration to a thin transverse sliver. These changes indicate the possibility of CT differentiation of a normal postoperative mass from local recurrence. In the other five patients, no postoperative mass was observed. In one patient CT demonstrated a solitary 1.5 cm lymph node metastasis. This patient was asymptomatic and had a normal carcinoembryonic antigen level. From these observations, a baseline CT study of the pelvis within 2-4 months of resection of rectal carcinoma, followed by serial CT examinations at about 6-month intervals is recommended for the detection of early asymptomatic pelvic recurrence and to facilitate differentiation from persistent postoperative changes."}

Patients with recurrences and metastases showed either positive profiles or conversion of positivity; only 3 patients were negative in both tests. However, despite significant disease-related response of the LMT, the test is not recommended as an adjunct to postsurgical monitoring, because of its technical complexity."}

Megavoltage radiotherapy was used in all patients and doses ranges from 35 to 40 Gy during 2.5 to 3 weeks. Among the 344 patients treated between 1969 and 1981, the ratio of abdominoperineal excision to anterior resection was 239/105, the percentage of pelvic recurrence was 7,8 per cent, and the 5-year survival rate, including postoperative mortality (5.2%) was 78 per cent in the Centre Claudius Regaud series and 64 per cent in the Centre Paul Lamarque series. The 10-year survival rate was 50 per cent. There was no evidence of an increased morbidity following irradiation. Pathologic staging showed no residual tumour in the excised specimen in 5.2 per cent of the cases. The number of Dukes'C cases was smaller than according to the clinical pre-treatment assessment of the tumours (16%). Ultrasonography of the liver and plasmatic CEA determination avoid irradiation of metastatic patients. Further development of this curative approach should include a postoperative boost of 25 Gy for patients who are at high risk for local failure in the pelvis, and an adjuvant chemotherapy for Dukes'C patients."}

Serum concentrations of the antigen were estimated at three month intervals for a minimum of two years. Computed tomography at the time of operation detected occult hepatic metastases in 12 patients. Of the remaining 39 patients, six developed local recurrence alone, two developed disseminated disease in the absence of hepatic metastases, and one developed hepatic disease at 10 months, as detected by sequential computed tomography. Of all 13 patients with asymptomatic hepatic metastases, only eight developed an increase in serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentrations before death. The median interval between detection by computed tomography and rise in antigen concentrations was 7.5 months.

In several cases there was a discrepancy between serological and morphological results. Based on recent investigations elevated CEA levels might be only useful in reflecting a relapse of carcinoma of the colon. Immunohistological determinations were done by IFT and PAP-method. The results of both assay systems were comparable. CEA could be also detected in benign neoplasiogenic tissue, i.e. in tubular type of adenomatose polyps and in ulcerative colitis. Both diseases are known to become malignant at an high degree. By contrast no CEA could be detected in hyperplasiogenic polyps. Detection of CEA in malignant tissue might be useful for final classification of tumors. Occurrence of CEA in non malignant tissue should give rise to control in short regular intervals.

These patients were followed for at least 2 years and divided in 2 groups: a) group NR: 48 patients apparently free of loco-regional recurrence and of distant metastases, b) group R: 43 patients presenting a cancerous relapse. High levels of beta 2-microglobulin were found in 21 patients of group NR (specificity: 56 p. 100) and in 25 patients of group R (sensitivity: 58 p. 100). In the same population, the specificity and the sensitivity of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for the diagnosis of a relapse were 92 p. 100 and 88 p. 100 respectively. No significant statistical correlation was observed between the levels of beta 2-microglobulin and CEA. The sensitivity of the association beta 2-microglobulin + CEA was not superior to the dosage of CEA alone despite its reduced specificity (54 p. 100). These results indicate that the diagnostic value of the dosage of beta 2-microglobulin is inferior to that of CEA and is without interest for the detection of tumoral recurrence in the postoperative follow-up of colorectal cancers."}

We examined a commercial RIA kit using heat inactivation, and compared results with those obtained with PCA precipitation. Adequate sensitivity (1.5 micrograms CEA/l plasma), satisfactory analytical recovery of CEA added to plasma, and dilutional linearity of samples found to have elevated CEA concentrations, were demonstrated for the heat-inactivation assay. Between-assay precision was better with the heat inactivation than with the PCA assay. Although the absolute concentration of CEA estimated after heat inactivation was consistently lower than that estimated after PCA extraction of plasma specimens, there was excellent correlation between results obtained with the two methods in colon cancer patients free of disease, colon cancer patients with residual or recurrent disease, patients with benign gastrointestinal disease, and in patients with chronic renal failure.

The scintigrams were then processed by computer to subtract the images of the 99mTc-serum albumin and pertechnetate administered, which reflect background and nontarget radioactivity, from the 131I-antibody scans. The results indicate that radioimmunodetection is a safe and a potentially clinically useful cancer detection method, which in this study demonstrated primary colorectal carcinomas in 10 of 12 (83%) of the patients evaluated preoperatively and between 87% (46 of 53) and 92% (49 of 53) of known metastatic tumor sites. Thus, the method's overall sensitivity (true-positive rate) was 86%-91% on a tumor-site basis. A false-negative rate of between 9% and 14% and a false-positive rate of less than 4% were found. In 11 of the 51 patients evaluated, tumor sites were detected that were not found by other clinical methods of cancer detection. These sites of tumor were then confirmed later, as much as 40 wk after radioimmunodetection was performed. It is concluded that in colorectal cancer patients, the current method of carcinoembryonic antigen radioimmunodetection can (a) contribute to the preoperative clinical staging of the patients, (b) assist in the postoperative evaluation of tumor recurrence or spread, (c) complement other methods used to assess tumor response to therapy, (d) support the indication of a rising carcinoembryonic antigen titer (when other methods cannot detect tumor) for second-look surgery, and (e) confirm the findings of other detection measures that are less tumor-specific."}

Patients were treated radically or palliatively on the basis of clinical presentation and routine laboratory tests, but without regard to the plasma CEA level prior to treatment. The pretreatment CEA level was assessed retrospectively as an indicator of the response to treatment. Patients with a plasma CEA level in excess of 75 ng/ml had a poor prognosis, even after radical radiotherapy, whereas patients with plasma CEA less than 75 ng/ml responded better to treatment. These results suggest that plasma CEA is of value, indicating the need for radical or palliative radiotherapy. In patients with high plasma CEA at referral, radical radiotherapy appears to confer little benefit. Those with a low plasma CEA appear to respond better to radical radiotherapy, and this should be the preferred treatment in this group unless the clinical presentation indicates otherwise."}

The results indicate that acute-phase reactant proteins have a higher diagnostic rate for the presence of malignancy than does CEA. Estimation of the serum protein hexose alone is of greater diagnostic value than a combination of acute-phase reactant proteins. Furthermore, serum protein hexose and CEA are complementary and when combined will reflect the presence of malignancy in a greater number of patients than either one alone. Following resection of primary large bowel cancer, acute-phase reactant proteins are as accurate as CEA in evaluating the disease-free status of patients and furthermore when combined with CEA increased the predictive value for the detection of patients with recurrent disease."}

The individual doubling times of the serum CEA concentration in the log CEA period were calculated and found to cover distinct ranges dependent on the diagnosis of disease recurrence. The CEA doubling times concomitant with local recurrence or second primary carcinomas ranged from 142 to 868 days, visceral metastasis other than liver metastasis from 47 to 231 days and liver metastasis from 10 to 102 days. Patients with bone metastases exhibited CEA doubling times of 54-60 days and a patient with brain metastasis had a CEA doubling time of 598 days. The CEA doubling times of patients with liver metastasis and no further treatment, correlated well with the time of survival after the initial CEA increase of the log CEA phase (r = 0.870, n = 33).

Among the tumor-associated antigens evaluated for the diagnosis and management of cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the only established and clinically useful tumor marker for colorectal cancer and other CEA-producing tumors. Because of the exhaustive studies in the past decade, a consensus development conference was held at NIH in September 1980, to address the issue concerning the role of CEA as a marker in the management of cancer. This conference concluded that the use of regular and sequential assays of blood CEA is the best noninvasive technique for postoperative surveillance of patients to detect disseminated recurrence of colorectal cancer. The CEA level can serve as an indicator of successful or incomplete resection, and is useful in monitoring the effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. CEA can also provide a useful estimate of prognosis. CEA is neither sensitive nor specific enough to be used in routine screening for possible malignancy in an asymptomatic population. Nor can this test independently establish a diagnosis of cancer, but it can be used as an adjunct to clinical staging methods in known cancer patients. Radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy with anti-CEA antibodies are currently being evaluated. Study of the pathophysiology and metabolism of CEA is needed. CEA remains the prototype tumor marker and is a valuable comparative tool, when investigating the clinical value of other newly developed tests for tumor markers."}

Sixty-five per cent of patients with recurrence showed a raised plasma CEA level, and over half the patients who developed recurrence had a raised level some time before the disease was detected by other means. A surprising number of patients had a raised CEA level on a single occasion which subsequently returned to normal at the next follow-up and did not seem to be associated with malignancy.

The second system consisted of the human lung carcinoma line (LX1) and four subpopulations (LX1-1, LX1-2, LX1-3, and LX1-9). These subpopulations have previously been shown to be markedly heterogeneous in terms of such characteristics as karyotype, morphology, drug sensitivity, tumorigenicity, and expression of membrane glycoproteins (such as carcinoembryonic antigen and tumor colonic mucoprotein antigen). Exponentially growing cultures were irradiated with graded single doses of 100-kVp X-rays.

Values for the mean lethal dose (D0, grays), quasithreshold dose (Dq, grays), and extrapolation number (n) were obtained. For the human colon adenocarcinoma system, these values for the three tumor lines were: DLD-1, 0.95, 2.34, and 11.7; clone A, 1.06, 2.23 and 8.20; and clone D, 1.08, 1.89, and 5.80.

The levels of these antigens were compared to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Sixty-six patients had at least one antigen elevated in the preoperative period. Malignancy recurred in 10 patients. In 8 of these the recurrence could have been predicted by the persistence or rise in antigen levels 3 to 18 months prior to the detection of the recurrence by current clinical methods. The data suggest that the assays for these antigens are valuable prognostic aids for making clinical therapeutic decisions and appropriately stratifying patients for clinical trials."}

Recent data would limit indications for serum CEA measurement primarily to follow-up of resected colonic malignancy, yet physician attitude and usage patterns may lag far behind current findings. This discrepancy was investigated at our institution, where more than 1100 CEAs costing $71,000 are ordered each year. Of 45 physicians (all MDs ordering a CEA test during a preselected month), over 50% believed the test to be worthwhile in initial detection of colonic cancer, and 69% thought an elevated CEA to be an adequate reason to begin an aggressive workup to rule out cancer of the colon in a nonsmoking, previously healthy patient. Impressions of cost were less than or equal to $30 (50% of true cost) in nearly half of MDs and less than 20% of true cost in a tenth of MDs. Analysis of the medical record revealed that indications of questionable validity (initial detection of cancer together with follow-up of noncolonic malignancy) accounted for the majority of requested CEAs and included the attempted detection or monitoring of 12 different tumor types in addition to its use as a \"general cancer screen.\" Patient benefit was realized in none in a random sample of 106 cases (beta = 0.11, power = 0.89 for an assumed benefit of 2%), while management was altered in only one patient as a direct result of the CEA value. It is important that we continue to inform and educate our colleagues about relatively expensive tests that have only limited and specific application."}

Of 340 patients with histologically proven colorectal carcinoma, hepatic metastases were diagnosed in 90 (26 per cent), in 50 at the time of initial surgery (synchronously) and in 40 during the post-operative follow-up (metachronously). At the time of initial surgery, plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were markedly elevated in patients with synchronous metastases and normal or only moderately elevated in those with metachronous metastases. During follow-up, CEA levels in the entire group of patients with metastases remained normal in 8 per cent and rose in the remainder: very quickly in 85 per cent and slowly in 15 per cent. Hepatic metastases were diagnosed by strict scintigraphic criteria in 70 per cent of patients and were suggested by liberal criteria in the remainder. During follow-up, hepatic metastases progressed in the scintigraphic image from those defined by liberal to those diagnosed by strict criteria. In two-thirds of the patients, liver scintigraphy proved to be superior to the CEA test in diagnosing hepatic metastases by strict criteria; in the majority of the remainder of patients, the CEA test, particularly in cases with a pattern of fast increase of CEA in plasma, suggested metastases before a definite diagnosis could be made by liver scintigraphy. In only 3 per cent of the patients neither liver scintigraphy nor the CEA test were indicative of metastases. Thus, the two diagnostic modalities, when combined, could attain a sensitivity of 97 per cent, when patients with persistently rising CEA levels and concomitant liver lesions defined by the liberal criteria were grouped with those for whom scintigraphy was unequivocal."}

We followed up 790 patients with cancer of the colon and rectum treated at our hospital since 1962. The curative resection rate in the rectum and anus was 78 percent but decreased as the distance of the lesion from the anus increased. In the ascending colon the rate was 59.8 percent. The patients undergoing curative resection had a 5 year survival rate of 65 percent and a 10 year survival rate of 45 percent. The closer to the anus, the poorer the prognosis. Prognosis is greatly influenced by the stage at diagnosis. Surgical results have improved annually due to progress in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Factors greatly influencing prognosis were the presence of lymph node metastasis, the degree of invasion of the intestinal wall and the site of the primary lesion. Lymph node metastasis was an especially important prognostic factor. In cancer of the rectum primary recurrences were most often found in local sites (66 percent of cases), followed by metastasis to the liver and the lung. However, in cancer of the colon metastasis in both the liver and the peritoneum was observed in 67 percent of the cases. On the basis of these results, methods to prevent local recurrence of cancer of the rectum as well as metastasis to the liver from cancer of the colon must be developed. When extended abdominopelvic wide dissection was performed, the incidence of local recurrence decreased."}

Among the 563 patients on the colon cancer study (GI 6175) and the 207 patients on the rectal cancer study (GI 7175), one third had preoperative CEA determinations and more than 90% had some postoperative CEA monitoring. Colon cancer patients whose preoperative CEA was greater than 5 ng/ml had a greater probability of recurring than those whose values were lower (33% versus 18% recurrence with 21 months minimum follow-up; p < 0.05). The prognostic value of preoperative CEA was apparent only in patients with Dukes' C1 colon tumors. Preoperative CEA values were not of prognostic significance among the rectal adenocarcinoma patients. Although elevated levels of CEA after resection of either colon or rectum cancers were strongly associated with subsequent tumor recurrence, no single CEA value, arbitrarily defined as \"elevated\", provided an adequate screening test with both high sensitivity and high specificity. Postoperative CEA elevations were more strongly predictive of recurrence when part of a steadily rising trend. In the colon cancer study, the median monthly increase in CEA for disease-free patients was estimated to be zero, and for the relapsed patients 5.8%. The corresponding estimates for patients on the rectal cancer protocol were zero and 7.8%. Only 36 of the 344 disease-free patients on the colon protocol and 14 of the 94 disease-free patients on the rectal protocol (15%) exhibited a rate of increase of CEA as high as 3% per month over the entire period of observation. Two thirds of the relapsed patients on both studies showed a rate of increase this high or higher. The patterns of CEA rise in individual patients were quite varied, however, and monthly rates of increase as established in our study are not to be used as guidelines in patient management."}

Three hundred and eighty serum samples from 167 patients with malignant or non-malignant diseases and from 134 normal individuals with or without heavy smoking habits were analyzed by the 2 assays. Excellent correlation between the results of the 2 assays was obtained, but the M-EIA, using monoclonal antibodies from a single hybridoma, did not discriminate better than the conventional RIA between CEA produced by different types of carcinoma and between CEA associated with malignant or non-malignant diseases. Follow-up studies of several patients by sequential CEA determinations with the 2 assays showed that the M-EIA was as accurate as the RIA for the detection of tumor recurrences."}

Two Mabs were physically adsorbed to polystyrene balls and the third Mab was coupled to alkaline phosphatase using the bifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate. During a first incubation, CEA from heat-extracted serum samples was immunoadsorbed to the antibody coated balls. After washing of the balls, bound CEA was detected by a second incubation with the enzyme coupled Mab. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.6 ng per ml of serum. A total of 196 serum samples from patients with various types of carcinoma, with liver cirrhosis, or from healthy blood donors with or without smoking habits, were tested. The results obtained with the monoclonal enzyme immunoassay (M-EIA) were compared with those obtained with perchloric acid extracts of the same serum samples tested by an inhibition radioimmunoassay using conventional goat anti-CEA antiserum. There was an excellent correlation between the two assays. In particular, the new M-EIA gave good results for the detection of tumor recurrences in the follow-up of colon carcinoma patients. However, despite the use of exclusively monoclonal antibodies the new assay detected a similar percentage of slightly elevated CEA values as the conventional assay in patients with non-malignant disease, suggesting that the CEA associated with non-malignant diseases is immunologically identical to the CEA released by colon carcinoma."}

Initial clinical evaluation as a marker for colorectal cancer. A radiometric immunoassay for detecting colon-specific antigen-p (CSAp) in the blood of patients suspected of having colorectal cancer has been developed and evaluated in 272 subjects of various disease entities. Using 10 units/ml as the cutoff value for normalcy, the results indicate that the highest number of elevated CSAp titers occurred in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (61%). Only one of 12 colonic adenoma patients had an elevated CSAp titer, and this was slightly above the 10 units/ml cutoff. Other nonneoplastic gastrointestinal disorders showed an 18% abnormal CSAp titer frequency, of which more than half bordered the upper limit of normalcy. CSAp elevations were also found in gastric cancer (20%), pancreatic cancer (20%), breast cancer (5%), and normal individuals (3%). CSAp was compared to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in 44 colorectal cancer patients, in 12 patients with colonic adenomas, and in 62 patients with diverse gastrointestinal disorders. Using a CEA cutoff of 5 ng/ml, CSAp could increase the diagnostic accuracy of the CEA plasma test in colorectal cancer patients by 14%. In patients with colonic adenomas, the CSAp titer was normal when the CEA value was elevated in 25% of the cases. However, both were simultaneously elevated in only 3% of the patients with benign gastrointestinal disorders. Since the CSAp test was less frequently elevated (0-7%) in patients with breast, ovarian, lung, or cervical cancer than was found for CEA (39-75% elevated), it seems that the CSAp blood assay detects colorectal cancer more specifically than the more generally distributed CEA. These results suggest that the combined use of blood CEA and CSAp could enhance the discrimination of colorectal cancers from other nonmalignant gastrointestinal diseases, and could also serve to enhance the colorectal cancer-specificity of the CEA assay. Furthermore, serial monitoring of both markers in four advanced colorectal cancer patients indicated that they reflect disease activity, falling after successful treatment and rising again with recurrence and disease progression."}

Liver metastases due to the more common neoplastic diseases such as colorectal, breast, or bronchogenic carcinoma are a frequent occurrence and are associated with an ominous prognosis. Earlier detection followed by appropriate therapeutic interventions might have a decided effect on the subsequent course of disease. Controversy exists over the selection of tests with the greatest sensitivity, specificity, and potential utility. Preliminary evidence suggest that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and 5'-nucleotidase may be of particular significance. Four enzymes--gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, 5'-nucleotidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase plus carcinoembryonic antigen--were compared in the same blood samples from selected patients with breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung. Gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase was the most sensitive test with 28/29 (97%) patients with hepatic metastases having elevated enzymatic activity in their sera. For patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung followed serially, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity was increased an average of 5 months before liver metastases were detected by clinical means. Two factors are important in the interpretation of the results of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase analysis: (1) Hepatic dysfunction due to diseases other than metastatic tumor involvement can cause a rise in enzyme levels as can (2) medications or ethanol which activate the hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing system. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that antitumor chemotherapy, even intensive and multiple agent, did not appear to effect the enzyme activity in the sera of patients with breast or small cell carcinoma of the lung. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in combination with carcinoembryonic antigen may be of particular value in detecting liver metastases and in assessing subsequent response to therapy."}

Monitoring of CEA in patients' serum was of no value for the early detection of tumour recurrence in either breast or head and neck cancer patients. It was of value for the early detection of lung cancer recurrence, but these patients were always beyond the scope of cure. In colorectal cancer patients, two-thirds of recurrences were heralded by a rising CEA, but only one of 15 patients had disease confined to local tissues which could be totally excised, although a further three patients had liver metastases which were apparently localized to one lobe of the liver. For colorectal cancer patients, serial CEA estimations are an effective method for the early diagnosis of recurrence, although this seldom translates into improved patient benefit."}

The profile of serum glycoproteins is altered in malignancy with a relative increase in acute phase reactant proteins. A prospective study has been performed to investigate three sugar moieties (hexose, hexosamine and sialic acid) of these glycoproteins in the serum of large-bowel cancer patients as a possible guide to recurrence, and to compare these three variables with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The three variables indicated the presence of colorectal cancer in over 65 per cent of 107 cancer-bearing subjects. Furthermore, the appearance of metastatic disease was associated with abnormalities in these variables in 10 of 11 patients, and appears more accurately reflected than with CEA. However, the three variables and CEA are cumulative in their value for predicting recurrent cancer. Monitoring of acute phase reactant proteins may therefore be of potential clinical benefit for monitoring of colorectal cancer patients at high risk of recurrence."}

Second-look laparotomy was performed in 32 patients who had significant CEA elevations following curative resection for adenocarcinoma of the large bowel. All were asymptomatic, with no demonstrable evidence of recurrence on work-up prior to surgery. Five patients developed subsequent CEA elevations after curative resections at second-look surgery and, while remaining asymptomatic, underwent re-exploration. A total of 37 laparotomies were performed. The CEA level at second-look ranged from 5.1--470 ng/ml with a median level of 25 ng/ml, the time delay ranged from 1--20 months with a median of four months, and the rate of CEA elevation ranged from 0.39--49.05 ng/ml in two weeks with a median of 3.17 ng/ml in two weeks. Recurrent disease was documented in 33 (89%) and four patients had negative explorations (11%). Liver metastasis was evident in 18 with seven curative resections, and local-abdominal disease in 15 with nine curative resections, giving a resectability rate of 43% (16/37). Lower CEA levels, shorter time delays to surgery, and slower rates of CEA elevation were directly related to the resectability rate. The follow-up ranged from 2--61 months, with a median of 15 months. Eight patients are alive and well, 8--61 months, 10 patients are alive with disease 10--47 months; and 14 patients are dead of disease 2--37 months following the second-look surgery. These results suggest a definite role for CEA in selecting patients for second-look laparotomy; however, more follow-up is necessary to document prolonged survival."}

Thirty-three recurrences and 29 deaths were reported among this population after a median follow-up interval of 55 months. Preoperative CEA levels correlated with the Dukes' classification. However, the preoperative level adds significant information to Dukes' classification in the prediction of recurrence. Postoperative CEA assays taken later in the clinical evaluation process carry the most prognostic information for subsequent recurrence. Using matched-pairs techniques, the authors noted that CEA often rose in anticipation of recurrence, sometimes as early as one year before recurrence. The following four follow-up CEA events were evaluated: 1) three consecutive rising CEA's 2) CEA rises 5.0 ng/ml; 3) CEA exceeds 5.0 ng/ml; 4) CEA exceeds 5.0 ng/ml two consecutive times. The follow-up CEA events examined were characterized by false positive rates ranging from 17% to 66% and true positive rates ranging from 43% to 56% in the prediction of recurrence. From follow-up CEA evaluations, further clinical investigation appeared most warranted when CEA exceeds 5.0 ng/ml at two consecutive follow-up evaluations, but the chances of finding any subsequent recurrent disease was near 50%. Among patients experiencing recurrences, although forewarned by CEA elevations, there was no subsequent time when patients were most likely to have recurrence of disease."}

The effect of chemotherapy on hepatic function and therefore on CEA level is not clear. We discuss a patient who, after a potentially curative resection for adenocarcinoma, demonstrated a rise in CEA level in the absence of recurrent carcinoma. This rise correlated with administration of intravenous 5-fluorouracil. Liver biopsy demonstrated severe fatty infiltration with no evidence of cirrhosis. The possible liver toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs must be considered as a factor responsible for the rise in CEA. Simultaneous assessment of hepatic function is essential to the accurate interpretation of CEA levels, especially in patients receiving chemotherapy."}

Daily analysis was made during the irradiation, and, moreover, a determination 2 weeks after the resection of the tumor. Simultaneously CEA and LDH were determined in 10 controls. Serum CEA and LDH levels were found significantly increased in tumor patients as compared to controls. The course was characterized by a peak of LDH on days 4 and 7 from the onset of radiation treatment, while serum CEA did not show a peak in the total of the tumor patients; but in 3 individual patients a peak was detected. In 5 patients, with low CEA values from the beginning, no significant modifications of CEA did appear. Thus, some of the patients undergoing irradiation revealed CEA kinetics conform to theoretical considerations, suggesting a response to irradiation of the colorectal carcinoma. The prognostic value of the early CEA kinetics during radiation treatment should be examined in patients being irradiated for inoperable local recurrence."}

With few exceptions, individual tumor cells contained either CEA, BGS, or neither, but not both. Cancers of the left colon which were positive for BGS were associated with a lower frequency of metastases than were those without BGS (p less than 0.01); tumors lacking both CEA and BGS metastasized more frequently than those tumors containing either or both antigens (p less than 0.01). In tumors of the right colon, there was no significant correlation between antigen content and frequency of metastases. In three cases, the development of recurrent or metastatic tumor was associated with a loss of BGS positivity.

The data indicate the CEA levels are consistently lower in ovarian cancer than in colorectal cancer and that the assay is not of value in the primary diagnosis of ovarian cancer. It may, however, be of prognostic significance in that advanced disease and undifferentiated tumors which carry the worst prognoses demonstrate elevated CEA levels with higher frequency. CEA levels may also be of value in assessing the response to therapy and in detecting recurrent disease. Patients who demonstrated good clinical responses to therapy showed a drop to low plasma CEA levels while patients with poor responses showed no decrease or a rise in CEA levels. Moreover, CEA rose again after a postoperative drop in patients with recurrent disease before they demonstrated clinical evidence of recurrence. The relationship of plasma levels to tissue levels of CEA and to histologic type of ovarian carcinoma remains unclear."}

The amount of CEA in tumor tissue of 17 patients with poorly differentiated colorectal cancer was estimated with the immunoperoxidase staining technique and was correlated with histology and plasma CEA levels obtained during various stages of disease. Five tumors did not stain negatively for CEA and all had predominantly poorly differentiated histologies. In all of these patients metastatic disease developed but not elevated plasma CEA levels. In contrast 12 tumors stained positively for CEA and were found to contain either differentiated areas or signet ring cells. Serial plasma CEA levels correctly monitored the postoperative course of all 12 patients. Six of these had a relapse and all were detected by serial increases in plasma CEA. The remaining six were disease free greater than 48 months after resection and had normal plasma CEA levels. Among poorly differentiated tumors, those that contain glandforming areas or signet ring cells can be assumed to produce CEA and plasma CEA levels can be used effectively for monitoring.

Among patients with either breast or colorectal cancer who were clinically disease free following their initial therapy, the median FHAP concentration (1.54 IU/liter) was intermediate between the median FHAP concentration in patients with untreated or recurrent cancer and that of healthy control subjects. In order to illustrate the potential clinical application of FHAP as a diagnostic cancer marker, we have selected a serum FHAP concentration of 2.22 IU/liter as a reference value above which only 3% of healthy control subjects would have a \"positive\" test.

The median follow-up periods of these patients was 50 months (range 36-72 months). Twenty-one patients were found to have metastases at the time of their operation. None of the seven patients whose primary tumors were classified as Dukes/Kirklin A have had tumor recurrence. Seventeen per cent of the patients with Dukes/Kirklin B tumors have had tumor recurrences, and 63% of the patients with Dukes/Kirklin C colorectal primary tumors have had tumor recurrence. No correlation was found between preoperative CEA values and subsequent risk of tumor recurrence or times to recurrence among the patients with Dukes/Kirklin B colorectal primary cancers. In Dukes/Kirklin C patients, however, elevated preoperative CEA values predicted a higher risk of tumor recurrence. Ninety per cent of the patients (19/21) with preoperative CEA levels greater than 5.0 ng/ml have had relapses, with a median time of 17 months before disease recurrence. Only 39% (9/23) of the patients with Dukes/Kirklin C lesions and CEA levels less than 5 ng/ml have had relapses and there is insufficient follow-up data as yet to determine the median survival time. If those patients whose Dukes/Kirklin C primary tumors were poorly differentiated on histologic examination are excluded, the contrast between patients having CEA levels greater than 5.0 ng/ml and those having CEA levels less than 5 ng/ml is even more marked. Sixteen of the 18 remaining patients whose CEA levels were greater than 5.0 ng/ml prior to curative resection have had relapses as compared with only three of 15 patients whose preoperative CEA values were less than 5. We conclude, therefore, that CEA is an important factor in stratifying patients after curative resection of their Dukes/Kirklin C colorectal tumors."}

We believe patients who have elevated CEA levels before resectioning procedures and who also have documented cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, with a subsequent drop in normal CEA levels postoperatively, should have sequential monthly determinations of colonic embryonal antigens. If there is an increase in levels of concentration, there is at that time justification for surgical intervention. The earlier the detection of elevated colonic embryonic antigen is accomplished, the better are the odds for a successful surgical resection of recurrent disease. The values of the CEA studies define slopes which can identify local recurrence and liver metastasis. For these slope values, it is necessary that the CEA level be drawn regularly. We consider this a promising real clinical advance in that it permits for better utilization of the two significant therapeutic modalities we have for the treatment of cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, namely resectional surgery and radiation therapy. CEA determinations have false positives and limited specificity. It is unfortunate that adult tissues express fetal antigens under conditions wherein there are bursts of cellular activity. This should not diminish the significance of tumor-embryo cross reactivity. This reactivity phenomenon is, in the words of Sir Peter Medawar, \"a now well attested empirical fact,\" and this observation is \"profoundly interesting and potentially important.\" The eventual significance of this fact may well transcend current use of the CEA in the diagnosis of recurrent cancer of the gastrointestinal tract."}

The clinical significance of the direct CPB assay for CEA was assessed by correlating serial CEA values with the clinical status of patients with breast and colorectal cancer. Increasing CEA values correlated with progressive or recurrent neoplastic disease, and decreasing CEA values correlated with response of the patient to therapy. No false positive direct CPB values for CEA were observed in the clinical study or in the method comparison study. Our laboratory and clinical evaluation demonstrate that the direct CPB method is an accurate and reliable method for the quantitation of CEA. In addition, the method permits high volume analysis and eliminates the hazards to safety that are associated with perchloric acid."}

The response rate of metastatic colorectal carcinoma confined to the liver to HAI of FUDR alone is at the range of 50% and to mitomycin C by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) at the range of 35%. Mitomycin C was added to FUDR by continuous infusion and given by HAI to 12 patients with colorectal cancer confined to the liver. Catheters were placed subselectively in the hepatic artery, and infusion continued for five to six days when the catheter was removed. Cycles were repeated every 30 days. Chemotherapy consisted of mitomycin C 15 mg/m2 administered on day 1 followed by FUDR 100 mg/m2 by continuous infusion daily for five days. Response to treatment was evaluated by serial determinations of plasma CEA and by imaging techniques consisting of a computerized tomography, sonography, and radionuclide scanning of liver as well as by angiography. In 2 patients, complete remission was achieved; in 4 patients a 75% and in another 4 patients a 50% decrease in liver metastasis was observed, while 2 patients had stable disease. Thus, a response rate of 83% with a median duration of six to seven months was achieved. The median survival of the these patients was 16 months. Eight of the 12 patients have failed previous, i.v. 5-FU containing regimens. Complications related to 45 treatment cycles were the following: catheter displacement in 11.1%, an intimal tear, usually in the hepatic artery in 4.4%, gastric ulcerations in 5.4%, and septicemia in 2.7% of the cycles. In addition, aneurysmal dilation of the hepatic artery occurred in 4 patients (8.8% of the treatment cycles), all of whom continued treatment. Chemotherapy-related complications included primarily thrombocytopenia and stomatitis. Mitomycin C + FUDR by hepatic arterial infusion is an effective treatment for colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the liver. The high response rate justifies the adjuvant treatment of Dukes class C colon cancer patients with this treatment."}

At the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, a concurrently controlled, randomized, prospective surgical adjuvant trial involving Dukes' B2 and C colorectal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma (T1-4, No-2, Mo) has been activated for the last two years. To date, a total of 150 patients have been entered into the three arms of the trial (namely control, immunotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy). Of these, 127 cases are colorectal carcinoma and 28 are gastric cancer. As part of the protocol, serial CEA determinations are obtained in all patients on a regular three-monthly basis. So far, 28 patients have confirmed recurrence (colorectal 20, gastric 8) demonstrated clinically or radiologically. Out of these 28 patients, 25 (89.2%) had CEA greater than 2.5 ng/ml months before actual demonstration of recurrence. However, if one uses a cutoff of 5.0 ng/ml as significant, that is, one standard deviation from the usual accepted value, then 21 out of 28 (75%) had persistent, elevated CEA's months before the recurrence manifested itself clinically or radiologically. The CEA profiles of three representative cases from each arm of the adjuvant trial are included. It is suggested that serial CEA determinations will be an invaluable adjunctive test in following patients in an adjuvant trial setting."}

Of the 38 patients with normal (less than 5 ng/ml) plasma CEA, 27, or 71%, were free of disease two years after surgery.

When a patient with a history of colorectal cancer, but seemingly free of disease, presents with levels not only repeatedly above normal (greater than 5 ng/ml) but above the levels found in some nonmalignant conditions (greater than 10 ng/ml), thorough re-examination of the patient to locate the site of possible disease progression is indicated. In 14 such patients further diagnostic methods showed local recurrences in four, metastasis limited to the liver in six, and other metastasis in four. In conclusion, in patients with colorectal carcinoma postoperative elevated CEA plasma levels are a sign of poor prognosis.

The survival rate of patients with colorectal carcinoma and hepatic metastases -- without therapy of metastases -- is 6 to 8 months and not differs from the survival rate of these patients whose primary tumor was inoperable by local reason.

The presence of a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level following a potentially curative operation has been suggested as a more selective indicator for reoperation.

Besides, the study of the relationship with the pathologic stage points out the scanty usefulness of the C.E.A. test in the early diagnosis of gastroenteric neoplasms (Dukes A-B-C1 = 29.2%; CH stage = 88.1%). The use of C.E.A. test during the follow up seemed us of fundamental importance. We observed that: a) after radical surgery, 72% of the patients showed a normalization of C.E.A. values; b) there is a significant relationship between clinical course and C.E.A. as it can predict, sometimes several months earlier, the occurrence of relapses and metastases; c) there is also a close relationship (P less than 0.001) between the modifications of the antigen under chemotherapy and the clinical response.

The fact that the national death rate from carcinoma of the colon and rectum has remained static over the past two decades is strong incentive for future investigation of measures to allow detection in its early and more favorable stage. Although no significant improvements in surgical techniques have afforded improvement in longevity, certain technical factors are known to inhibit tumor implantation during surgery. Data suggest that the extent of en bloc resection is the most crucial factor in avoiding recurrence. Extensive use of radiotherapy as the sole method of treatment or as preoperative or postoperative adjunctive therapy remains investigational, but it seems likely that this form of treatment will play an increasing role in the future. Preoperative radiotherapy seems to be useful in reducing the stage of the neoplasm and the incidence of extraserosal involvement; postoperative radiotherapy is beneficial for palliation. Chemotherapy, particularly with the fluorinated pyrimidines (5-FU and 5-FUDR), is being evaluated for its usefulness in lengthening survival time; response to 5-FU is occasionally dramatic. It remains for major investigational centers to clarify the role of combination chemotherapy in metastatic disease. Immunotherapy at present must be considered an unproven mode of treatment and of inconclusive benefit in any stage of colorectal carcinoma. Carcinoembryonic antigen assay is a useful prognostic and diagnostic tool in localizing primary tumor and in subsequent evaluation of response to treatment."}

Both methods measured CEA concentrations down to 1 microgram/1. The ability of the two assays to discriminate between positive and negative values in patients with urogenital and gastrointestinal cancer was similar. The response to recurrences of colorectal carcinoma was also similar, and the CEA fluctuation was parallel after surgery. The CEA-Roche assay generally showed good correlation between measured and theoretical values at both low and high levels. Under our test conditions, the disparity between indirect and direct values was 14 microgram/1 +/- 8 (n = 4) in the range 18--32 microgram/1, and this must be taken into consideration in interpreting the CEA-Roche test. The CEA-RIAKIT measured too low values as compared to both the CEA-Roche and the theoretical values. The discrepancy increased with increasing CEA values, and the ability to distinguish between high CEA concentrations (greater than 15 microgram/1) was poor. The explanation seems to be that the anti-CEA sera used in this assay show a lower affinity for plasma CEA than for tumour-extracted CEA. Immunochemical differences between sample CEA and CEA used for calibration of the standard curves must be considered in evaluation of CEA assays."}

Examples of this latter category include the changes in urinary hydroxyproline output in patients with bone metastases or the altered levels of serum acute phase proteins in neoplasia in general.7 Tumor-derived markers may be produced by either the tumor cell population itself, e.g., CEA, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and other oncofetal antigens, inappropriate hormones such as ACTH etc., or by their supporting framework (stroma), e.g., the osteolysins of human breast cancer.3"}

All 16 patients had previously had curative resection of colorectal cancer; 13 in the rectum or rectosigmoid and three in the right colon. There were 13 Dukes' C and three Dukes' B cancers. All had been followed clinically and by CEA testing at three monthly intervals and were considered free of disease (NED) at time of CEA elevation. The median disease free interval was 13 months (range 4-57 months) and the median CEA prompting admission for second-look operation was 21 ng/ml (range 10-56 ng/ml). The sites of recurrence were liver in six, lung in two and localized disease in six. Two patients had negative exploration for recurrence and were found to have cholelithiasis only (one of these later died of metastases). Resection for cure was done in seven and palliative resection or biopsy only was done in nine patients. At this time, four patients are NED (12-37 months), five are living with disease (10-16 months) and seven have died of disease (2-12 months). The CEA test provides a method of early detection of recurrence and may permit surgical retrieval in selected patients and earlier initiation of palliation in other patients. The longterm effects in patient salvage remain to be defined."}

Serial carcinoembryonic antigen assays should be performed every two months.

Although the assay should not be used as a screening test for cancer of the bowel, it may serve as a helpful adjunct in the diagnosis of digestive system tumours in conjunction with other routine investigations. More important is the utilization of the radioimmunoassay for CEA under the following circumstances: 1. Preoperatively as an indicator of tumour dissemination based upon the quantitative concentrations of CEA in the circulation. 2. As an indicator of potentially curative resection manifested by a decrease in circulating concentrations of CEA to below detectable limits. 3. As an early warning of recurrent tumour growth, by detecting the reappearance of CEA in the circulation of a patient rendered CEA-negative after tumour resection, 3 months to 2 years or more before any other presently available technology can detect clinical evidence of recurrence. This last observation is now under investigation for its potential value as an indicator for second-look surgery in patients who have undergone potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancers."}

Tumor measurements as an index of response to therapy were strongly correlated with survival, whereas changes in CEA values and patient survival were not correlated at a statistically significant level. Serial CEA measurements were perhaps of some value in predicting progression of malignant disease, and were roughly comparable to serum alkaline phosphatase assay in assessing response of liver metastasis to chemotherapy. Overall, serial CEA measurements added little to the standard clinical assessment of patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma receiving chemotherapy."}

Although approximately 80% of patients are amenable to surgery, cure is only possible for 40%. Survival of patients is closely related to disease staging at the time of surgery, being poorer for patients presenting with locally advanced disease or with distant metastases. Patients who undergo curative resections and are categorized as having a high risk of developing recurrence, such as those with regionally involved lymph nodes, should be subjected to studies of adjuvant therapy. Although the definite role of such studies is still under evaluation, there already exist studies of chemotherapy with 5FU, chemoimmunotherapy with 5FU-BCG, and radiation therapy, suggesting the beneficial effect of these treatment modalities based on prolongation of the disease-free interval and survival of patients. The status of available treatments for patients with advanced disease is poor. There exists no single or multidrug regimen capable of producing significant tumor regression to improve the patient's quality of life and survival. Accordingly, the active clinical investigation of newer and potentially effective chemotherapeutic agents should continue. The role of present immunotherapy is not fully determined, although several studies suggest its potential usefulness in the adjuvant and the advanced situations. Serial determinations of CEA are extremely helpful in the postsurgical monitoring of patients receiving adjuvant treatments and also in the follow-up of patients undergoing therapy for overt metastatic disease."}

We found 25 patients whose CEA levels met the recommended criteria for significance; however, in 9 of these patients the rises were transient. Eight had no clinical evidence of recurrent cancer and they might have had negative second-look surgery had this been done because of CEA rises alone. The use of the CEA nomogram merely eliminated laboratory variation as a cause of the CEA rise. It did not, however, rule out biologic causes of CEA rises, other than that of cancer, especially benign liver disease. We were unable to differentiate benign from malignant rises on the basis of CEA changes alone. Preoperative CEA values helped to separate the two rises. Transient rises usually began earlier. Malignant CEA rises were more likely to be exponential. The rate of rise alone did not discriminate between the two rises. Thus, although serial CEA levels were helpful in making the decision for reexploration, they did not substitute for complete clinical assessment."}

CIC was determined in an average of seven serial samples per patient by inhibition of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). CEA assays were performed by the Hanson Z-gel method. Two distinct patterns of serial CIC have emerged. In seven patients with no known tumor recurrences, serial CEA levels and CIC oscillated regularly and were inversely related. In seven of eight patients whose tumors recurred, both CEA and CIC rose together. In three patients with elevated plasma CEA levels due to inflammatory bowel disease, serial Ag-Ab complex concentrations did not vary, nor did separated Ag or Ab fractions inhibit ADCC. These data suggest that, in patients following curative resection of colorectal cancer, serial changes in circulating immune complexes may discriminate between transient CEA elevations which occur despite no known tumor recurrence and tumor recurrence which is beyond the capacity of adequate host antitumor defense."}

Carcinoembryonic antigen is elevated in the plasma of approximately 30% of patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma, 50% of patients with ovarian carcinoma, and 60% of patients with cervical carcinoma. The incidence of elevated plasma CEA is directly related to stage of disease, and in ovarian cancer to cell type. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoretic studies have indicated that CEA from ovarian and cervical cancers is similar to colonic cancer CEA. Tumor staining for CEA by the immunoperoxidase method (indicating a CEA concentration of greater than or equal to 3.0 microgram/g tissue) is positive in about one-half of the patients with elevated plasma CEA levels. However, there is no definite relationship between tumor and plasma antigen levels. Carcinoembryonic antigen levels charcteristically return to normal within 8 weeks following complete surgical removal of tumor. In contrast, antigenemia often persists up to 4 months following curative radiation therapy. A progressive rise in plasma CEA has preceded clinical diagnosis of recurrence in about half of the patients studied. Serial plasma CEA determinations in patients whose plasma or tumors initially contain elevated amounts of antigen provides information concerning the biologic behavior of malignancy which may be of clinical significance to the patient."}

Postoperatively, elevated alpha2-PAG levels were found in 10 of 18 patients (56%) without clinical evidence of recurrence whereas elevated CEA levels were present in three (16%). In patients who developed clinical evidence of tumour recurrence, alpha2-PAG levels were elevated in 8 of 13 (62%) while CEA levels were uniformly abnormal.

A false negative preoperative CEA value was found in 40% of the patients with gastric carcinoma and 32% with colorectal carcinoma. Patients with a negative preoperative CEA value, and those with only slightly elevated values, had a distinctly better prognosis regarding initial operability and tendency to postoperative recurrence than patients with primarily markedly elevated values. With few exceptions, the development of distant metastases was detected earlier and more easily with the CEA test than by the usual routine follow-up methods. However, in the event of isolated local recurrence the CEA test was positive in only 1 of 5 patients. This reflects the direct correlation between tumor size and CEA elevation. The CEA test is a valuable supplement in the follow-up of patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma."}

There was a clear-cut regression of the disease in only 9 instances. In all 9, the CEA clearly dropped or maintained low valles throughout the period of regression. No patient in regression had a rise or maintained an elevated CEA level. These changes in CEA followed closely the clinical response of our patient to the use of a particular agent, although for the Nitrosourea compounds there may be a tendency to lower the CEA regardless of the patient's tumor response to the drug. This could be due to the fact that the Nitrosoureas produce a diffuse block of cellular activity, both at the nucleous and cytoplasm; while other compounds act as alkylating agents or by inhibition of enzymes involved in the metabolism of nucleic acids (i.e., 5-FU inhibiting thymidylate synthetase). In general, longer survival was found in those patients who had initially lower levels of CEA as compared to those with high initial levels. The patients with a favorable CEA response to the treatment (falling CEA or maintained low value), even in many who did not show a clinical response had a longer survival than the group with rising or stable high levels.

To further define and determine the usefulness of CEA, 1100 CEA determinations have been made over the past two years at The Ohio State University Hospitals on patients with a variety of malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Correlation of CEA titers with history and clinical course has yielded interesting results not only in cancers of entodermally derived tissues, for which CEA has become an established adjunct in management, but also in certain other neoplasms and inflammatory states. The current total of 225 preoperative CEA determinations in colorectal carcinomas shows an 81% incidence of elevation, with postoperative titers remaining elevated in patients having only palliative surgery but falling to the negative zone after curative procedures. An excellent correlation exists between CEA levels and grade of tumor (more poorly differentiated tumors showing lower titers). Left-side colon lesions show significantly higher titers than right-side lesions. CEA values have been shown to be elevated in 90% of pancreatic carcinomas studied, in 60% of metastatic breast cancers, and in 35% of other tumors (ovary, head and neck, bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers). CEA levels in 35 ulcerative colitis patients show elevation during exacerbations (51%). During remissions titers fall toward normal, although in 31% still remaining greater than 2.5 ng/ml. In the six colectomies performed, CEA levels all fell into the negative zone postoperatively. Forty percent of adenomatous polyps showed elevated CEA titers (range 2.5-10.0) that dropped following polypectomy to the negative zone. Preoperative and postoperative CEA determinations are important in assessing the effectiveness of surgery. Serial CEA determinations are important in the follow-up period and in evaluation of the other modes of therapy (e.g., chemotherapy). These determinations of tumor antigenicity give the physician added prognostic insight into the behavior of the tumor growth. Rectal examination with guaiac determinations, sigmoidoscopy, cytology, barium enema, and a good clinical evaluation remain the primary tools for detecting colorectal disease. However, in the high-risk patient suspicious of developing cancer, CEA determinations as well as colonoscopy are now being used increasingly and provide additional highly valuable tools in the physician's armamentarium."}

A total of 46 patients with curative resection for colorectal carcinoma were studied. This included 23 patients with recurrent tumors compared to 23 long-term survivors without signs of recurrence at the time of the study. Preoperative CEA determinations were a good prognostic tool comparable to pathological staging of the specimen. Post operative CEA monitoring was the earliest sign of recurrence in 14 of 23 patients and was positive at the time of recurrence determined by other methods in 20; it was negative in only three cases. The incidence of false positive results among the non recurrent group became a lesser problem when repeated elevated values were required before considering the patient as having a recurrence. From these data, it seems reasonable to propose the use of a second-look operation in patients with maintained elevation of circulating CEA and no clinical signs of tumor presence, if we are to treat recurrence at an early stage. Chemotherapy would be an alternative way to deal with this problem, since the absence of clinical signs in general correlate with small bulk of tumor which at this time may be more susceptible to chemotherapeutic agents."}

The fact that elevation of CEA level can also be observed in other types of carcinomas and in several nonmalignant conditions greatly limits the value of the CEA test for the early diagnosis of colorectal carcinomas.

Through persistent clinical research efforts, the CEA test has developed into a useful although complex disease monitor for colorectal cancer. Although improved or prolonged survival from its use has not been demonstrated, CEA monitoring may allow more knowledgeable patient management. Several reports indicate that postoperative serial CEA assays may identify patients with early recurrence, especially when assays are done frequently. Patients with elevated pretreatment CEA levels usually showed progressively rising titers before other objective evidence of recurrence was apparent. A progressively rising CEA titer correlated well with recurrent cancer, but a normal CEA could not be used as proof of its absence. Persistently elevated CEA titers post-treatment was caused either by persistent disease or by nontumor-related factors. The CEA assay was not a substitute for clinical follow-up but was an adjunct in the diagnosis of eary recurrence. Patients with elevated CEA levels caused by localized disease treated by radiation therapy demonstrated a marked fall in serial CEA levels if all CEA-producing tumor was localized within the radiation portal. The use of pretreatment CEA values plus the pattern of CEA reponse to irradiation may help in the selection of fulguration versus abdominoperineal resection as primary treatment for rectal cancer. Persistently low serial CEA titers after irradiation therapy correlated with disease control. The use of frequent serial CEA assays in patients treated with chemotherapy compared well with other parameters as a monitor of disease progression or regression. When used with other clinical parameters, serial CEA trends appeared to be a useful adjunct in assessing the effectiveness of chemotherapy. A fall in circulating CEA or the stabilization of a rising titer after starting chemotherapy usually indicated an effective regimen, whereas a rising CEA titer may signal may signal the need to initiate or to change chemotherapy."}

Serial CEA radioimmunoassays were performed on 16 patients receiving preoperative radiation therapy of rectal cancer or irradiation of recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer. Radiation therapy of localized colorectal cancer reliably reduced previously elevated circulating CEA titers. Significant decrease of elevated CEA titers with accumulating doses of irradiation may indicate that the bulk of CEA-producing tumor is within the radiation treatment portal and assist in patient management decisions. The decrease of circulating CEA with preoperative radiation therapy was of short duration and may indicate that surgical resection should not be delayed more than 6-8 weeks after irradiation. Because of the high frequency of false positive and false negative results, CEA must be used only in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory parameters."}

Pre-operative and post-operative sera from 11 patients with primary adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract and from one patient with ulcerative colitis were then tested for their capacity to inhibit the agglutination of the sensitized cells in the presence of a predetermined amount of goat anti-CEA serum. Positive sera were defined as those which inhibited agglutination at dilutions of greater than 1:8. The pre-operative sera from 11 of the 12 patients inhibited agglutination at dilutions of 1:16 or greater. The one negative serum was from a patient with primary adenocarcinoma of the colon in the stage of Dukes' C. At one month post-resection, the PHI titer of six patients with colon cancer and of the patient with ulcerative colitis was less than or equal to 1:8. However, by 4 months post-resection, all but 3 of the patients had PHI titers in the positive range. These elevated titers were accompanied by recurrence of tumor growth and/or metastatic dissemination. A radioimmunoassay was used to quantitate CEA in 22 of the sera which had been tested by PHI. When positive sera were defined as those which inhibited agglutination at dilutions of greater than 1:8 and contained CEA in excess of 5 ng per ml, the results of the two procedures were in agreement for 17 of the 22 specimens.

The survival of all patients receiving BCG alone has not reached the 75 percentile yet, and the difference from controls is currently estimated at the 18% level. The combination of 5-FU plus BCG (studied in 32 patients) may be superior to BCG alone at this time, in that it appears to more effectively protect against tumor recurrence (75 percentile not yet reached compared to control, (p = 0.08). The survival of patients on 5-FU plus BCG also appears to be improved (p = 0.09). No patients have expired compared to a 75 percentile survival of 16.6 months in the control.

The fact that elevation of CEA level can also be observed in other types of carcinomas and in several non malignant conditions greatly limit the value of the CEA test for the early diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma. Thus, the CEA assay should not be used as a screening test for cancer. Repeated CEA measurements, however, appear to be of importance for the evaluation of tumor resection and the detection of tumor recurrence. The only localized tumors known to produce elevation of CEA above the levels observed in non malignant diseases are carcinomas of the large bowel and the pancreas. In carcinomas derived from other organs a marked increase of CEA level is always associated with the presence of distant metastasis. Therefore at the present time the clinical applications of the CEA radioimmunoassay should be limited to the differential diagnosis of patients with suspicion of primary colorectal or pancreatic carcinoma, to the detection of distant metastasis in other types of carcinomas and to the post operative follow up of patients who had elevated levels of CEA before surgery. Well-controlled studies are still needed to determine if therapeutic decisions based on CEA results can lead to improved survival."}

Ninety-four patients with carcinoma of the colon have been followed with serial determinations of plasma CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels over a 3-year period using the Hansen assay. Nine hundred twelve CEA determinations have been made in these patients. Plasma CEA levels rose in 90% of the instances of clinical progression documented in these patients. In 30% of patients, this rise indicated progression 6 months or more before it was detected by standard clinical methods. Unfortunately, a few patients never developed elevated CEA levels even though disease clearly progressed. False positive results have also been encountered, with significant elevations occurring in patients who have since remained without evidence of disease for several months. Our data indicate that at least two sequential elevated CEA values, the second being higher, must be a minimal criterion for consideration of possible progression of disease. Even with this standard, we have encountered false positive results in 10% of our patients, indicating recurrence or progression where none has occurred clinically. CEA measurement is of limited usefulness for 30 days after curative surgery, because the elevation of CEA levels due to the original amount of tumor present as well as due to surgery per se may persist for this length of time in a significant number of patients. On the other hand, CEA levels have responded to chemotherapy in close correlation with observed clinical course in those patients with metastatic disease treated in this series. Initial pretherapy CEA values have so far proved to be good prognostic indicators of disease course following complete resection. With an initial CEA value of less than 2.5 ng/ml of plasma, recurrent has been rare (1/20). If the pretreatment CEA was greater than 7.0 ng/ml, it has been the rule (7/9)."}

(author's transl)]. CEA is a beta1-glycoprotein (mol. w. approx. 200 000) which in embryonic life is usually found as a cell membrane associated antigen in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and pancreas. Furthermore, it is secreted into body fluids. In healthy adults a very low serum concentration may be found. The clinical significance of CEA lies in its increased formation in primary and secondary adenocarcinomas of colon and rectum and pancreatic carcinoma, where values of 20 ng/ml and more are observed. However, other gastrointestinal (e.g. oesophagus, stomach, gall-bladder) and extragastrointestinal tumors (e.g. lung, breast, urogenital, prostatic, ovarial carcinomas) as well as non-malignant diseases mainly of the GI tract (e.g. hepatitis, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, colitis, diverticulitis) may provoke less frequent and lower increases in the CEA level. Healthy smokers also tend to show a slight increase in CEA concentration. A certain relationship exists between the CEA level and the size and extent of the tumor so that a decrease following operation may account for complete tumor removal, whereas a persistent or recurring increase in the CEA level is highly suspicious of metastases and/or recurrent tumor. Difficulties in proving and purifying CEA are mainly caused by multiple cross-reactions of CEA with other substances, e.g. blood group substances (A, B, Lea, Leb) and normal or other antigens (NGP, NCA, CEX, CCEA 2, NCA 2, CCA-III, FSA, BCGP). The radioimmunoassay is the most suitable method to determine CEA levels in body fluids. The 3 procedures used differ in the precipitation of the specific immune complex by ammonium sulphate (AS), Z-gel (ZG) or a second antibody (SA). Depending on the method, the upper normal limit in serum or plasma corresponds to approximately 2.5 (AS, ZG) or 12.5 (SA) nanogramme/milliliter.

If the study of tumor immunology is to have a profound impact on clinical medicine, certain hypotheses must be proven to be valid. First and foremost, it must be demonstrated that malignant tissue possesses antigenic substances (probably protein moieties) that are unique to that particular malignant process. In addition, these antigenic substances must be very similar in histologically similar tumors. Second, the host defense mechanisms must be capable of reacting to these tumor-associated antigens. The reaction is, of course, necessary in order to develop both diagnostic and therapeutic routes of application. The reaction of the immunologic system to these tumor-associated antigens could be monitored as an early serodiagnostic tool for subclinical cancer, and the cytotoxic reaction holds great promise as an immunotherapeutic tool. The essence of tumor immunologic research can thus be stated in the form of the following questions: 1. Do histologically similar cancers from identical primary sites share common tumor-associated antigens? 2. Does the immunologic system react to these antigens? 3. Can this reaction be assayed on one hand for serodiagnosis and augmented on the other for immunotherapy? Specific antigens have been found in animal tumors and have been divided into two classes: the viral induced tumors, which share common antigens when caused by the same viral agent, and carcinogen-induced tumors, which appear to have unique antigenic determinants for each tumor. In recent years a great many human tumors have been found to have tumor-associated antigens; these include colonic carcinoma, neuroblastoma, melanoma, soft tissue and osteogenic sarcoma, bladder carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma. This report includes evidence for the existence of such antigens in adenocarcinoma of the ovary and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. The laboratory evidence that has been presented would suggest that there are both a cell-mediated response and humoral response to the antigenic determinants of these two gynecologic cancers. It would appear that the mediated (lymphocyte) effect is considerably more cytotoxic and definitive than the humoral factors measured. In addition, the allogenic experiments would suggest strongly that indeed (at least with regard to these two cancers) histologically similar cancers from the same organ share common antigenic determinants. The identification and isolation of these tumor-associated antigens appears complex. The complexity is increased when one studies patients afflicted with these cancers for plasma carcinoembryonic antigens. This antigen, which was thought to be specific for adenocarcinoma of the colon, is found in the blood of a significant number of patients with adenocarcinoma of the ovary and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix."}
